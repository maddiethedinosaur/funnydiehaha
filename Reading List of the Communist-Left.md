## Introduction

I've decided to finish this document and write a short introduction. My goal of this is to offer anyone curious an introduction to the communist movement, and its contemporary continuation: the communist-left. This document is supposed to be short, and was mostly not compiled by me, but I did add stuff I thought was important.
