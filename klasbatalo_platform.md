# The Platform of Klasbatalo
![Unofficial Klasbatalo Logo](

Klasbatalo is a communist organization and as such aims to push working class struggle to the emancipation of the working class. At all times Klasbatalo seeks to draw the link between particular struggles of the proletariat to the totality of capitalist barbarism and formulate and clarify the path towards the communist future. In this Klasbatalo pushes constantly for the political autonomy of the working-class, pushing the proletariat to shed all influence of bourgeois politics and institutions, and towards its own self-created organs of political power. The proletariat has no interest with any section of the bourgeoisie nor can it win power through the capitalist state machinery. The only way forward is for the proletariat to smash the capitalist state through struggle and institute its own class dictatorship in order to impose its own image on history. The following programmatic points are not arbitrary declarations. On the contrary they are the result of the lessons from the long history of proletarian struggle and clarified through the scientific methodology of Marxism.         

## Decadence, Imperialism and War

Today capitalism exists in a period of decadence, imperialism, and war. While communists reject the bourgeois conception of history and its obsession with dates and pinpoints, and instead understand the movement of history in the dialectical sense like that of a rolling of film to which the class plays the tragic protagonist, Klasbatalo says with confidence that by the opening of the first world war capitalism was undeniably in its period of decadence.

Decadence follows the evolution of capitalism from its ascendant to its descendent form, or period of decadence – the point at which it entered its imperialist phase, meaning that capital had reached a concentration and expanded as far as it could within the boundaries of nation-states. Now it needed not only to expand its access to resources, but to expand its capital and markets to the rest of the world with two consequences: 1. That in order to maintain a balance which favored one imperialist power against others it had to maintain the military force in order to accomplish this at a scale unheard of before, and 
2. In the lead-up to the First World War, military spending had gone from less than 1% to 4% of the total domestic product for the total worth of the British economy and the rising competing German economy as well, affecting all competing imperialist powers.
Here we have a qualitative shift with a second consequence. This means that it was no longer simply the national market that was the main regulator of capitalism’s cyclical ups and downs, its rise to a period of accumulation reaching points of crisis, following the tendency of the rate of profit to fall, cleaning out of the unprofitable enterprises that couldn’t survive and a greater concentration by those that remain and then a new cycle of development. Now this cycle had been changed to one which was no longer being contained within the national 

economy but now to one that had to be impressed on the world through imperialist force – imposing one’s markets and unequal exchange upon former colonies, lesser and weaker imperialisms, etc. Capitalism’s cycle of growth and decline had now changed – no longer was the crisis resolvable within the nation state, but only resolvable in the antagonism between various imperialist powers. The cycle now became one beginning with a new period of accumulation – a period of relative stability and boom – and then again a crisis for which its resolution no longer consisted of cleaning out the older, weaker capitals, but of war… the destruction of constant capital and the lowering of the total cost of the organic composition of capital. In other words, capitalists now have to pay in order to make their profits from labour, parts, machinery, and plants, whereas in the period of ascendance capital cleaned out old, inefficient, and unprofitable capital during crisis and decline. The period of decadence physically destroyed whole chunks of constant and organic capital thus lowering the cost of labour and destroying plant machinery and infrastructure. This starts a new period of accumulation. This is a qualitative change far different from the period of ascendance. This is what defines the period of decadence. It has plunged humanity into two world wars so far, with the continual pressures of regional wars that have been going on for the last half-century, following the Second World War. Basically decadence isn’t that capitalism can no longer grow or develop the means of production, but that it has blocked humanity from satisfying its needs without the tremendous contradictions of the capitalist mode of production condemning a large portion of humanity into the shackles of wage-labour. It has gone beyond that to where the human race is facing a global disaster. Humanity is presented with only two options; socialism or barbarism; and it is the proletariat alone as the sole revolutionary subject that can decide against barbarism and towards socialism. Despite war and economic assaults on the working class, Klasbatalo rejects the vulgar determinist view that we must simply wait for capitalism to run its course and the proletariat will mechanically rise up against it. The past one hundred years of horrendous barbarism have proven this conception to be false for it only presents half of the equation. The other half is the need for the presence of a revolutionary party that can express the political will of the working class and guide it towards the communist future. While this party arises organically out of the struggle of the class itself, for us its existence is not a waiting game but the result of real revolutionary work today.


## Unions

While it is true that at the start of its political development, unions did serve as a tool of class struggle for the proletariat, they are no longer revolutionary since their existence has been recuperated by the capitalist state and are thus organs of the bourgeoisie whose interests lie in opposition to that of the working class. It is true to an extent that unions represent the basic economic struggle of the working class, the union form always limits (if not hinders entirely) the working-class, even in the struggle for basic demands. In fact, unions have their own agenda to push in the capitalist order. Historically speaking, through  

the development of capitalism, unions have become increasingly tied to the capitalist state for the purpose of keeping class struggle mediated rather than self-controlled, divided rather than united, and bureaucratized with one thousand strings tying them to the state. With this the capitalist nature of unions is material and not a problem of will or incorrect leadership. Neither communists, nor more importantly the working class itself, can take over the union for revolutionary aims. Rather, the working class must aim to create its own organs of control and struggle, the strike committee and the soviet. Despite being capitalist organs, communists recognize the objective level of struggle in different situations of the class struggle and fight inside trade union struggles, not to win over the union but the working class itself. Even when trapped inside the trade union, the class struggle at its core remains proletarian. While we reject taking any positions inside unions, including shop stewardships, communists fight inside these struggles politically to push the class in the communist direction.

## Elections

While communists do not reject electoralism on principle in the anarchist sense, in tactical terms the current period has rendered the question of communist participation in elections as increasingly infeasible. As the capitalist order matured and its natural methods of governance solidified, the possibility of running in elections even as a propagandistic strategy began to wither away. It is clear to us, and believe it to be deeply felt in the working class, that parliamentarism is no more than a celebration of sophists and a farce. The immense pressure of capital’s own necessity rules the day and is organized and implemented in the non-elective back channels of the state. The proletariat cannot fight for its interests through this terrain but only in the struggle itself. With this said, Klasbatalo approaches elections on a tactical level. In a situation where communist participation would be beneficial, an event we see as incredibly unlikely, communists must advocate abstentionism by denouncing the election as a charade by the bourgeoisie and refusing to take seat if they are won.

## Nationalism and National Liberation

The existence of the modern nation-state is predicated upon the emergence of capitalism. The ascendant bourgeoisie, in correspondence with the development of its economic order, needed a political apparatus to organize and impose its rule in a given territory. Since the capitalist class’ objective was to assume control over the sphere of production of said territory, nation-building projects were historically necessary and always represent the interests of the national bourgeoisie. Following this, support for nation-building projects was, in the 19th century, seen as a tactical issue: if the development of a nation-state could lead to a consequent development of the capitalist system, it was to be supported. However,  

in the current period, that of decadent capitalism, global capital relies on nation-states to maintain local conditions favourable to accumulation and maintain the imperialist pecking order. It purposefully disrupts development in the less-developed nations through tools like Forex and intellectual property rights, thus reinforcing the asymmetrical relations between the core and periphery; and the periphery countries are thereby forced to sell their available natural resources to the core, in order to gain hegemonic currency so that they can buy capital-intensive commodities. A simple example of this asymmetry: the Democratic Republic of the Congo exports resources like diamonds, copper, gold, and cobalt, and imports more capital-intensive commodities, including the very machinery necessary for mining, on which their economy depends. This creates a mutual dependency: while the core depends on the exploitation of the periphery for its accumulation, the periphery is dependent on imperial centres to provide more capital-intensive commodities which offer the possibility of being competitive in the global market. We saw many nations become officially sovereign during the course of the 20th century; in reality, they are anything but: they must choose between integration or collapse, and find themselves at the whims of a world system. Whether it be states at the core of imperialism, or states on the periphery, National Self- Determination is not possible in the current world order. 

What’s more, national liberation movements, have, historically, always led to an assault on the workers. Remaining competitive on the world market means the continued exploitation of the working class by the new national bourgeoisie, and they will crush any resistance, as seen in the route of communists and worker organizations in Turkey and China in the 20’s. They cannot be used by communists in a tactical attempt to sow disorder in the global capitalist system for the ends of a workers’ revolution. In fact, the emergence of new competing sections of the capitalist class are inherent to and express an assumed truth to the bourgeois terrain itself and its shifting sands. The real class tension ingrained in the economic and political framework of modern society are erased or hidden by means of an abstraction: that of the citizen. Nationalism is the ideological tool by which the interests of the proletariat are sacrificed to those of the bourgeoisie. The only way for the proletariat to express their interest is through internationalism.

## The Left Wing of Capital

All organizations belonging to the camps of Trotskyism, Stalinism, and Social Democracy compose the left wing of the political terrain of capitalist society. Beyond radical rhetoric, all of these camps ultimately function for the preservation of the exploitation of the proletariat by spreading illusions and leading the class away from their own terrain of struggle and into the hands of the bosses, shovelling them into the parliamentary circus, unions, and into the most narrow and contained street reformism while undermining the 

possibility of the proletariat gaining true political autonomy. In this sense, these camps represent the last barricades of the capitalist state, perhaps the most recent glaring example is the electoral victory of the leftist Syriza coalition, which peddled the illusory hopes that the working class can seek a more ‘just’ capitalism in order to buy time for the bosses’ assault on basic living conditions and wages. Klasbatalo sees no possibility for dialogue with the leadership of these camps and wishes to dispel their rhetoric and reveal their tactics to the working-class. Klasbatalo also wishes to show the petty bourgeois character of single issue movements. This does not mean that we do not take a position on issues such as racism or sexism. On the contrary, we proclaim that these are real problems which the class faces but that they are problems which only the proletariat can answer through the unification of its struggle. While Klasbatalo recognizes the threat of the left wing of capital it does not fear brushing shoulders with the rank-and-file of such camps in the struggle itself. Indeed, while these militants’ adherence to leftist ideology may preclude common work at times, Klasbatalo recognizes that many of these workers are well meaning but fell for the ideological trap. Klasbatalo seeks to dispel these illusions in the class struggle including to members of the rank-and-file within these camps.

## United Fronts and Antifascism 

Klasbatalo rejects forming alliances with any bourgeois parties including the most leftist ones. Such alliances are opportunistic and fail to recognize that revolution emerges out of objective material conditions. Such tactical maneuvers to gain influence fail to recognize that revolution requires both a the working-class fighting on its own terrain and the need for an autonomous political party unifying the class. Such alliances ultimately usher the proletariat into the arms of bourgeois parties and guts proletarian organizations of the ability to criticize all forces of bourgeois domination. Klasbatalo also rejects the notion that the most left wing bourgeois parties can represent the interests of the working-class. For us, advocating concepts such as a “workers’ government”, that of social democratic or leftist coalition governments, administering the bourgeois state, ultimately confuse and divert the working-class away from the task of seizing political power and the success of proletarian dictatorship. While we reject political alliances with bourgeois parties, we remain committed to fighting with all workers in their immediate struggle against the bosses’ assault. 

In light of this, Klasbatalo recognizes anti-fascism as a tool of the ruling-class. This does not mean Klasbatalo does not see the real danger of these reactionary thugs when they attack workers on picket lines or threaten the lives of ethnic and other minorities. On the contrary, we are for the immediate defense of workers against these gangs. What we reject is the illusion that proposes “democracy or fascism” rather than “proletarian dictatorship or bourgeois dictatorship”. In reality, both democracy and fascism are different methods to achieve the same goal: the repression of the proletariat. Fascism and democracy are flip 

sides of the same coin and the bourgeoisie utilizes whatever method they think is best. Fascism and democracy are not in opposition to each other. If fascist gangs fail to squash workers’ resistance, we say with confidence the next cohort of assault will be military or police. Thus, Klasbatalo doesn’t emphasize a struggle against fascism alone, but rather the total forces of the capitalist order.

## Against Chauvinism, Oppression and Division

Communists fight against chauvinism, oppression and division of all kinds be it sexism, racism, homophobia, linguistic oppression, etc. Communists fight for a programme that reflects the universality of the proletariat beyond the interests of a particular trade or social group. We thus seek to unify the proletariat as a fighting whole against the totality of capital. It is therefore necessary that at all times communists oppose all forms of chauvinism and oppression which seeks to divide the proletariat from its united strength to ensure the capital domination. While many of these divisions predate capitalism, such as the oppression of women, –  which arose historically with the emergence of the family unit – , capitalism absorbs and adapts them into its own framework. While bourgeois political theorists may stutter egalitarian phrases, these prove themselves to be empty in light of capitals insatiable drive towards profit. Today, states are channeling money into migrant control forces not to simply keep migrants out of a given nation, but to ensure the migrants that enter are under the constant threat of the baton, crippling their ability to organize. Xenophobic demagogues as well serve to outsource this task to racist thugs and limit the ability for non-migrant and/or non-racialized workers from fighting around their common interests with migrant and/or racialized workers. Additionally, the conservatism of the family unit weighs like a nightmare on working women. It allows the bourgeoisie to pay women less and further perpetuate their status of oppression. All of this drives down wages across the board and hinders the ability for workers to fight as a single class. Nonetheless, communists recognize the proletariat as the only subject (other than the bourgeoisie) capable of imposing its own image on society, and thus is the only subject capable of ridding the world of all oppression and division. Indeed, it is through the working class fighting as a single class – across gendered, ethnic, and national lines –  that these divisions can begin to be shaken. For us, slogans like “there is no socialism without women’s liberation, there is no women’s liberation without socialism” echo a profound truth. It is the only the proletarian struggle that can do away with the muck of class society by affirming its universality as a class.   

## The Russian Revolution

The Russian revolution was the first time the working class took power over a whole country and held it through its own organs of power–workers councils. The road to 

revolution came as a result of the devastation of the 1st world war–4 million dead and starvation haunting the countryside. This on the heels of a monstrous defeat handed to the proletariat at the hands of the parties of the Second International, all of which took positions to oppose imperialist war and yet all but a few small exceptions joined in the jingoistic march to slaughter. The separation of the struggles into simple economic trade union struggle on one hand and their political expression tied to parliamentaryism throughout the Second International, in the lead up to the first world war left the majority of the organised proletariat confused and without a clear revolutionary internationalist direction. Only one major workers’ party consistently fought and argued for revolutionary defeatism with a clear position on imperialism; the Bolsheviks who fought consistently for class autonomy and unifying the power of the working class with the slogan: ‘All power to the soviets’.

There was mass support among the most militant and conscious of the international proletariat involving mutinies in solidarity at the front and strikes at home and in Germany, it was the heroic November 1918 revolt that put a final end to the war, though it was incapable of advancing the workers’ revolution to victory. It was the separation of the economic struggles and their political expression tied to parliamentaryism that characterised social democracy internationally and continued to play its destructive role. The isolation along with a weak understanding of what building ‘socialism’ through the expedient of state capitalism in a relatively underdeveloped country at first while waiting for the world revolution (an impossibility even in a very advanced one) was all about, meant this could not last. In the beginning, the Bolsheviks remembered this, noting that if the revolution remained isolated it would be doomed.

The isolation of the new Soviet state meant that it could not count on the material support and skills from economically and technologically advanced countries as well as limiting the effect of meaningful political contributions and critiques from the revolutionary international bodies of the class. In such circumstances, the revolution turned in on itself in the course of civil war, the retreat culminated in the crushing of the Kronstadt revolt; a last call to soviet power and the banning of factions within the Bolshevik party, putting an end to the open debate and vibrant discussion that contributed to rich praxis that made the revolution possible. Faced with isolation, the Bolsheviks pulled along with them the newly created Communist International. Faced with economic and military devastation, they began turning back to the opportunist politics of the Second International, as well as support for national ‘liberation’ struggles in order to ‘weaken’ imperialism. The adoption of the Sovnarkom (commissar system) early on modeled the tsarist and then provisional governments’ system of neighborhood and workplace control supplanting the soviets. The organisation of the red army supplanted the election of officers and elected militias. The key lesson here being that the proletariat cannot relinquish control of its dictatorship even to its own party at any point in the revolutionary process.


This being said, the Russian revolution showed us that a workers’ revolution is possible. The Russian revolution remains to be the most important lesson that the proletariat has to 

draw from in order to understand the process of its struggle. Lessons such as the soviets being the base of workers’ power, the party being an indispensable organ for the victory of the proletariat, and that the party cannot substitute itself for the class remain key lessons for revolutionaries to learn from today.

Based on the lessons of the revolutionary wave, Klasbatalo understands the need for an international communist party with a coherent programme to exist prior to the revolutionary upsurge on a global scale. Failure to create this organ would mean that the proletariat would enter into the decisive struggle without its revolutionary leadership and would thus be incapable of asserting itself as a unified, revolutionary class. Klasbatalo has no illusions that the revolution will not be a stubborn struggle, however the only way to ensure victory is by maintaining internationalist principles.

## Marxism

Marxism is the scientific methodology and political doctrine of the proletariat. Unlike previous classes, the proletariat is a class which does not aim to construct a new class society but fights for the abolition of class society. With this, the political standpoint of the proletariat is a consciousness of class society as a whole and the direction towards its abolition. The proletariat has no conjured utopia to which to fit reality into. On the contrary, communists seek to understand the real movement, to understand the tremors of the capitalist order that make possible the emergence of a new world. For the first time humanity no longer needs to be ruled by its own illusions, it no longer needs to claim historical facts as eternal truths, and through the emancipation of the universal subject it can become conscious of its own existence and directly satisfy its needs.

Marxism did not arise out of thin air. Its programmatic existence is constantly radiated by the real living being of the proletariat. Its thread is traced through and historically reflects the being of the class. In every struggle its name is posed again to various degrees of pitch. The revolutionary minority historically uses marxism as a methodology to best understand its practical application and bring it closest to the hearts of workers who themselves move towards it as they realize themselves as a class in struggle. With it revolutionaries attempt to attach the immediate situation with the final goal; the future communist society. With this in mind, Klasbatalo asserts that Marxism is not a scholarly affair but a doctrine of action.

## The Party 

The existence of a party cannot be separated from the existence of the working-class. The fact that a minority of the working-class organizes consciously and wills its activity towards the historic goal of the class as a whole is the result of the fact that the class itself tends to struggle in this direction due to its inherent relation to the existing productive process. In the same sense one cannot speak of a class in a true sense unless it expresses its own historic 

task pointing outside the present state of things. This task is clarified and crystalized by the revolutionary minority in the programme. For us, the programme assumes the lessons learned through the thread of the proletariat’s existence and struggle. But despite the programme being the red thread of the class as a whole which tends in the direction of communism, communist consciousness can only exist in a minority of the class before the revolution and even during it. For us it is no surprise that the majority of the class, despite it radiating its own historic task in its struggle, remains influenced by the ruling ideas of the ruling epoch—the ideas of the bourgeoisie. It is here that the role of the communist party is indispensable for the final victory of the working-class. The role of the party is to unify the proletariat as a class and push it in the communist direction. While we can historically recognize that the class can struggle to a very high degree, including up to insurrection, without the significant intervention of the party, a struggling working-class is unable to truly grapple with the task in front of it. 

Despite the party being an indispensable organ for working class victory, as it expresses the political autonomy of the proletariat in a programmatic sense, the party cannot substitute the class or just assume its leadership on a theoretical level alone. Such a conception is merely the flip side of the councilist mistake of rejecting the necessity of the party. Each conception falls into the trap of over emphasizing one side of the equation rather than considering the relation as a whole. Klasbatalo recognizes the importance of the quantitative-qualitative change in social participation in the proletarian semi-state which Lenin highlights so well. This is the deepening of a direct and conscious effort by humanity as a whole towards its own life. Nor can it cast aside the historic profoundness of Marx’s praise of the “working bodies” of the Paris Commune while still noting that the Communes would have been stronger if more of his party’s militants were there. It is also a mistake to assume the party can gain the leadership of the class on a purely programmatic basis. If the class could just wake up to its programme then the need for a party would be moot. The party must fight for the leadership of the class by demonstrating the truth of its programme in the struggle itself. At all times the party attempts to build links with the class even in periods of class defeat. Failure to do so would separate the programme from its living character and into a scholastic affair which would produce an organization of cadres incapable of leading the class. While we recognize the dialectical truth between the strength of the class and the strength of the party in the ebb and flow of struggle we reject any mechanistic scheme in dividing such periods.

While Klasbatalo is for a world communist party we do not claim to be this party or its only nucleus. The creation of the future world communist party can only be understood in its actual development and the regroupment of revolutionaries on an international scale.


## For Communism

Communism is the human community which has shed the muck of class society. It is the organization of society directly focused on the fulfillment of need in which the antagonism between the individual and collective is abolished. It is a world which knows no classes, property, state, or bureaucracy. In short, communism is the abolition of political society. What does the proletariat gain from the continuous assault on our standards of living? Nothing! Which side should the proletariat pick in the creeping shadow of total imperialist war? None! To hell with the bosses and their parliaments!  The proletariat has no nation and their own programme to impose! Away with this old world! The riddle of history has been solved! Workers of the world unite!
