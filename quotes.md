* "You can't respect the rights of a cop if you're beating him to death! If a trade union leader tries to address a meeting and we respond by shouting him down or dragging him off the stage and kicking his head in, it's absurd for us to say that we believe in freedom of speech. "The revolution will not be televised" -- nor will it be monitored by Amnesty International..." - Wildcat, Against Democracy
* "The central lesson that the Communist Left drew from the October Revolution and the counter-revolutionary process is that the proletariat cannot excuse itself from this role and delegate its power and the task of realising communism to others, not even to its own class party." - Internationalist Communist Tendency, Marxism or Idealism - Our Differences with the ICC
* "This tendency to create community by fighting against the conditions of our lives—and therefore against work, money, exchange, borders, nations, governments, police, religion, and race—has at times been called “communism”." - Prole.info, Work Community Politics War
* "We communists have already established ourselves as a major power. All factions, left and right eventually turn their eyes towards us and our destruction." - International Communist Workers Party, Manifesto of the International Communist Workers Party

* "While the trade union has as its object the defence of the sectional interests of the worker in so far as he belongs to a given trade or industry, the proletarian figures w. the Soviet as a member of a social class that has conquered political power and is running society, in so far as his interests have something in common with all workers of any trade whatsoever. What we have in the central Soviet is a political representation of the working class, with deputies representing local constituencies. National representatives of the various trades have no place in this schema at all; this should suffice to give the lie simultaneously to trade-unionist interpretations and to the reformist parody of hypothetical constituent assemblies of trades masquerading as Soviet-type institutions." - Amadeo Bordiga, The System of Communist Representation
* "All that is solid melts into air, all that is holy is profaned, and man is at last compelled to face with sober senses his real conditions of life, and his relations with his kind." - Karl Marx, Manifesto of the Communist Party
