### Capitalism:

1. Capitalism is a mode of production, not a system of management.
2. Capitalism comes in many forms, such as, private (most countries today, including the USA, UK, etc.), state (countries such as the USSR, Vietnam, Laos, etc.) and worker (co-ops, unions, etc.)

### Communism:

3. Communism is the society immediately following capitalism.
4. Communist society is characterised by a lack of commodity production, the state, classes, money, exchange, nations, borders, private property, wage-labour, the division of labour, schools, prisons, the family, cities, scarcity, etc.

### Proletarian Dictatorship:

5. The method to achieve communist society is the global, centralised proletarian class dictatorship.
6. Historically, the proletarian class dictatorship has been exercised via the soviets: councils of delegates centralised on various levels, the lowest being of a town or city and the highest being the planet itself (once the revolution has reached an international level).

### Party:

7. The revolutionary party is required for the revolution to succeed, and it must exist before the revolution itself.
8. The task of the revolutionary party is unifying workers' struggles, supplying the class with a revolutionary programme and leading it in the overthrow of capitalist society and the establishment of its class dictatorship.

### United-Frontism:

9. The internationals of the Stalinists, Maoists, Trotskyists, and Social Democrats are the internationals of the left-wing of capital and stand opposed to the class and its goals.
10. Thus, communists refuse all cooperation with and any support for, said groups.

### Unions:

11. Unions no longer serve proletarian interests and have been transformed into mere instruments of capital to strangle the class struggle.
12. Unions cannot be reclaimed for proletarian interests.

### Parliamentarism:

13. Parliamentarism is to be refused. Communists should not participate in elections and refuse voting for any supposed "lesser evil".
14. Historically, parliamentary and reformist movements lost their proletarian character and became servants to the interests of capital.
15. These movements remain that way today.

### National Liberation:

15. Struggles for national liberation have lost any progressive elements and therefore are not supported by communists.
16. Everything that the national liberation movements can do now is merely replace the ruling class with a new one.

### Internationalism:

17. The proletarian revolution must occur on a international level otherwise it is nothing.
18. The reasons why previous revolutions have failed are not due to the state or the vanguard, but because of their isolation to one country.

### "Actually Existing Socialism":

19. Nations which are supposed examples of "actually existing socialism" are capitalist countries dressed with labour slogans and red flags.
20. These revolutions failed to create socialism due to either their isolation to one country or a nationalist, not proletarian, revolution.
