<h1>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Burning and looting all illusions tonight</font></h1>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If we are here, it is not as professional activists
of anti-globalisation, trying to find a position of mediation between the
puppets of the economy and its ‘victims’, by acting on behalf of others
(the "invisible", the revolted proletarians against the IMF or the World
Bank, the refugees, the precarious workers.) We are not interested in representing
anyone, and we spit in the face of those who wish to represent us. We do
not understand exclusion as exclusion from the centers of economic decision-making
but as the loss of our everyday life and activity as proletarians because
of the economy.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">If we are here, it is not because we prefer
fair trade to free trade, it is not because we believe that globalisation
weakens the authority of nation-states. We are not here because we think
that the state is controlled by non-democratic institutions, nor because
we want more control over the market. We are here because all trade is
the trade of human misery, because all states are prisons, because democracy
conceals the dictatorship of capital.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">If we are here it is not because we see proletarians
as victims, nor because we want to place ourselves as their protectors.
We didn’t come here to be impressed by spectacular riots but to learn the
tactics of everyday class war by the strikers of Ansaldo and the disobedient
proletarians in the metal industry. We come here to exchange our own experiences
as the dispossessed of the whole world.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">If we are here, we do not come as members
of the numerous NGO’s, official lobbies, ATTAC or the rest of those who
merely wish to be included in the discussions over the modernisation of
capitalism and who hope that their proposals (e.g. tobin tax) will be able
to save capitalist social relations, i.e. the same relations which perpetuate
our alienation and exploitation.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">If we are here, it is as proletarians who
recognise capitalism not in the meetings of the various gangsters but in
the daily robbery of our lives in the factories, in the call-centers, as
unemployed, for the needs of the economy. We do not speak on behalf of
anyone, we start from our own conditions. Capitalism does not exist because
of the G8, the G8 exists because of capitalism. Capitalism is nothing but
the expropriation of our activity, which turns against us as an alien force.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Our festival against capital does not have
a beginning or an end, it is not a pre-determined spectacle, it does not
have a fixed date. Our future lies beyond all mediations, beyond nation-states,
beyond all attempts to reform capitalism. Our future lies in the destruction
of the economy.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">FOR THE TOTAL ABOLITION OF THE STATE AND
CAPITAL.</font>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">FOR THE WORLD HUMAN COMMUNITY.</font>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">PROLETARIANS AGAINST THE MACHINE.</font>
