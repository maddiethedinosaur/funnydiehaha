with capitalist peace!</font></font></h1></center>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">The war is already in our neighbour's. The Hungarian
and the Yugoslavian government, the NATO and the UCK, Clinton and the Pope...
they all try to convince us that this war - just like all other wars -
is the consequence of some fatal mistakes, of some surprising abnormality,
of a slight hitch in the smooth running of the democratic world system,
and it is the brainchild of certain mad leaders. They all claim to be fighting
for peace...</font>
<p><b><font face="Comic Sans MS">They talk to us of peace - and they drive
us into war!</font></b>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">But war is not a fatal mistake. Just on the
contrary. It's the essence of capitalism, and one of the bases of its functioning
is the permanent economic fight among the different fractions of capital.
Capital is inherently imperialist. Conquering and obtaining more and more
markets belong to its normal way of functioning. The multiplication of
centres of war is a necessarily phenomenon. And it is always the proletarians
who get the worse in the fight between the different fractions of capital.
War is taking place in our everyday life too: when we are forced to work,
when the maintenance of our mere life is getting more and more difficult...
But sometimes capitalist "peace" is replaced by open war.</font>
<p><b><font face="Comic Sans MS">War is always against the interests of
the proletariat!</font></b>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">What does war mean on the level of everyday
reality?</font>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">- death on the front line and in the trenches...</font>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">- death in the prison camps</font>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">- death in the refugee camps, by the side
of roads, next to mass graves...</font>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">- death at home, under the ruins of houses...</font>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">- conscriptions, mobilization... in order
to force us to massacre each other, to kill our proletarian brothers in
the interest of capital...</font>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">- compulsion of work, militarization of
work and the increasing of its intensity...</font>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">- hunger, misery, high prices, shortages...</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">This reality shows evidently that the war
is against the proletariat, against our interests and against our struggle.
This war is a new episode in the already endless list of attacks by the
worldwide capitalist State against the proletariat. This nth war is nothing
but a genuine product of the capitalist world of exploitation.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">This war in Yugoslavia is another step towards
the more generalised war through the "acceptance" (an "acceptance" that
is being imposed by terror and permanent blackmail!) by all of war as the
"natural" perspective for society in crisis. The majority of proletarians
passively watch the progression of massacres on their television screens.
Since the crisis is "natural", so unemployment, misery, all kinds of sacrifices
also become "natural". You no longer protest, you start to accept to sacrifice
yourself. <b>And with this same logic, you will soon find yourself on the
train leaving for the front!</b></font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">This is not surprising since the majority
of proletarians today, especially in Europe, remain prisoners of patriotism
and other bourgeois ideological frameworks such as "pacifism", "anti-imperialism"
or still "anti-fascism" (all of which defend democracy, the social order
of capitalism ). This is not surprising either when we can see that the
international proletariat today is not capable of affirming its revolutionary
nature with its own communist project.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">As long as we remain passive consumers and
spectators of our own miserable lives, as long as we remain "useful idiots",
everything can happen to us. We shouldn't be surprised then if tomorrow
these good citizens start to kill each other for any reason you care to
name! Neighbour against neighbour, workmate against workmate, proletarian
against proletarian.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">The fact, that war is becoming "normal",
and the constant threat terrorizes, threatens not only the proletariat
of the states that are directly involved in the war, but also the proletariat
of the whole world. And capitalism - while it is launching wars - is talking
of peace and humanitarianism. But humanitarian campaigns, aid actions,
etc are only means of blackmailing - and, in passing, make market for tons
of unsaleable products - by which the control over the proletariat is being
strengthened.</font>
<center>
<h2>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">oOo</font></h2></center>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Today Yugoslavia is the most important centre
of war in Europe. There are several reasons for launching the war there,
but one of the most important is that since the middle of the '80s the
proletarians in Yugoslavia opposed a fierce resistance to the austerity
measures of the state. Compared with the beginning of the '90s, the war
has become considerably larger in scale. The NATO has intervened, Hungary
has become a war country; the international capital has attacked the proletarians
of the region. One of the direct reasons for this is the proletarian insurrection
in Albania, which started in 1997. The bourgeoisie hasn't managed to restore
order in Albania since then. Today the bourgeoisie tries to minimise the
treat of revolution: they drive the proletarians into an imperialist war,
setting them nationalist aims. In the fight "Serbs" are incited against
"Albanians" in order to hide that <b>the real fronts are</b> not between
nations, but <b>between the two classes, the bourgeoisie and the proletariat!</b></font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">The UCK (the Kosovo Liberation Army) is also
part of the bourgeois state, just like all confronting fractions. It is
proved by their nationalism, their army conscripted by force, which terrorises
the population exactly the same way as the Serb police does, their concentration
camps (they call them refugee camps), in which the terror guys of the UCK
collect everyone still fit for military service and send them to the front
line, to die.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><b>We, communists are against all sides</b>,
against the Serbs and the Albanians, against the NATO and the whole "international
community", against all states, against every bourgeois fraction.
<b>We
have no homeland! To be a patriot is to be a murderer!</b></font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Hungary has become a front-line country.</font>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">We can expect:</font>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">- the escalation of the war - since the
mobilisation of reservists, the preparation of the civil defence guard,
etc. have already started</font>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">- stabilisation of war conditions</font>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">- increasing nationalist incites, spreading
of irredentism (today Vojvodina, tomorrow Transylvania, Slovakia, Carpathian-Ukraine...)</font>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">- price rises, austerity measures because
of the war</font>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">- increasing surveillance over the proletariat,
intensification of the official (police, security guards) and unofficial
(fascist gangs) state terror.</font>
<p><b><font face="Comic Sans MS">FIGHT AGAINST WAR = FIGHT AGAINST CAPITALISM!!!</font></b>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">We're not powerless: we are rich in the historical
experience of our class, we must reappropriate the collective memory of
our struggles; this provides us with the classist framework for our own
activities and saves us having to reproduce the same mistakes again and
again. We also know that our struggle carries real perspectives, from life
itself. Looking ahead, we want to destroy non-life, our misery, exploitation!</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">In this fight we can only count on our own
strength, on the power of the proletariat. We, first of all, attack the
bourgeois fraction which we are directly confronted with, we fight against
"our own bourgeoisie". Internationalism doesn't mean to "do something for
proletarians everywhere"; but it means to be the part of the same struggle,
to assert here as everywhere the community of interests and of struggle
that we share with our class brothers and sisters in Serbia, in Kosovo
and everywhere in the world. Revolutionary defeatism = the struggle for
the defeat of "one's own bourgeoisie" - against the whole bourgeois order!</font>
<p><b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Proletarian brother! Don't let the capital
fool you! Organise against capitalism! Sabotage production! Desert the
army! Turn your arm against the real enemy!</font></b>
