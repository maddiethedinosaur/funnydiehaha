<h2>
<font face="Bookman Old Style">Proletarians, let’s refuse to submit to
the anti-terrorist campaign of the state!</font></h2></center>

<center>
<h1>
<font face="Bookman Old Style">Anti-terrorism is state’s terrorism!</font></h1></center>
<font face="Bookman Old Style">The capitalist terrorism against the humanity
speeds up everywhere in the world. The raising of foodstuffs price, the
massive layoffs and the cut in social allowances, following the current
capitalist crisis, throw hundreds of millions of proletarians out into
the street and deprive them of the most elementary means of survival.</font>
<center>
<h2>
<font face="Bookman Old Style">First and foremost it’s deprivation of our
means of life by capital that is terrorist!</font></h2></center>
<b><font face="Bookman Old Style">To stand up for themselves against the
exponential worsening of survival conditions, proletarians take to the
street and confront the state in dozens of countries all over the world,
and right now in Greece, Italy, and Spain...</font></b>
<p><font face="Bookman Old Style">The states, their laws and their police
harshly suppress any proletarian action (picket line, traffic blockade,
sabotage, demonstration, etc.) that hinders sacrosanct “free movement of
labour, right to work, to sell, and to buy...”. Struggling proletarians
are systematically accused by the state “to take innocent victims hostage”
(i.e. citizens who submit to the bourgeois law and order), to intimidate
them, and to terrorize them.</font>
<p><font face="Bookman Old Style">It is actually the bourgeoisie that feels
terrorized by the fact that merchant property and freedom are being called
into question, and this is the reason why it tends to broaden its definition
of “terrorism” to any action that breaks with the democratic order. It
means thus at the same time:</font>
<blockquote>
<li>
<font face="Bookman Old Style">Hiding the fundamentally terrorist nature
of its domination while exclusively putting terrorism into the same category
as the proletariat’s violent reactions, while deliberately confusing those
reactions that stand in a class perspective and those that various containments
lead astray towards aclassist, reformist, religious, national liberation
purposes;</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Bookman Old Style">Consolidating its legal, juridical and ideological
arsenal of repression against any protest movement targeting the merchant
order;</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Bookman Old Style">Imposing among the exploited the ideological
division between “innocents” and “culprits”, between “honest citizens”
and “terrorist barbarians”;</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Bookman Old Style">Finally isolating proletarians who break
with Social Democrat pacifism and pushing their class brothers and sisters
to denounce and dissociate.</font></li>
</blockquote>

<center>
<h2>
<font face="Bookman Old Style">It is essential to affirm against these
bourgeois manoeuvres that:</font></h2></center>

<blockquote>
<li>
<font face="Bookman Old Style">First and foremost what is terrorist it’s
the very bases of the democratic system of property and liberty, the legal
rules protecting this latter!</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Bookman Old Style">Any compromise to the anti-terrorist campaign
of the state directly means collaborating to the repression of any protest
against capital’s daily terrorism against the humanity!</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Bookman Old Style">The proletarians repressed in the name of
anti-terrorism
<b>are our fellow proletarians!</b></font></li>
