<h1>
<font face="Arial Black">“Hunger riots” are struggles of the proletariat!</font></h1></center>
<font face="Arial Black">Everywhere in the world the contradiction between
the human needs and the needs of Capital, of profit, is always more striking.
Grim murderous merry-go-round of stock exchanges and markets, cynical and
murderous calendar of adjustment structural plans, all this implies for
our class always more misery, deprivation, daily and generalized poisoning.
Capital’s catastrophe speeds up and it's always our class that picks up
the tab!</font>
<center>
<h2>
<font face="Arial Black">Capital deprived us of anything to force us to
work</font></h2></center>

<center>
<h2>
<font face="Arial Black">When it doesn’t need our labour force anymore,
it lets us die</font></h2></center>

<center>
<h2>
<font face="Arial Black">Capital kills and doesn’t have anything else to
offer</font></h2></center>
<font face="Arial Black">But the proletariat doesn’t take the increasing
brutality of these attacks against its survival conditions without reacting.
These last weeks, in dozens of countries all over the world, our class
took to the streets, reappropriating something to eat in order not to die.</font>
<p><font face="Arial Black">Faced with this human reaction social democracy
deplores lootings and revolts “without prospects”. In the name of saving
the planet it advocates austerity, abnegation and submission. Denouncing
this or that “pernicious effect of the system”, brandishing the mystification
of “world overpopulation”, it feeds us again with its wild imaginings of
accounting reforms supposed to regulate profit and to humanize the capitalist
barbarity.</font>
<p><font face="Arial Black">Everywhere in the world proletarians nowadays
get hammered through generalized attack against “purchasing power”. Yet,
resignation through social democratic acceptance of the “lesser evil” globally
still prevails today: the worst is and will always be elsewhere, farther,
in the “third world”, by “the poorest”, “the most exploited”...</font>
<p><font face="Arial Black">Bourgeoisie can still take the liberty of maintaining
the struggles of our class in isolation and restore its social peace while
murdering with impunity <b>our class brothers striking for their most elementary
needs</b>. And this happens with the necessary support of these useful
idiots, these docile citizens who vote and sort out their household waste,
these sloppy spectators sitting before their television and who will maybe
shed tears over “violence and hunger in the world” between two elections
or sports results.</font>
<center>
<h2>
<font face="Arial Black">Dying or struggling, there is no other alternative
for the proletariat</font></h2></center>

<center>
<h2>
<font face="Arial Black">Let’s support our struggling class brothers, let’s
fight everywhere against exploitation</font></h2></center>

<center>
<h2>
<font face="Arial Black">Hunger riots and suburbs riots... these struggles
are ours</font></h2></center>

<center>
<h2>
<font face="Arial Black">Our enemy is everywhere the same</font></h2></center>
