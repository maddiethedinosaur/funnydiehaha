<font face="Comic Sans MS">Two years of uninterrupted massacres in Yugoslavia
show us the reality of this war:</font>
<ul>
<li>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the undifferentiated killings of proletarians,
as is shown for instance by the discovery of mass graves where the bodies
of "Serbs", "Croats", "Bosnians"... have been buried together;</font></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the internment of thousands of prisoners of
war in numerous camps spread over the whole territory of former Yugoslavia;</font></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the floods of refugees who try to escape the
massacres by taking to the roads in the vain hope of finding a haven somewhere
else;</font></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the forcible sending of war refugees to the
battle fields... even those from their "own side". Thousands of refugees
in Croatia (in the camps of Karlovac and elsewhere), have been "selected"
and sent back to fight on the front lines. In Belgrade as well, refugees
from Croatia have been sent back to the front lines;</font></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and the war also means shortages, rationing,
inflation, impoverishment, unemployment,... All the States cleverly use
the war situation so as to liquidate the less productive sectors of industry
and in order to impose new sacrifices on proletarians. The war is not only
on the battle fields; it is everywhere!</font></li>
</ul>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is reality, this is what we submit to day
after day, this is what we suffer in our flesh and blood, this is our misery!</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">This reality, with the cynical unfolding
of bombings, massacres and persecutions shows evidently that this war is
against the proletariat, against its interests and against its struggle.
This war is a new episode in the already endless list of attacks by the
worldwide capitalist State against the proletariat. This nth war is nothing
but a genuine product of the capitalist world of exploitation.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">And besides this reality which is impossible
to ignore, there is also the discourse, the bullshit, the spectacle. Because
each time capitalism
<b>openly</b> shows its true nature, like today in
former Yugoslavia, all the predominant myths have a single common denominator
- the claim that capitalist horror is ccaused by phenomena allegedly external
to the development of this society. The aim is to conceal reality, to keep
the real game hidden so as to subjugate proletarians even more and to make
them accept the unceasing sacrifices that this society feeds on. The aim
is to hide the fact that capitalist society means nothing but war, famine
and misery. This is why politicos and other journalists blame "incompetent
leaders" or "dictators", "lack of development", "religious" or "ethnic"
causes, "lack of democracy"... as we already said: bullshit, spectacle.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">One of the real reasons for the launching
of war in Yugoslavia is the need for the State to beat the proletariat,
to subjugate it, to scatter it and to defeat its struggles. During the
five years that preceded the outbreak of war, our class brothers and sisters
in Yugoslavia, through their struggles, opposed a fierce resistance to
the anti-worker measures that the State took in the face of the crisis
that violently shakes capitalist society, here as everywhere else.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">In the international context of crisis, the
exacerbation of antagonisms between capitalist sharks becomes inevitable,
and the worsening of inter-imperialist tension, the multiplication of centres
of war as the "natural" ground where these antagonisms explode into the
open - independently of the will of the various bourgeois factions - makes
up our daily reality. War is going on <b>here and now</b>, and not only
elsewhere or later on. Each capitalist faction permanently prepares for
war, makes war. For instance by imposing social peace "at home" and by
constantly introducing new attacks (redundancies, cuts in wages and benefits,
speed-ups, discipline...) against our conditions of life and struggle.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">This war in Yugoslavia is another step towards
more generalised war through the "acceptance" (an "acceptance" that is
being imposed by terror and permanent blackmail!) by all of war as the
"natural" perspective for society in crisis. Here we refer to the proletarians
in Europe and elsewhere who passively watch the progression of these massacres
on their television screens. Since the crisis is "natural", so unemployment,
misery, all kind of sacrifices also become "natural". You no longer protest,
you start to accept ("things could be worse"!), you sacrifice yourself.
And with this same logic, you will soon be ready to leave for the front!</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">This is not surprising since the majority
of proletarians today, especially in Europe, remain prisoners of patriotism
and other bourgeois ideological frameworks, prisoners of "pacifism", "anti-imperialism"
or still "anti-fascism". This is not surprising either when we can see
that the international proletariat today is not capable of affirming its
revolutionary nature with its own communist project.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">As long as we remain passive consumers and
spectators of our own miserable lives, as long as we remain "useful idiots",
everything can happen to us. We shouldn't be surprised then if tomorrow
these good citizens start to kill each other for any reason you care to
name! Neighbour against neighbour, workmate against workmate, proletarian
against proletarian.</font>
<center>
<h2>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">oOo</font></h2></center>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If we've emphasised here the tragic aspects
of war in former Yugoslavia, it is not to weep over this situation, nor
to try to move anybody about these sufferings or to rouse any indignation!
Against humanism, against hypocritical lamentations, we want to shout that
any opposition, any struggle against capitalist war can only become real
on the condition of waging it <b>here and now</b>, starting from now, and
not "later on, if..."; at the same time, it can only become real if we
attack all bourgeois factions (and denounce all their ideologies!) and
not such or such bourgeois politics in particular, pretending it to be
worse than the others.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">We are against all sides, against the Croat,
Serb, Bosnian, Slovenian, Kosovar, against the "international community"
(which is only another word for the gang of terrorist States that put us
down and exploit us day after day!), French, American, Russian, German,
Italian, British, Egyptian, Iranian,... whatever! We have no homeland!
To be a patriot means to be a murderer!</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">And first of all we attack the bourgeois
faction that directly faces us because in the struggle against "our own
bourgeoisie", we practically assert our internationalism, the identity
of interest and of struggle that we have in common with proletarians in
Yugoslavia and elsewhere. Our internationalism does not mean "to do something
for proletarians elsewhere", but it means to be part of the same struggle,
to assert here as everywhere the community of interests and of struggle
that we share with our class brothers and sisters everywhere. Revolutionary
defeatism = to struggle for the defeat of "one's own bourgeoisie"!</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">The importance of this last point becomes
even more clear when we notice the practical connivance (notwithstanding
of course their speeches full of good intentions) between all the various
factions of the worldwide capitalist State. Their various policies <b>objectively</b>
end up in the generalised massacres of our fellow proletarians.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">The role of the imperialist powers is clear,
they are directly involved in the war in Yugoslavia: all bourgeois factions
work perfectly together for the continuation of the massacres. Besides
the role they played in the launching of the conflict by sanctioning the
breaking up of Yugoslavia's national unity through their recognition of
the independence of Slovenia and Croatia; besides the huge profits that
they make, just like in any war, by selling arms; besides the usefulness
of this war as a field for large-scale experiments: besides the hypocritical
international blockade that above all cements national unity around the
clique of governing bastards in Serbia itself; besides the very useful
propaganda that this war allows them to make "at home", in defence of "the
values of the free world", against "human madness",... we do not forget
that these States also intervene <b>directly</b> (they <b>massacre!</b>),
through the actions of NATO and the UN, under the hypocritical pretext
of peace-keeping operations. If you want to make war, talk of peace! Like
during the Gulf war!</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">We do not fight for "peace", we are not pacifists!
Capitalist war and peace cannot be separated, and our struggle is antagonistic
to both! In this anaesthetized society, the height of radicalism today
is to "call for" the intervention of the UN to restore peace. There are
none so blind as those who will not see.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Down with the UN, down with the "angel-faced"
killers! <b>They are not neutral, they are our enemies</b> and they deserve
to be treated as such!</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">The humanitarian campaigns are nothing but
a means of blackmail to reinforce the control over proletarians; moreover,
it is in the name of peace, in the name of the peace agreements, in the
name of the UN, that today proletarians in Bosnia-Hercegovina are forced
to hand over their arms and to wait passively, like beasts, the hour of
death when they'll be sent of to the abattoirs of the battlefields.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">The peace treaties are nothing else but the
sanctioning by the "international community" of what is going on on the
battle fields. And what is going on, is nothing but deportations, malnutrition
and famine, epidemics, systematic rapes,... in short, the eruption of State
terror, and the UN is completely bound up with this, exactly as are the
NGOs (as the president of M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res declared
recently, when he admitted that the activities of his organisation made
the campaigns of "ethnic cleansing" easier.) The NGOs are just puppets
of the generals.</font>
<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">Communist action against capitalist war and
peace !</font></u></h2>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The State represses all those who oppose sacrifices,
social peace and respect for national interests... i.e. the rebels, the
insubordinate and the agitators. And this is exactly what is happening,
on a large scale, in former Yugoslavia, in all its ex-republics: the open
and direct repression of all refractory elements. The state of war, the
military polarisation of society allow for the suppression, with complete
impunity, of all those who do not subscribe to patriotic and ideological
values... that are being branded by both sides. Troublemakers are simply
eliminated by the State.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">The State always persecutes social agitators,
all those who're opposed to it, to it's social peace and it's patriotic
duty. It knows that it's domination of society is precarious since it bases
itself essentially on the capacity to divide proletarians, to keep them
locked up within bourgeois polarisations (this shows the importance of
ideological mystifications), and to repress without mercy any manifestation
of struggle against exploitation and against the State. Control of the
State over society is not without its problems. In Belgrade for instance,
in March '91, a demo organised by the "legal opposition" deviated from
its initial objectives into classist clashes with the forces of order.
About 100,000 proletarians, screaming "Milosevic = Saddam: send them to
the desert!" headed for the city centre. A fraction of them, the most militant,
attacked stores and banks, burning the "Serbian" and "Yugoslavian" national
flags. The army had to intervene. It took them four days to re-establish
law and order, to put down the proletarian defeatist actions.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">We're not powerless: we are rich in the historical
experience of our class, we reappropriate the collective memory of our
struggles; this provides us with the classist framework for our own activities
and saves us having to reproduce the same mistakes again and again. We
also know that our struggle carries real perspectives, from life itself.
Looking ahead, we want to destroy non-life, our misery, exploitation! This
gives us our audacity!</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Without having any illusions, given our scattered
and isolated state, given the dominant atmosphere of sectarianism and suspicion
towards all attempts to organise militancy and towards all attempts to
bring to life a centralised direction in revolutionary activity, we can
only aim at taking on the minimum level of the perspectives of struggle
(denunciation of all nationalists, of the UN and all imperialist powers,
circulation of information, direct support to all internationalist comrades,
clarification and assumption of the aims and means of communist struggle...).
We aim to achieve this in common with other comrades who act on the basis
of internationalist communist activity against capitalist war and peace.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">The writing and circulation, in different
languages, of this manifesto allows us to centralise our activities, to
get in touch with other revolutionaries, to strengthen the camp of those
who defend with us the same internationalist perspectives, to express the
needs of all proletarians who revolt against war and misery, and to reinforce,
by the clarity of our perspectives for struggle and through our determination,
the impact of our refusal.</font>
