<font face="Arial Black">CPE-CNE, CDI-CDD, RMI-RMA...</font></h1></center>

<h2>
<font face="Arial Black">Behind these initials, the same and disgusting
capitalistic reality:</font></h2></center>

<center>
<h1>
<font face="Arial Black">Worse Conditions of EXPLOITATION! (*)</font></h1></center>

<p><br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Incredible class <b>VIOLENCE</b> forcing
proletarians to sell themselves to the bosses in order to quite simply
survive.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Bourgeois <b>VIOLENCE</b> that can be summed
up in a general deterioration of all our surviving conditions: always more
bloody awful and less paid jobs, always more harmful food, always more
polluted air, still more fatal diseases...</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Still capitalistic <b>VIOLENCE</b> with
the almost permanent war for more than the half of the population of the
planet.</font>
<center>
<h2>
<font face="Arial Black">AND WHAT'S THE REACTION AGAINST ALL THIS?</font></h2></center>

<ul>
<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Marching like sheeps behind those who are
breaking our struggles, negotiating our misery with our exploiters and
sending us back at work or at school: the UNIONS!</font></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Locking oneself into stupidity of assemblyism,
real chatterbox and not real place to organize the struggle; in this way
Dijon EGM gathered (March 19th-20th) during 17 HOURS to decide on a two-day
"mobilization"!</font></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Swallowing all kinds of politicians' promises
who sell us again the miracle of alternation in order to bury our struggles
while going to the polls.</font></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Getting catch out in futile confrontations
<u>where
the bourgeois police are waiting for us</u> and are therefore the strongest.</font></li>
</ul>

<center>
<h2>
<font face="Arial Black">Proletarian, if you want to be really victorious,
you need to take to the streets otherwise.</font></h2></center>

<p><br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><b>Let's REFUSE</b> to march and walk
the streets in these carnivalesque processions where the only thing emerging
is to feel powerless.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><b>Let's ORGANIZE</b> demonstrations outside
and against the unions, parties,... Let them become real struggle centres!</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><b>Let's BREAK</b> democratic idiocy of
"supreme and massive" EGM, let's spit on "permanently elected and removable
delegates"... Let's break fetishism of the majority. That's enough talk
and vote, the time has come for action.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><b>Let's ATTACK</b> the bourgeoisie <u>where
it doesn't wait for us</u>. The state wants to assume the monopoly of violence:
let's break it! Let's oppose proletarian violence towards violence of the
state.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><b>Let's SPREAD</b> the movement to all
sectors of our class: general strike outside and against union farce, production
sabotage. Let's organize flying pickets, let's stop movement of goods at
crossroads, stations, airports...</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><b>Let's STRANGLE</b> the dictatorship
of the economy as our class brothers did lately all over the world (Bolivia,
Algeria, Argentina, Iraq, etc.).</font>
<center>
<h2>
<font face="Arial Black">Down with labor! Down with exploitation! Down
with capitalism!</font></h2></center>

initials CPE, which officially means "Contrat Premi&egrave;re Embauche"
