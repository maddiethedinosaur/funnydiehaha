<font face="Bookman Old Style"><font size=+4>Haiti: save capital’s property
from the wreckage, and leave the proletarians to croak!</font></font></h1></center>
<font face="Bookman Old Style">Barricades made out of bodies. This is what
proletarians of Port-au-Prince erected across the streets eight days after
the earthquake. It is said that “<i>they protest against glaring lack of
emergency relief</i>”. How not to see, beyond this obviousness that media
prefer to hold on to, what these proletarians surviving on borrowed time
proclaim to the face of this society, of its dominant class, but also to
all of its decent citizens: <i>these are your deaths, they died of the
crowding in which we lived, so little has been done the first days to save
survivors and since then you are letting us dying in this gigantic mass
grave</i>. Indeed, it is not necessary to explain to proletarians of Haiti
that the States mobilizing today on the island don’t give a fuck about
their fate. As we regularly and strongly denounce in our press, soldiers
and humanitarian workers are more than ever both faces of the same state
programme aiming at breaking on the spot all class solidarity, all direct
actions for survival. In a region historically full of uprisings, proletarians
even in “normal” times are in a good position to grasp for which camp the
humanitarian sector (independently from individual <i>good intentions</i>)
and all the more the United Nations works: the camp of keeping the peace,
the social peace, the maintenance of law and order, or also the famous
“development”, that is to say the development of profit and exploitation
by the destruction of all autonomous practice of survival and struggle
of our class. In fact, all these fundamentally capitalistic concerns to
frame, to domesticate, to subject to civilization, are <i>inseparable</i>
from brutal repression of struggles by weapons and torture. There are not
a lot of proletarians who would cry for the deaths from “Minustah”, the
UN mission in Haiti.</font>
<p><font face="Bookman Old Style">Facing the disaster provoked by such
earthquake in the heart of such merely capitalistic concentration of misery
(we emphasize), and while bourgeoisie sheds crocodile tears over what it
likes to call a “humanitarian crisis”, the role of its “charitable” agents
has been only confirmed. An American aircraft carrier is berthed just in
front of Haiti, civilian and military planes are incessantly coming and
going on the only operational runway of the airport (that got very quickly
under control of the US Army),… but it is not to save proletarians of Haiti
that all this abundance of means was mobilized for. There is indeed emergency
relief… but for capital: to restore the state, to defend private property,
to ensure supplying and logistics of the intervention force (including
journalists) and the strategic institutions (UN, embassies,…), to save
its own nationals (including debris of luxury hotels), and above all to
redeploy a lasting international military presence, with the essential
aim not to let revolted proletarians getting organized against their situation,
which is the fruit of the yesterday and nowadays international bourgeois
hate against them. When food and water will arrive to the gates of destroyed
popular districts (and after ten days this is not yet the case!), the miserly
distribution will be as always subject to docility and submissiveness of
the people who will get these supplies.</font>
<p><font face="Bookman Old Style">While they rescue on TV several survivors
from the wreckage and they try to convince us that “every social stratum”
is touched without distinction, pictures of proletarians armed with machetes
and “laying down the law in the streets” are constantly broadcast on the
televisions all over the world. International media and leftist press are
in their common action of dividing our class once again in an arrogant
connivance to feed us with their racist clich&eacute;s according to which
hordes of Negroid destitute facing the disintegration of the State reverted
greedily to their frightening natural state, the cannibalistic war of each
against the others. They are described as propelled once by “despair”,
another time by “cupidity”, organized in gangs which spread terror to “appropriate”
foodstuffs and whose ranks certainly increased by the 6,000 prisoners who
had escape under cover of the earthquake. Disgusted by this surging wave
of bestiality, we are urged to applaud to the salutary deployment of the
so-called “security” forces, all this to make us paying our guilty financial
contribution into bank accounts displayed on the screen of television “solidarity”
shows.</font>
<p><font face="Bookman Old Style">Behind these hackneyed journalistic phrases
of “increasing number of looting scenes” is (badly) hidden the climax of
capitalistic cynicism, a considerable degree of advances made in the field
of inhumanity by the last –and the most “civilized”- of the class societies:
whereas “all is disrupted” and the state is supposed to have vanished into
the earthquake, armed cops and soldiers patrol amidst all these rubble
and piles of dead bodies in a state of decomposition to prevent (with real
bullets) the starving and thirsty proletarians to search in debris of stores
in quest of what would allow them and their children not to croak like
dogs! Well, that is the prosaic reality of the struggle against the vile
gangs of looters! That is what recalls tremendously the situation in New
Orleans after passing of hurricane Katrina in the summer 2005.</font>
<p><font face="Bookman Old Style">And as for Louisiana, when the bourgeoisie
and its commentators emotionally and obscenely avidly evoke perspectives
of “reconstruction”, we cannot doubt that the investments to grant, motivated
by the purest selflessness, will zealously follow plans for social cleansing,
plans which are developed in the worldwide gendarmerie headquarters.</font>
<p><font face="Bookman Old Style">So, proletarians return these pitiful
bastards’ kindness: come yourselves to clear these barricades of dead bodies
erected against the murderous hypocrisy of your society, they are not the
result of “<i>the Providence’s injustice</i>” or “<i>the nature</i>” but
rather and precisely of this society!</font>
