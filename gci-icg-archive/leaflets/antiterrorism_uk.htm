<h1>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Antiterrorism = development of terror against
our struggles</font></h1></center>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The war in Afghanistan and its trail of antiterrorist
measures in every country, mark a step in the development of the general
war against the proletariat!</font>
<ul>
<li>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Massive bombings or "surgical strikes", massacres
on a large scale or "collateral damage",... while putting the planet to
fire and sword, the bourgeois defend the peace of their world of misery
through terror.</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Special courts, military decrees, "administrative
internments", unlimited detentions, trials in camera,... they sharpen their
weapons to condemn all proletarian suspected to break the public order,
the national security, to break the social peace, the dictatorship of the
economy.</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Increase in the number of the international
exchanges of information, international arrest warrants,... Lists are circulating
with the names of groups or individuals to destroy,... at this day, in
the USA, 5000 people are aimed at.</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Antiterrorism is used as a pretext to violently
accelerate the spiral: decreases of wages, layoffs, starvation, armament,...
In the air, road transport,... the postal services, the chemistry, insurances,...
layoffs are showered, by hundreds of thousand, in the USA, in Europe, in
Asia,... On the other hand, in the sectors of repression (armament, electronic
surveillance, cops,...) they invest and hire!</font></li>
</ul>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Facing the proletarian struggles that "threaten"
to develop all States support themselves and unite.</font>
<center>
<h3>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Antiterrorism is the monopoly of weapons in
the hands of the State against our struggles!</font></h3></center>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's open our eyes and let's recognize that
the war in Afghanistan, in Yugoslavia, in Iraq,... is a war against our
own struggles!</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's open our eyes and let's recognize that
the struggles of our class brothers in Algeria, in Syria, in Lebanon, in
Iran, in Indonesia,... are our own struggles!</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">To submit to the antiterrorist campaigns,
it is accepting the brutal reduction of wages over there as here and it
is <b>contributing to the repression</b> of our comrades over there as
here.</font>
<center>
<h3>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Our struggle is here and now against what makes
of us slaves of labour, of shortage, of money, of capital.</font></h3></center>

<center>
<h3>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">THE ENEMY IS IN OUR OWN COUNTRY THIS IS OUR
OWN BOURGEOISIE!</font></h3></center>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">While the capital claims to be socialist or
liberal, warmongering or pacifist, polluting or biodegradable, from the
South or from the North,... it is always dictatorship of money, of the
rate of profit, and, from summits to antisummits, from referendum to elections,
it puts on stage the bourgeois who will determine what fate has in store
for us.</font>
<center>
<h3>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's organize beyond the borders, outside and
against the summits and antisummits and any other structure of the bourgeois
State!</font></h3></center>

<center>
<h2>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The only alternative is THE WORLDWIDE REVOLUTION!</font></h2></center>
