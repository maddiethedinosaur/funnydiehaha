During more than 10 weeks, the air force of the NATO's allied nations bombed
Yugoslavia, every day, every night. Once again, the bourgeoisie tried to
sell us this war (as it made with the Gulf war) as a "clean war", with
"surgical strikes" without flaw, as a war that must work to impose peace
in the Balkans. Once again, the bourgeois medias justified us this war
in the name of humanitarian aid towards the "oppressed people", in the
name of the right to interfere, whereas more and more proletarians were
killed during the bombings, victims of the so-called "collateral damages".
But we very well know what's the sense in their "clean" and "humanitarian"
wars...
<p>Since the capitalist mode of production exists and therefore rules the
whole planet, all wars are bourgeois, capitalist; beyond the ideologies
for which the capital pretends to make them, all wars are wars against
the proletariat, they are counterrevolutionary wars.
<p>Beyond the inter-imperialist rivalries, the reason for bourgeois war
is always the depreciation, the fall of the profit rate leading to a generalized
overproduction of commodities and therefore also an excess of labor force.
Even if for its consciousness, it is especially the matter about destroying
the enemy, the main goal for the yesterday and nowadays bourgeoisie is
still the same: the massive destruction of men that the capitalism turned
into today excess commodities. Only communism will suppress wars.
<p>To wage its wars, the bourgeoisie must eliminate the proletariat as
a class, that is to say as an active strength, as a party, to break it
up into the people, to then recruit these citizens among other citizens
behind any flag hiding the hideous face of capitalism, the flag of antifascism
or fascism, the progressive or reactionary one, democrat or totalitarianist,
the flag of the conquest of a vital space or the national liberation, of
the defense of civilized West or anticolonialism,... It is always in the
name of peace, freedom, democracy, socialism,... that cadavers heap up,
that civilians as military are mutilated with cluster bombs, that they
die in concentration camps.
<p>As workers' answer to the bourgeois attacks, internationalism means
starting from today to <u>break the social peace</u>, the peace of capital,
to develop our struggles where we stand, against our direct exploiters
<u>everywhere
in the world</u>. We prepare our solution to the bourgeois crisis: the
<u>worldwide
communist revolution</u>, while answering a stroke for a stroke to the
deteriorations of our living conditions. It is the only way to fight against
the bourgeois solution that is the generalized war.
<p>The imperialist war triggering off, even a generalized one, doesn't
necessarily mean the definitive crushing of the proletariat. Indeed, historically,
if the war means in a first time a relative crushing, it can then dialectically
determine a resumption all the more stronger because it has exposed the
contradictions and the barbarity immanent to the capitalist system. For
the revolutionary workers, the struggle against war means directly the
<u>revolutionary
defeatism</u>.
<p>The revolutionary defeatism turns its back on all pacifism even disguised
and radicalized, that is to say not going so far as to give some concrete
and precise orders with a view to encourage and to act violently for the
defeat of "our" camp, of "our" nation, of "our" armies. The proletarian
defeatism means, besides the obvious <u>defeatist propaganda</u>:
<ul>
<li>
the organization of <u>sabotaging</u> the economy, the production, the
armaments convoys,... all the nationalist consensus;</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
the organization of all action aiming to <u>undermine</u> the state of
mind just as well the dispatching of proletarians to slaughter;</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
the organization of the most massive <u>desertion</u>;</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
the encouragement to fraternize, to mutiny, to turn the guns against "our"
officers,...</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
the most determined and <u>offensive</u> action with a view to turn the
imperialist war into <u>civil war for communism</u>.</li>
</ul>
Obviously, the revolutionary defeatism can't be conceived in only one camp.
The communist instructions of sabotage depend of the international nature
of the working class and are therefore aimed to the proletariat all over
the world. The proletarian defeatism means the all-out struggle against
"our bourgeoisie" and that, in all camps, in all countries.
<p>May 19th, following demonstrations against the war, <u>against both
camps</u> in Krusevac and Aleksandrovac (in Serbia), mutinies broke out
on the front in Kosovo in some reservists' units of the Serbian army, confirming
that even in the worst of the counterrevolutionary situations, our class
keeps on being the only living alternative to the capitalist horror. Since
early of May, many demonstrations had already taken place and the movement
spread then to other cities. The information which we have obtained from
that war zone is very fragmentary but we can nevertheless give a glimpse
of the strength of the proletariat, at any rate the subversive character
which it contains and the social contradiction which it carries and which
undermines all institutions of the bourgeoisie.
<p>These movements reveal the profound social fractures which developed
as a war continues. Here, it is clear that the sacred union is blown apart.
All the "appeals for calm and reason" are in vain. From that moment the
bourgeoisie imposes a prudent silence which says much about their fears
of stoking the fires of class struggle. The bourgeoisie tries to hide the
spectre which haunts them, their terror at seeing proletarians taking up
their real arms, class against class, against this nightmare.
<p>If the proletariat wants to definitively get rid of the butchery which
massacres it, the one and only solution is the <u>generalisation in acts
of revolutionary defeatism</u>. The development of struggle has its own
requirements: it must break social cohesion not only in the units of the
army but in the whole of society. For this it needs to finish once and
for all with nationalism in affirming loud and clear that proletarians
have no interest in this war, nor in this dying world. We call for <u>only
one war</u>, that which is against our exploiters, whether they are Serbs,
Kosovars, Americans, Russians or whatever.
<p>Despite the pitiless critique that we must direct against the weaknesses
and expressed limits of these movements and other mutinies that will explode
inevitably, communist militants shed light on such acts that show us that
defeatist minorities are alive and well. Such actions express the point
of view of the whole of our class. Tomorrow revolutionary defeatist mutinies
will make the qualitative leap which involves the liaison and organisation
of the struggle against the war <u>with their class brothers</u> on the
other side of the vile frontiers imposed on us by Capital.
<p>But already today these acts of resistance prove to us that the proletariat
is never completely ready to be massacred in some new capitalist butchery
without turning a hair. Nor to accept sacrifices, austerity, misery, death...
<p>We're not powerless: we are rich in the historical experience of our
class, we reappropriate the collective memory of our struggles; this provides
us with the classist framework for our own activities and saves us having
to reproduce the same mistakes again and again. We also know that our struggle
carries real perspectives, from life itself. Looking ahead, we want to
destroy non-life, our misery, exploitation!
<p>Without having any illusions, given our scattered and isolated state,
given the dominant atmosphere of sectarianism and suspicion towards all
attempts to organise militancy and towards all attempts to bring to life
a centralised direction in revolutionary activity, we can only aim at taking
on the minimum level of the perspectives of struggle (denunciation of all
nationalists, of the NATO, of the UNO and all imperialist powers, circulation
of information, direct support to all internationalist comrades, clarification
and assumption of the aims and means of communist struggle...). We aim
to achieve this in common with other comrades who act on the basis of internationalist
communist activity against capitalist war and peace.
<p>The writing and international circulation of this text allows us to
centralise our activities, to get in touch with other revolutionaries,
to strengthen the camp of those who defend with us the same internationalist
perspectives, to express the needs of all proletarians who revolt against
war and misery, and to reinforce, by the clarity of our perspectives for
struggle and through our determination, the impact of our refusal.
