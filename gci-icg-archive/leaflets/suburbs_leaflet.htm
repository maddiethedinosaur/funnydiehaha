<font face="Comic Sans MS">(The Commune of Paris, 1871)</font></h2></center>

<center><font face="Comic Sans MS">More than one century ago, whereas the
bourgeoisie already called proletarians "the rabble", these ones answered
while asserting through insurrection their own contempt for this society
that only has misery to offer them.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Today, the capitalistic society herds us
and packs us into deprived and garbage estates where brutal misery and
boredom rule supreme. Once the unrest began, the state wanted to turn them
into a matter of "immigrants" and as ever denounced the "rabble", the "riffraff".
Against this division the struggle of our class answered:</font></center>

<h1>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+4>"Is this the riffraff? Well I'm
taking part!" (*)</font></font></h1></center>

<center>
<h2>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Today, in several cities all over the world,
proletarians identify with social unrest in deprived estates of 300 districts
in France!</font></h2></center>

<center><font face="Comic Sans MS">Attacks on town halls, banks, post offices,
law courts, social security centres, jobcentres (ANPE), schools, sports
halls, police stations, warehouses, stores, urban transports, journalists,
etc.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Proletarian, yes indeed, private property,
commodity and the institutions that defend them are responsible for our
misery and exploitation, for murders and "police blunders", for jail and
everyday deportations... The state does everything to trap us in neighbourhoods,
factories, schools: distances, transportation, cops, social workers and
other community policemen, mindless state through education and sport,
etc.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Proletarian, break through these quarantine
lines, get out of the suburbs! Look at Argentina: they got out of their
different neighbourhoods to hold up the traffic, paralyzing the economy
and organizing the riposte towards repression.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Politicians (current or alternative ones),
either right- or left-wingers, journalists and other official lies-tellers,
associations praising citizenship, careerists and crooks of "Suburbs Respect",
imams,... all of them try to make believe that the resignation of such
bastard of minister, the mass involvement in the next elections could change
things... All of them try to buy our obedience to better send us to the
slaughter.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">And you proletarian who has a "steady" job,
you whose it's said that you took "the social ladder", don't forget that
increasing exploitation or unemployment are waiting for you on each floor;
already the CRS [riot police] are waiting for you on the floor of your
future revolt. Don't join today the state in its contempt of "the riffraff",
don't be accomplice of the repression against those who dared to take to
the streets.</font></center>

<center>
<h2>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Against the divisions the state tries to impose
us between youngsters and old folks, between suburbanites and city-dwellers,
between immigrants and people of French origin... Let's answer together:
"Is this the riffraff? Well we're taking part!"</font></h2></center>

<center>
<h2>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's destroy what destroys us! Let's leave
this society only but its ashes.</font></h2></center>

<center>
<h2>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's oppose proletarian violence to violence
of the state! Let's get out of the suburbs, let's get organized to defend
us against the capital and its state.</font></h2></center>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">(*) Untranslatable play on words in French with
"Canaille" and "Racaille" we translated as "Rabble" and "Riffraff": 1/
"Canaille" ("Rabble") is a pejorative term that has been historically used
by the bourgeois to refer to people considered as being insignificant and
dishonest persons, the "populace", the "mob" or the "proletariat in rags".
The song written during the "Commune of Paris" refered to this "rabble"
and proclaimed this identity as a class expression. 2/ "Racaille" ("Riffraff")
is an insulting term, which meaning is: infamous, vile, disgusting, shameful,
rubbish, garbage, scrap, scum, dregs of society, etc. The French Minister
of the Interior, Sarkozy, launched a campaign of repression against the
struggling young proletarians of suburbs, while describing them as "riffraff".</font></h6></center>
