<font face="Comic Sans MS">* <font size=+4>*</font> *</font></h1></center>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Since the capitalist mode of production exists
and therefore rules the whole planet, all wars are bourgeois, capitalist;
beyond the ideologies for which the capital pretends to make them, all
wars are wars against the proletariat, they are counterrevolutionary wars.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Beyond the inter-imperialist rivalries, the
reason for bourgeois war is always the depreciation, the fall of the profit
rate leading to a generalized overproduction of commodities and therefore
also an excess of labor force. Even if for its consciousness, it is especially
the matter about destroying the enemy, the main goal for the yesterday
and nowadays bourgeoisie is still the same: the massive destruction of
men that the capitalism turned into today excess commodities. Only communism
will suppress wars.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">To wage its wars, the bourgeoisie must eliminate
the proletariat as a class, that is to say as an active strength, as a
party, to break it up into the people, to then recruit these citizens among
other citizens behind any flag hiding the hideous face of capitalism, the
flag of antifascism or fascism, the progressive or reactionary one, democrat
or totalitarianist, the flag of the conquest of a vital space or the national
liberation, of the defense of civilized West or anticolonialism,... It
is always in the name of peace, freedom, democracy, socialism,... that
cadavers heap up, that civilians as military are mutilated with cluster
bombs, that they die in concentration camps.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">As workers' answer to the bourgeois attacks,
internationalism means starting from today to <u>break the social peace</u>,
the peace of capital, to develop our struggles where we stand, against
our direct exploiters
<u>everywhere in the world</u>. We prepare our solution
to the bourgeois crisis: the
<u>worldwide communist revolution</u>, while
answering a stroke for a stroke to the deteriorations of our living conditions.
It is the only way to fight against the bourgeois solution that is the
generalized war.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">The imperialist war triggering off, even
a generalized one, doesn't necessarily mean the definitive crushing of
the proletariat. Indeed, historically, if the war means in a first time
a relative crushing, it can then dialectically determine a resumption all
the more stronger because it has exposed the contradictions and the barbarity
immanent to the capitalist system. For the revolutionary workers, the struggle
against war means directly the
<u>revolutionary defeatism</u>.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">The revolutionary defeatism turns its back
on all pacifism even disguised and radicalized, that is to say not going
so far as to give some concrete and precise orders with a view to encourage
and to act violently for the defeat of "our" camp, of "our" nation, of
"our" armies. The proletarian defeatism means, besides the obvious <u>defeatist
propaganda</u>:</font>
<ul>
<li>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the organization of <u>sabotaging</u> the economy,
the production, the armaments convoys,... all the nationalist consensus;</font></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the organization of all action aiming to <u>undermine</u>
the state of mind just as well the dispatching of proletarians to slaughter;</font></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the organization of the most massive <u>desertion</u>;</font></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the encouragement to fraternize, to mutiny,
to turn the guns against "our" officers,...</font></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the most determined and <u>offensive</u> action
with a view to turn the imperialist war into <u>civil war for communism</u>.</font></li>
</ul>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Obviously, the revolutionary defeatism can't
be conceived in only one camp. The communist instructions of sabotage depend
of the international nature of the working class and are therefore aimed
to the proletariat all over the world. The proletarian defeatism means
the all-out struggle against "our bourgeoisie" and that, in all camps,
in all countries.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">If the proletariat wants to definitively
get rid of the butchery which massacres it, the one and only solution is
the <u>generalisation in acts of revolutionary defeatism</u>. The development
of struggle has its own requirements: it must break social cohesion not
only in the units of the army but in the whole of society. For this it
needs to finish once and for all with nationalism in affirming loud and
clear that proletarians have no interest in this war, nor in this dying
world. We call for <u>only one war</u>, that which is against our exploiters,
whether they are Chechnian, Serbs, Kosovars, Americans, Russians or whatever.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Without having any illusions, given our scattered
and isolated state, given the dominant atmosphere of sectarianism and suspicion
towards all attempts to organise militancy and towards all attempts to
bring to life a centralised direction in revolutionary activity, we can
only aim at taking on the minimum level of the perspectives of struggle
(denunciation of all nationalists and all imperialist powers, circulation
of information, direct support to all internationalist comrades, clarification
and assumption of the aims and means of communist struggle...). We aim
to achieve this in common with other comrades who act on the basis of internationalist
communist activity against capitalist war and peace.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">The writing and international circulation
of this text allows us to centralise our activities, to get in touch with
other revolutionaries, to strengthen the camp of those who defend with
us the same internationalist perspectives, to express the needs of all
proletarians who revolt against war and misery, and to reinforce, by the
clarity of our perspectives for struggle and through our determination,
the impact of our refusal.</font>
