<h1>
<u><font face="Bookman Old Style">Who are we?</font></u></h1>
<font face="Bookman Old Style">Rather than being the fruit of the subjective
efforts of a handful of militants, a communist organisation is first and
foremost the result of historical determinations that irresistibly push
the proletariat to constitute itself as a class, to organise itself as
a force, as party, distinct from, and opposed to, all bourgeois parties.
The organisational effort of proletarian minorities, concretised in time
and space by the creation of a communist group, is fundamentally determined
by <b>communism as a movement</b> and by its <b>historical party</b>, i.e.
by the accumulated memory of the whole of the experience of previous struggles,
condensed into a programme. The creation of our group did not escape these
historical determinations.</font>
<p><font face="Bookman Old Style">The Internationalist Communist Group
(ICG) has existed since 1978.</font>
<p><font face="Bookman Old Style">We publish central reviews in English,
French, Spanish, German, Czech, Arabic, Kurdish, Portuguese, Greek, Hungarian
and Russian. We also have texts in Persian, Serbo-Croat and Turkish.</font>
<p><font face="Bookman Old Style">Our group has no national reality. It
is not linked to any country and does not refer to the history of any nation.</font>
<p><font face="Bookman Old Style">Its starting point was the centralisation
of a handful of militants coming from different continents, speaking different
languages, who, from many different experiences of struggles and reflexions
on the defeat of these struggles, were willing to develop and centralise
their common militant activity worldwide together.</font>
<p><font face="Bookman Old Style">With the common political content of
our ruptures, we then chose to formalise our discussions and polemics in
a common organisational structure and define ourselves as the "Internationalist
Communist Group".</font>
<p><font face="Bookman Old Style"><b>"Internationalist"</b> - Well aware
that this term is redundant when used in association with the term "communist",
we characterise ourselves as "internationalists" first of all to stress
that communism, from its very origins and as the movement, excludes country,
nation, national struggle. It signifies that our group is directly organised
on an international level. We did not first constitute our group as a "national
party" and then later open ourselves up to the "international". We started
directly with a central organ, translated into different languages of course,
which always deals with the general interests of the movement, always stresses
the homogeneity of the conditions of exploitation of the proletariat throughout
the world and always puts forward what all these conditions have in common:
the reality of capital and therefore of the proletariat and the conditions
for the realisation of communism.</font>
<p><font face="Bookman Old Style">On another level, the term "internationalist"
also allows us to dissociate ourselves from the many counter-revolutionary
variants disguised as communists (Stalinists, Trotskyists, Maoists, Bordigists,...)
who, by more or less shamefully supporting one or other so-called revolutionary
nation, allow dominant ideology to amalgamate communism with the red-painted
capitalism of the so-called "communist countries".</font>
<p><font face="Bookman Old Style"><b>"Communist"</b> - From time immemorial,
all the bourgeois fractions (Versaillais, fascists, republicans, Stalinists,
liberals,...) have fiercely attacked the spectre constantly haunting the
capitalist world: communism. However, revolutionaries (and our modest grouping
no more than the others) never let themselves be impressed by the flood
of insults and the continuous falsifications formulated throughout history
against communism. Communism - the human community, the collective being,
the classless society - remains the perspective for which we passionately
fight. It is as communists that, facing the capitalist catastrophe, the
dictatorship of profit and money, the constant degradation of our living
conditions, we loudly and clearly demand the abolition of this world of
death, the abolition of private property, of the state, of the exploitation
of man by man. With our comrades throughout history and all over the world,
we once again affirm the necessity for a classless society, without money,
without work, where the free disposal of time and things will constitute
the only terrain for human activity to blossom.</font>
<p><font face="Bookman Old Style"><b>"Group"</b> - By forming a group,
we are once again expressing the historical will of revolutionary proletarians
to organise themselves as a force, to centralise themselves as party. If
we do not claim to be a "party", it is because we know that true constitution
into class (and therefore party) does not depend upon any pompous self-proclamations,
but upon a material qualitative step in the social confrontation against
Capital, State, bourgeoisie. Therefore we consider ourselves to be a faction
of the communist movement; we struggle to exist as an international nucleus
of the centralisation of the proletariat and, as such, participate in the
efforts of vanguard minorities to centralise the community of struggle
that exists throughout the world.</font>
<center>
<h2>
<font face="Bookman Old Style">oOo</font></h2></center>
<font face="Bookman Old Style">It is thus as the Internationalist Communist
Group that we have chosen (for more than twenty years now) to carry on
our international discussions. To reappropriate history - the communist
programme - we have naturally centred our interest and discussions on the
highest moment of rupture that our class has produced up until now: the
international revolutionary wave of struggles of 1917-1923. The numerous
texts published in our reviews which try to draw, without any ideological
a-priori, the lessons of the revolution and counterrevolution in Russia,
Germany, Hungary, America,... during that period are testimony to this
collective work and the passionate debates it gave rise to.</font>
<p><font face="Bookman Old Style">But beyond the centralisation of the
international discussion on 1917-23, our reviews also fight against all
ideologies and take a stand on many questions: the criticism of science,
work, economy, philosophy, texts against the State, reproduction of historical
texts of our class ("our class memory"), texts taking a stand on facts
and current events, on historical polemics,...</font>
<p><font face="Bookman Old Style">Of course, it is impossible to describe
here the real life of our group, the essence of the lessons we draw from
history and even less so the content of our positions. However our reviews,
texts, leaflets,... describe quite well how:</font>
<ul>
<li>
<font face="Bookman Old Style">communism, the classless society, does not
mean the end of history but the beginning of the conscious history of the
human species.</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Bookman Old Style">capitalism, by its universal essence and
by the simplification of class contradictions, creates the conditions for
its own negation, the conditions for communism as well as the social force
that will impose it: the proletariat.</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Bookman Old Style">the revolutionary dictatorship of our class
will abolish the state and will crush any attempts to restore value.</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Bookman Old Style">democracy cannot be reduced to a form of
capitalist domination but constitutes the substance of bourgeois dictatorship.</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Bookman Old Style">the communist movement opposes all bourgeois
parties of the "right" or of the "left", parliamentarianism, trade unionism
and all the forces that maintain social peace.</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Bookman Old Style">the affirmation of communism is the negation
of the whole of present society, negation of private property, of money,...
but also of work, school, family, science,...</font></li>
</ul>
<font face="Bookman Old Style">To give an overview of our contributions,
we recently produced a general summary of the articles published in our
reviews in French and Spanish; this brochure is available on request at
our central addresses (post box or e-mail).</font>
<p><font face="Bookman Old Style">Besides the central reviews that we produce
regularly, in 1989 we also published in Spanish, French and Arabic our
"Theses of programmatical Orientation", the English version coming out
in 1999. These Theses represent an attempt to synthesise the international
discussion and the communist criticism that we have continued from our
very origin. We did not want to elaborate the nth version of some or other
holy text, but to present a "snap-shot", a moment, of the collective permanent
work of programmatical restoration that we have started. Enemies of all
bibles, with this kind of document we are only seeking an increasingly
precise delimitation of the communist practice of rupture from capitalist
society. Our Theses try to express the real movement of abolition of the
established order; they are thus, of course, imperfect and unfinished and
will remain so until revolution itself puts the pleasures of a life without
money, class and State into practice.</font>
<center>
<h2>
<font face="Bookman Old Style">oOo</font></h2></center>
<font face="Bookman Old Style">Sectarianism is one of the characteristics
of periods of social peace and groupings of militants themselves hardly
escape the crazy logic of competition of a society centred on division
and on the war of all against all. Aware of these difficulties and willing
to fight against sectarianism, we try (just as we do in our internal debates)
to systematically put forward <b>our convergence</b> in the framework of
the international community of struggle.</font>
<p><font face="Bookman Old Style">In this sense, we call on all those who
continue to fight against a world based on the exploitation of man by man
to appropriate our texts for themselves, to reproduce, circulate them and
to consider our reviews as theirs. The result of collective works, our
texts are no one's property in particular, they belong to a class that
is living and fighting to abolish its own condition as an exploited class,
and hence all classes, all exploitation.</font>
<p><font face="Bookman Old Style">Just like the revolutionaries who preceded
us, we conceive our press as an indispensable means of revolutionary propaganda,
collective agitation, programmatical development, action.</font>
<p><font face="Bookman Old Style">We want our texts to be subjected to
a militant reading, discussed, criticised and used to confront other positions
in order to clearly define the terrain of revolution and counterrevolution
and to support, always more determinedly, the revolutionary direction imposed
by our class in its constitution as a class and a worldwide historical
force.</font>
<h3>
<u><font face="Bookman Old Style">To our readers</font></u></h3>
<font face="Bookman Old Style">Comrades, a review like this can only fully
succeed in its task of organizing communist action if it has active participation
of its readers and sympathisers. Any contribution you make - theoretical,
critical or practical - will help us to forge a real revolutionary tool.</font>
<p><font face="Bookman Old Style">Use this material! It is no one's private
property - it is part of the heritage of the accumulated experience of
our class. The class that is living, struggling and fighting to destroy
wage-labour and therefore all classes, all exploitation. Use these texts,
discuss them, reproduce them,...</font>
<p><font face="Bookman Old Style">If our positions interest you - if you
want to discuss them or to work with us - contact the <b>Internationalist
Communist Group</b> by writing to the following address, without mentioning
the group's name on the envelope:</font>
