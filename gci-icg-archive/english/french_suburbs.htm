<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's not deny ourselves a good thing. All these
bonfires all over France and even abroad, it's heart-warming. This proves
to anyone who'll listen that when revolt is brewing, it can spread like
wildfire. To those who think revolution is not anymore on the agenda and
that the proletariat is too much resigned, submitted, powerless or even
nonexistent, the fast extension of the movement and its strength proved
the opposite: the proletariat can raise its head. Obviously, we don't kid
ourselves; proletariat's general situation and division didn't allow breaking
enough with the isolation of this struggle at the national and international
level as well. There was no hope that this explosion was able to lead the
whole planet towards a generalized insurrection. Indeed the bourgeoisie
has nowadays the capacity to confine the revolt to a sector of the proletariat,
to avoid it extending too much beyond the borders and to temporarily suppress
it; but we'll not be surprised when the world revolution will emerge so
suddenly in the same way with such violence. Explosions are ineluctably
linked to the daily catastrophe of capital, while the proletariat is standing
up for itself against the increasingly provocative aggressions from this
inhuman mode of production.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">We are against the current of prevailing
pessimism about the capacity of the proletariat to become subject of history
again; we are against the current of all the falsifications and divisions
the state and its servants of all sides try to impose to the movement in
order to better bring discredit on it and to weaken it. Indeed we objectively
see the revolution as a potential behind this movement because we consider
its deeply proletarian nature. We assert very clearly that this movement
is about our class rejecting its situation no more no less. It is also
imperative to be critical, while recognizing our struggling class brothers.
We cannot attribute only to repression and to police armaments the limits
we note in this movement, but we also have to blame the own limits the
proletariat imposes itself, particularly while letting itself be credulous
by ideologies that impede us. Nowadays, many proletarians didn't indeed
recognize themselves in these Molotov cocktails that stroke fear and trembling
into bourgeois order; and this attitude prevented a necessary widening
of the movement, for various reasons we are going to briefly analyse.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">1. Some people considered they are living
better conditions than those who are confined in council housing estates
(HLM). Sure that very soon their turn will come to be relegated to the
scrap heap of capital. Others recognized these living conditions as theirs
but didn't take the initiative to go lending the rebels a hand, because
they were afraid to lose the few things granted by the bourgeoisie in order
to enslave them to a pseudo-comfort. But this comfort hangs by a thread
because our masters are pushed by the wild competition to snatch from our
hands the carrots they offer us and they should use the stick more and
more when we will try to prevent them doing so. Wages are decreasing, employment
stability is part of a mythical past, servitude measures and alienation
mechanisms are getting worse: absurdity of this world is blatant everywhere.
Not many workers, even those who nowadays are struggling in France and
elsewhere, noticed the similarity of their struggle with the one that took
place in front of their eyes.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">2. Others didn't recognize themselves in
these movements because the main actors were youngsters. They didn't notice
these young proletarians were spokespersons, fury holders, despair holders,
of their elders, of their sisters, of the younger generation, etc. who
probably have a lot of greater hang-ups because of their more inconvenient
roles and responsibilities. How is it possible not imagining that many
people supported and took part in the revolt and organized it, at other
levels than to throw oneself into the heat of the action? Maintaining this
confusion while turning it into an issue about youngsters with nothing
to do, this was the main argument used by the bourgeoisie in order to confine
the movement. We don't care how old were the first row actors: in the street,
they were proletarians against the state.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">3. The state promoted the representation
of "immigrants" riots, and a lot of proletarians believe and repeat the
package of clich&eacute;s necessary to differentiate themselves from those
they like calling "riffraff". It is necessary to recall that the capitalistic
society is fundamentally racist. There is no bourgeois fraction, including
the social democratic one, being really antiracist. Those who pretend to
be like this are those who pretend that capitalism could not be racist,
that it could not constantly regenerate the conditions for reproducing
racism within proletarians, who are in competition each other before their
exploiters. Once again during these riots, we saw that the bourgeois discuss
only one thing: the way to bring proletarians under control, while playing
the spectacle of controversies on the level of patriotic citizenship and
"integration" to be granted to the different categories of people who are
in possession of residence permits and definitively provisional papers
as well. The world and racist division of labour is an objective reality,
through the historic differences of submission to exploitation and the
ideologies that justify it. Each proletarian develops his own "origin",
what is differentiating him on the market of labour force, when looking
for a house or facing the cops, etc. We know that the suburbs thrown into
a state of unrest are experiencing an important rate of proletarians from
immigrant extraction, often at the umpteenth generation. We also know that
the social system creates the conditions of social contradictions deterioration,
packing proletarians who cannot bear each other at the end. And once again
the system uses this deterioration against the struggles that inevitably
burst out, stigmatising the "alien" troublemakers. We know that such a
movement leads proletarians into rebellion apart from their origin and
brutally recalls to capital that indeed it does nothing but unifying its
slaves in their misery. This means that we are against the current of those
who falsify movements like this, while considering them as simple exacerbations
of social deterioration peculiar to these housing estates, whose inhabitants
are considered as not "workers" enough and are ideologically deprived of
their statute of proletarians.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">4. The movement started in the suburbs and
many other proletarians didn't either feel concerned, because of that.
Some people because they succeeded in fleeing from these suburbs in order
to buy a less rotten place of residence, and others because they haven't
yet been forced to stay there and feel more sheltered from the ignominy
of housing policies. But it doesn't matter much whether we are herded into
rabbit hutches and boxes, whether we pay for an increasingly exorbitant
rent or whether we are obliged to bleed ourselves dry for paying off a
mortgage. These differences give the idea that we could improve our everyday
life, but as long as we won't get out of prehistory, as long as we won't
abolish capitalistic social relations, our everyday life will ever be to
pay for our right to live; to pay those for whom and through whom the "constitutional
state" has been established. And if the bourgeoisie doesn't have any scruples
about confining our class brothers in ugly tower blocks, we don't delude
on the fact that it has no mercy on any of us and that it will let us die
if we don't show anymore any servility towards this system. The minister
of the interior used a word, which is valid for each of us and through
which we can appreciate how the bourgeoisie holds us in low regard, even
though he tried to limit the impact of this little word only to the troublemakers:
we are all of us riffraff since we are all of us potentially dangerous
for the survival of its world.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">5. The ruling class always managed to keep
the monopoly of violence and to use a part of the exploited class in order
to defend the exploitation. This is really the main key of its long life.
Then, when the proletariat in the suburbs doesn't express itself peacefully,
through sheep-like processions and consensual banners, other proletarians
are shocked. They don't see anymore the historic violence that consists
in making us working every day so as capital grows fat, the subtle violence
constantly acting in order to maintain our submission; and these proletarians
close their eyes before the repression that breaks out against those who
don't accept anymore submissively their living conditions. They forget
that this same bourgeoisie doesn't hesitate to send us violently to war,
for killing and dying if its interests need to make so. They forget the
daily violence of the capitalistic mode of production catastrophe, devastating
the whole planet, and they hide behind natural catastrophes, "interethnic"
conflicts, bad governance, etc. They don't see this violence anymore, this
terrorism the bourgeoisie exercises permanently over and against us, but
moreover they support it while condemning any riposte from their own class
brothers, proletarian riposte that is necessarily a violent one, revolutionary
terror that alone will be able to give birth to a society without violence:
Communism.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">6. The main strength of the movement was
certainly to have nothing to claim. Too much proletarians are accustomed
to claim wages increases, tax decreases, economic or social politics changes,
etc, and this always in a constructive, reasonable, peaceful and legal
way; for a lot of them this movement in the suburbs didn't have any clear
objective and appeared from then on like without perspective or even self-destructive.
Our perspective is nevertheless to have nothing to claim, in the reformist
sense of the word, that is to say to have nothing to expect from the bourgeoisie
but to recover what it appropriated: i.e. the means of life production.
We don't claim anything particularly; we claim all. And therefore, we see
some revolutionary perspectives where many conceal and disguise the reality
behind the permanent apology of the limited framework of punctual claiming,
of "positive" answers to social desires: e.g. a job, a lodging, a wage
and something for distracting us from our true human's desires. In the
movements in question we see a determination for a radical change because
even though it hasn't been clearly verbalized, it clearly expressed itself
in the action. A straight tendency aiming at targeting what destroys us
asserted itself during this movement; we briefly make an assessment about
in our leaflet. Obviously, the whole bourgeois press mobilized itself to
show us a spectacle of nihilistic disaster, unreasoning and blind violence,
morbid game and manipulation. Thus, the medias very rarely spoke about
proletarians and when they did, it was only to point out the owners of
burned-out cars, trying this way to make us believe that proletarians and
bourgeois have the same thing to defend. As an illustration of all this,
we are longing to publish this quotation from an anonymous leaflet that
emerged from the events:</font>
<p><i><font face="Comic Sans MS">"Simply burning the scenery we don't want
to see anymore, the one of oppressive misery, the one of confining and
suffocating concrete city. Burning public transport that humiliates the
impossibility to get out of this greyish everyday life. Burning the schools
of "The Republic" that are the first places of exclusion, selection, sorting,
classifying, where training to obedience is learnt. Burning town halls,
managers of misery, and police stations, synonymous for humiliation, bullying,
thrashing and beating. Burning the state that manages these open-air jails.
Burning political parties' offices. Burning scornful politicians. Burning
the elite. Burning warehouses of merchandises, cars dealers, banks, video
clubs, supermarkets, shopping centres, television studio of production,
etc. Burning and not stealing (1). Just to see this merchandise going up
in smoke, the one for which we have to work hard and it's quite "normal"
to desire, consume and accumulate. Burning because it seems to be the only
way to make oneself heard, to be not anymore invisible. Burning with the
obvious hope to see things changing."</font></i>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">7. As usual, the medias fully relayed the
hackneyed idea according to which unscrupulous gangsters or "radical Islamists"
could only lead the movement. This is another element of the arsenal of
measures set up in order to avoid things going from bad to worse for the
state, which has been forced to acknowledge afterwards, especially through
its political police service "Renseignements G&eacute;n&eacute;raux" (2),
that it was nothing of the kind; but the doubt thus created about insurgents'
motivations had the desirable impact: denying and concealing the essentially
proletarian characteristic of the movement. The trap of hijacking is obviously
very present but quite as much by Islamist gurus than by those of traditional
left, or in other words by religious or laic social democracy, all of them
united and working at the burial of our struggle. From everywhere one heard
calling for peace. Because it was impossible for them to deny state-controlled
violence and social deterioration, most of the left-wing organizations
took refuge behind the stinking watchword according to which "it is necessary
to substitute for the police state of emergency, a social state of emergency".
Which means more local and community policemen in our neighbourhoods, more
social workers (i.e. social cops), more animators and educators acting
as social peacekeepers, more slave drivers for "new labour markets", etc.
Social state is police state forever. Repression and reformism: same fighting!</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">The consequence of all these smokescreens
was that our brothers in the suburbs were alone to confront the state.
Few proletarians from outside joined their struggle. They could have made
it outside of the suburbs; capital is indeed everywhere. But the division
of the proletariat allowed once again the repression forces to restore
temporarily law and order in the proletarian neighbourhoods. Those who,
either actively or through their passivity, support repression in France,
also allow repression forces to crush our struggles elsewhere, e.g. in
Iraq, in Bolivia, in Algeria, etc. These armed forces from different nations
are able to unite when capital is in danger somewhere on the planet. They
fear more than everything that the proletariat in their own country unite
through concomitant action with their brothers from elsewhere; because
this situation would hinder them in the realization of their crimes. We
are going to draw a temporary conclusion because history didn't yet conclude;
this movement will rebound sooner or later with renewed vigour. Let's keep
the fire going, this fire that gave life to the movement, so that the wind
of revolt will then blow, even stronger, up to outside of the suburbs.</font>
<p><b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Repression was hard, with the consequence
that many of our brothers were jailed in capital's prisons. It doesn't
matter much whether those who have been repressed are guilty or not from
the point of view of law and order. It's our class that has been attacked
and whatever we can do for getting them out of there, let's do it!</font></b>
<p><b><font face="Comic Sans MS">A lot of associations advocating citizenship
are going to try to get us walking for more justice: let's outflank them!</font></b>
<p><b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Social peacekeepers tried to restore law
and order in the housing estates: let's keep them in our mind!</font></b>
<p><b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Organizational structures of the struggle
were informally or formally set up: let's try to keep and develop them!</font></b>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">1 - What a pity that struggling proletarians
didn't have more opportunities to reappropriate a part of the wealth produced
by our class!</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">2 - Here is a quotation of the "Renseignements
G&eacute;n&eacute;raux" report of November 23th, 2005: "France experienced
a kind of unorganised insurrection with the emergence in time and space
of a popular revolt in the suburbs, without any leader and without proposition
for a program. (...) Youngsters in the suburbs developed a strong sense
of identity based not only on their ethnic or geographical origin, but
on their condition of victims of social exclusion in this country."</font>

<hr NOSHADE WIDTH="100%">
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">In relation with these movements in France,
here are the positions of those who think the revolution won't be the outburst
of all social passions produced by the capital's disaster, but rather a
well-ordered and conscious task of national and local workers who are mature,
responsible, pacific, well-disciplined through labour. Those ones either
don't want the riffraff blow up the very foundations of this world.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Echoing the Minister of the Interior Sarkozy
who declared wanting "to clean up the riffraff in the suburbs with a K&auml;rcher"
[with a high-pressure water cleaner], a few organizations pretending to
be on the proletarian side showed their true colours, while denying class
struggle. We have to emphasize here some quotations:</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">"What is most striking about these actions,
apart from the extent of the damage and violence, is their total absurdity.
[...] In the same way, the injuries inflicted on the fire-fighters, people
whose job is to protect others, often at risk to their own lives, are truly
shocking. [...] The depredations committed in the poor neighbourhoods night
after night have nothing whatever to do with the struggle of the working
class." (International Communist Current - 8th November 2005) [http://en.internationalism.org]</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">"The informal political expression of this
urban violence is not compatible with the perspective of independent proletarian
struggle. [...] It is necessary to work for the cessation of acts which
only aggravate the already difficult situation of the working class." (Mouvement
Communiste - Letter number 19 - December 2005) [www.mouvement-communiste.com]</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">"The propagation of acts of violence is unacceptable
for the populations concerned. Order must be re-established. It is urgent
to take a series of measures which will allow us to put an end to a more
and more dangerous development. The security of everyone cannot be re-established
by accepting the escalation of violence." (French Communist Party - 6th
November 2005) [quoted by Mouvement Communiste]</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Obviously, there is nothing new in the fact
that organizations self-proclaimed as being on the side of the proletariat
are denigrating the struggle of the proletariat and are in fact supporters
of bourgeois law and order they pretend to call into question. If we publish
these pearls, it's not only to emphasize the practical counterrevolutionary
role these groups are playing, but moreover to denounce a general conception
of the proletariat (workerist, (male) chauvinist, europeist, unionist,
etc.), which inevitably leads to a counterrevolutionary practice.</font>
