The “Short walk under the black sun of capital” we published in our review
in French <i>Communisme </i>n&deg;59 (October 2007) –and to which we will
hereafter refer as the editorial of this review- has given rise to reactions
and discussions. The mainly criticized problem is, with good reason, its
lack of distance as regards Mike Davis’ book “<i>Planet of Slums</i>” (Verso,
2006) from which we took many facts and information and quoted long excerpts.
By doing so, some aspects of the author’s ideology obviously sneaked in
our editorial, ideology that we don’t share and with which we didn’t clarify
our divergences. We can mention, for example, with regard to Brazil or
Argentina, the fact to attribute the working-class districts cleansing
exclusively to the “military junta” whereas actually this policies has
been led, with an exemplary continuity, by all successive governments for
decades. In a more general way, we must admit that by taking Mike Davis’s
book as main reference, the editorial mostly focused on the most extreme
cases of <i>absolute
</i>poverty, and therefore marginalized the importance
of the <i>relative
</i>deterioration of the proletariat’s survival conditions,
i.e. the attacks against these conditions and their consequences, whatever
their initial level. So although the editorial emphasized the similarities
between several situations that masses of proletarians are submitted to,
it did not sufficiently insist on the unavoidable exacerbation of the generalized
relative misery as a general limit of the bourgeois society.
<p>In any case, the editorial should at least have been more critical regarding
the limits of the main source used, to keep its distance from it or even
to develop the antagonism between certain positions of the author and our
own framework, as we already did by the way with this same author –Mike
Davis- when we extensively referred to his book “<i>City of Quartz</i>”
to write our text on jails in the USA, published in French in <i>Communisme
</i>n&deg;50
(June 2000). Here is the critique:
<p>“<i>Most of the information we give here about Los Angeles are taken
from ‘City of Quartz: Excavating the Future in Los Angeles’ by Mike Davis,
Knopf Publishing Group (1992), chapter 4, ‘Fortress L.A.’. The author provides
a lot of information that allows defining the reality of social classes
and capitalism in the United States, but he falls back into the dullest
reformism as soon as he ventures into concrete action propositions (which
also show the limits of the understanding that leads to the description
of this social reality). Among other things, Mike Davis promotes a private
bill recommending the organization of an urban peacekeeping force –i.e.
cops- intended to help and to supervise a process of truce between the
gangs in Los Angeles! Another blatant evidence that reformism, however
original in its form, inevitably ends up calling for new police forces.</i>”
<p>Beyond the problems that we have just clarified, it is also obvious
that the relation between the deterioration of proletarians’ survival conditions
and what we are firstly interested in –i.e. the revolution- is not explicit
in our editorial. The proletariat as a subject of the revolution emerges
there only through the final quotation of Pannekoek. Although it expresses
the fundamentals of our program, the connection between the deepening of
the crises, the development of the proletariat’s struggles and the meltdown
of capitalism is envisioned in an exceedingly global way, valid for any
given moment in time, and cannot depict how exceptional the present situation
of capitalism is. Let’s use again the conclusions preceding this quotation
in our last review:
<p>“<i>All along this walk under the black sun of capital, we tried to
broach the capitalist catastrophe from the point of view of the proletariat’s
day-to-day life all over the planet while providing a series of concrete
examples. It seems to us important to put a reality on words and not content
ourselves with merely expressing what exists. This catastrophe is so deep
today that it immediately became palpable, visible and condenses in all
the aspects of proletarians’ life; firstly in work: never has it been so
hard, destructive and so few remunerative. Food then, always more deteriorated
and contaminated to such a level that it kills as much, if not more, than
it feeds. Housing conditions also probably reached unprecedented horrendous
levels; we have extensively described them. And then diseases, always more
virulent and massive, destroying and crushing thousands of lives. Wars
also, always more widespread and destructive. The biotope finally, which
is used as environment for our species, always more damaged, always more
dangerous, always more poisoned… giving hints that in the decades to come
its destruction may well be a possibility, causing the end of everything
that lives on the surface of the globe. In short, capitalism, in a visible
and palpable way, appears for an increasing mass of proletarians all over
the world for what it really is: an apocalypse, a hell. One could endlessly
add on to this description only to reach the same conclusions: capital
ended up exacerbating to an extraordinary level most of its own contradictions
and especially the most essential, i.e. the production of a plethoric social
class for which it has no use regarding the present necessities of its
own valorisation-devalorisation. Today too many capitals fail to valorise
themselves, devalorisation strikes everywhere including among variable
capital, i.e. proletarians. And as Marx emphasized in the Manifesto of
the Communist Party: ‘And how does the bourgeoisie get over these crises?
On the one hand, by enforced destruction of a mass of productive forces;
on the other, by the conquest of new markets, and by the more thorough
exploitation of the old ones. That is to say, by paving the way for more
extensive and more destructive crises, and by diminishing the means whereby
crises are prevented.’</i>
<p><i>Generalized pauperisation, ever harder conditions of exploitation,
epidemics, generalized poisoning of air, water and food, famines, and spread
of war… by these means the massive destruction of the proletariat is presently
enforced. The bourgeoisie still manages –for the time being- to control
this excess labour force, this excess proletariat. It still manages to
discipline it, to humble it, put it to work, to convince it to enlist in
the unions, to force it to accept its fate, etc., to have die it in camps,
and wars… but as we can notice it day after day, the process of valorisation-devalorisation
races out of control and calls for new wars, always fiercer, always more
destructive. The capitalist ogre commands to his managers to quench its
thirst, it keeps demanding more blood; its appetite of cadavers is growing
and unappeasable. The capitalist agenda, aiming at boosting a new cycle
of growth, calls for the death of excess proletarians and the massive destruction
of capitals that cannot valorise. For capital the local wars are not good
enough anymore, it is necessary to GENERALIZE them! The very survival of
capital is at stake.</i>”
<p>As we can see, the conclusion insisted on the ineluctable deepening
of the contradiction between human needs and capital’s needs –and war is
the peak of these needs- but didn’t broach the question of how the development
of this contradiction materializes on the grounds of open confrontation
between classes.
<p>Not that this issue is unfamiliar to us: we have always examined it,
actually, not without some polemic, but it never led to the publication
of a specific material. Therefore the quotation of Pannekoek doesn’t appear
to be the conclusion of the process of our reflection, but a mere theoretical
view or expression of wishful thinking. Indeed, in the absence of a relevant
explanation, the affirmation according to which “<i>the emancipation of
the proletariat by itself is the meltdown of capitalism</i>” appears like
an abstract formula and a controversial issue. The reader could consequently
conclude to a mechanicist conception of the revolutionary process, according
to which “capital, initiating its decomposition phase, would inevitably
trigger the emergence of a class <i>for itself</i>, of a genuine ‘revolutionary
proletariat’, stripped of the contradictions that undermined the class
<i>as
itself</i>”. (1) This kind of schematic vision was certainly not endorsed
by our editorial but we must admit that in the absence of any clarification
about the issue of the capitalism meltdown, about the relation between
objective conditions and subjective action of the proletariat, confusion
was still possible.
<br><a NAME="destructured"></a>
<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">Destructured Proletariat and Ideology</font></u></h2>
Actually this very discussion about the relation between the capital’s
catastrophe and its positive destruction by the proletariat is a constant
feature of the whole history of our movement, the whole history of the
revolutionary proletariat, the whole history of the party. Ever since our
group was born, we have approached it through several points of view. Obviously,
the kind of short cuts we made in the editorial (regarding this discussion
between the observation of the catastrophe and the revolution) is a reflection
of the very weakness of our movement and its vanguard expressions. It is
all together emblematic of the depth of the catastrophe of life under capital
at its every level and the pathetic level of proletarian associationism
and of the structuring of the revolutionary centralization at the international
level. Far from waning, the contradiction is continually deepening, between
the complete inability of the capitalist mode of production to tend to
the needs of large masses of human beings and the organization in force
of the world proletariat to destroy this society. Nowadays, all revolutionary
expressions face a real difficulty in expressing the relation between catastrophe
and revolution, between the aggravation of living conditions and the revolutionary
destruction of the present society.
<p>Globally, this is the result of a whole series of ideological triumphs
of capital that dissuades whatever proletarian associations and struggles
carried through with their own perspectives. Here are some significant
themes:
<ul>
<li>
The collapse of the Marxist-Leninist model of capitalism is not envisioned
by the masses as the death of Stalinism and all the forces that supported
the Leninist counterrevolution but, on the contrary, as the end of the
very possibility of a communist revolution. Generations of combative proletarians
experienced a profound disheartenment and were doomed to accept capitalism
as only possible world.</li>

<li>
The obvious lack of human perspective put forward by the bourgeois society
is therefore not transformed into a revolutionary force claiming Communism
as sole perspective, because Communism itself has become unfathomable,
or even equated to a monstrous concentration camp society, which, far from
abolishing the evils of the bourgeois society actually brings them to a
climax.</li>

<li>
The propaganda in favour of the reign of money as the only viable option,
thus loses its extreme-rightist, ridiculous and sectarian character to
become the very substance of all political speech, the horizon of the run-of-the-mill
discussion. Even more so, for the first time in the history of the bourgeois
society, the view that “reasonable” propositions may not venture beyond
reformism has not only become credible, but also unquestionable.</li>

<li>
The whole political spectrum adheres to this omnipresent reformism; “<i>yes,
another world is possible</i>”. But, even under new leaders, or new reforms
such as “Tobin Tax”, it is always the same world in disguise.</li>

<li>
Freedom of choice, citizen life, democracy, popular participation… everything
that corroborates and consolidates individualism, and false communities,
has not only become the only accepted stance but has establish itself as
a democratic totalitarianism, excluding and repressing any proletarian
class expression.</li>

<li>
Proletarian associationism itself is isolated and condemned like a sect
by this omnipresent democratic totalitarianism. Rather than trying to achieve
a somewhat higher degree of organization, of association or even of solidarity
between proletarians, people claim they are “free”, and that they live
“unfettered and without constraints”, thus endorsing the very idea of their
enslavement, the key ideology of commodity and State.</li>
</ul>
But the general difficulty in expressing the present contradictory relation
between catastrophe and revolution is also due to capital’s own mechanisms
of reproduction, <i>pre-ideological</i> mechanisms, so to speak, or, in
other words, the raw material of ideologies.
<ul>
<li>
We generally refer to mercantile mechanisms as reproducing the atomised
individual, i.e. the production and reproduction of the individual as isolated
seller of his labour force, the all-pervading antagonism between sellers
and buyers’ interests, and the production and reproduction of the very
democratic mechanisms.</li>

<li>
Not only are these mechanisms at the root of isolation and of the mythology
of the freedom of choice, but they are also at the root of the <i>social
naturalization</i> of the individual, as if it had always existed and was
going to last forever. This naturalization of the individual consolidates
the belief in all other ideological naturalizations of the bourgeois society
(money, State, private property… considered as a-historical realities)
and allows to exclude, as a <i>natural opposition</i>, any demonstration
of the historical tendency of the proletariat to constitute itself as a
revolutionary party, which “quite naturally” will be categorized as being
sectarian, terrorist, authoritative, dogmatic…</li>
</ul>
The “every man for himself” attitude is simultaneously a product of the
evolution of the commodity society and a producer of goods, which in turn
reinforces the generalized isolation. Thus, if television (and its complements
such as video games and others) was a decisive step against any proletarians’
associative life, the persistent and ever-increasing trend towards the
subordination of life to the image and the spectacle continues to deepen.
The widespread current tendency to substitute (still slightly) real relations
for virtual relations is another remarkable qualitative leap in the production
of the bourgeois individual, epitome of the “every man for himself”, in
other words, “all against all”.
<p>Capitalism separated human beings, turning them into individuals via
property and commodity. It subordinated all human relations to representations,
which were mediatised by images, and dissolved in the spectacle of a world
ridded of its fundamental contradiction. But now, in order to be granted
access to the “true” realm of relations between isolated individuals, happy
ownership of a series of technological portable artefacts (telephony, computers,
audio…) is mandatory. These artefacts –ephemeral and replaceable- permanently
and instantaneously connect <i>the separated, evidencing their separated
condition</i> (along with connecting the ultra-available employee to his
exploiters). These artefacts grant to the multitude of sick and anguished
egos an “active status” in the present world, and this “status” is constructed
by the “personal choices”, picked from a mass-produced palette, and supposed
to give to these relations a sense of humanity.
<ul>
<li>
This “virtualisation” of all relations is a product of the present evolution
of capitalism. Simultaneously, this virtualisation requires the production
and ceaseless improvement of goods capable of enforcing a total separation
between the human beings as well as providing a link between the individuals
kept apart. This is no less than the icing on the cake of democracy (2),
the peak of the historical mission of the commodity society.</li>

<li>
These are obviously the ideal conditions for the blossoming of all these
false communities, witnessed and experienced by the atomised individuals
through the triumph of no matter what flag: sports club, nation, ethnic
group, religion, and race…</li>

<li>
Associationism based on the material and universal interests of the proletariat
not only becomes growingly difficult, but, most of all, “illogical”. In
a world where it became “natural” to fight for the sake of whatever specific
flag it is logically “anti-natural” that the human beings organize themselves
in conformity with their vital and universal class interests, all the more
in order to carry out an “utopian” world revolution.</li>

<li>
Class unawareness is an everyday obviousness. All proletarian expressions
meet the same international incomprehension, if not simply liquidated by
the repression achieved by other proletarians, on behalf of such or such
international police.</li>

<li>
This whole development of the bourgeois society fails to solve any of the
vital human problems under the “black sun of capital”. Neither will the
continuous aggravation of the capitalist catastrophe ever come to a halt.
In spite of that, all proletarian associations of this planet aiming at
strengthening and developing centralization and internationalisation (in
other words, at reconstituting the proletariat as a party), are still being
targeted by the full spectrum of liquidation and socialization mechanisms.</li>
</ul>
Our close comrades, our contacts and the groups related to us experience
this reality on a daily basis. We suffer in our very flesh this brutal
contradiction between the aggravation of all our living conditions and
the brutal lack of proletarian associationism, the lack of consciousness
and the lack of centralization of our forces. This is why it is so difficult
nowadays to express the revolutionary perspective.
<p>And that is true for the discussions that preceded the writing of our
editorial in the French review: while aiming at conveying our perspective,
they exposed our weaknesses, i.e. those of our class and of all contemporary
revolutionary minorities. They revealed that the revolutionary perspective
is, as it has always been, an issue that cannot be solved by any party
or organization. In the same way they revealed that the problems from which
we suffer in our very flesh are not specific to our group, nor will they
be solved by the mere will to do so. These discussions urged us, again
and again, to look for solutions, not in such or such recipe on what should
be done or on what slogans to brandish. That is what all opportunists do,
and they end up being subdued by whatever reformist program (and ultimately
by socialization and by the cult of individual freedom). On the contrary,
we look for solutions in the contradictions that are specific to the capital’s
functioning, and in its inability to satisfy the most elementary interests
of human being.
<p>If our editorial has mostly focused on the heights –in <i>absolute
</i>terms-
reached by the deterioration of the proletariat’s survival conditions throughout
the world (shanty towns, poisoning, drugs, atomisation, etc.), it seems
important to us (specifically in this text, in the light of the development
of the class struggles in 2007-2008), to stress on the increase of the
brutal deterioration –this time in <i>relative </i>terms- of proletarians’
survival conditions throughout the world, regardless of the levels reached.
Thus, the last explosion of prices for oil and foodstuffs was directly
translated into an attack against the standard of living – to various degrees
indeed- of all proletarians throughout the world, and this attack didn’t
even spare the less “underprivileged” strata. This massive and general
attack against the proletarians’ standard of living provoked, the first
time for long, a reaction of the proletariat directly on a planetary scale,
if not in the homogeneity of its expressions (or even less in the acknowledgment
of this organic nature by the proletariat itself), at least in the simultaneity
in the revolt. The simplification of the contradictions, which the revolutionaries
always referred to, made thus a gigantic step forward. We deem it important
to dwell on these events, as well as on the ruling class’ endeavour to
conceal and keep this process in check.
<br><a NAME="elements"></a>
<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">A Few Elements on the Present Struggles of
our Class and on the Way their Organic Essential Nature is Concealed by
our Enemies</font></u></h2>
Unable to veil completely the various reactions of our class throughout
the world, the bourgeois media strive to act as the martinet of the capitalist
order (with the Marxist-Leninist press, as usual, carrying out the dirty
job with great zeal) by having them appear to be totally unrelated, with
a completely different nature and origin. Where we see different expressions
of a same fundamental proletarian reaction against the attacks of world
capital, in their widest meaning, against their survival conditions (exploitation,
wages, wars, deportations, repression, social putrefaction…), the media
(irrespective of which side they belong to) persist in differentiating
them by creating strict separations between what they call:
<ol>
<li>
“Hunger riots” which affect about thirty countries of the so-called Third
World, forming, according to them, a highly dangerous belt that surrounds
the globe from latitude 30&deg; north to the equator. In that category,
the proletariat’s reactions against the crisis in Mexico, in Haiti, in
a dozen of countries of Western and Central Africa (e.g. Guinea, Ivory
Coast, Nigeria, Senegal, Cameroon, Somalia, Sudan, etc.), in Egypt, in
the Indian peninsula (Pakistan, India, Bangladesh) and finally in Southeast
Asia (China, Vietnam, Thailand, etc.), and in Indonesia. These “hunger
riots” are portrayed as being specifically due to the perpetuation of the
North-South trade unbalances inherited from the colonization, due to the
Western Stock Markets speculation over the production of “Third World”
countries. It is also portrayed as being due to the destruction of local
mixed farming, notably following the WB and IMF so-called neo-colonialist
policies, which condition the granting of financial loans to single-crop
farming for export products;</li>

<li>
Demonstrations “against the high cost of living” and strikes to protest
against the reduction of the so-called “purchasing power” (3) (United States,
Western and Eastern Europe, some countries of Latin America);</li>

<li>
“Suburbs riots” in European countries and some countries of Latin America,
portrayed as being the expression of youth’s malaise, especially youngsters
of immigrant extraction and/or those left out of “the world of work” (4);</li>

<li>
“Terrorist attacks” and revolts against the military and other State and
State-like institutions in countries where the world centralization of
State terror is enforced through military occupation and/or humanitarian
operations (Haiti, Ivory Coast, Somalia, Guinea, Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan,
Palestine and other territories under State of Israel’s terror…) as well
as in countries where the central strategy of the bourgeois repression
focuses on amalgamating systematically the movement of the proletariat
with nationalist and/or Marxist-Leninist organizations (Basque Country
in Spain, Colombia, Chechnya, Nepal). (5)</li>
</ol>
On the grounds of these separations, Social Democracy finds it easy to
claim that these problems “with a specific nature and origin” require specific
solutions:
<ol>
<li>
International regulation of world economic policies, when dealing with
“hunger riots”;</li>

<li>
Wage increase (a revised cost of living index) and a governmental policy
of price control on vital commodities, housing and energy, when dealing
with “demonstrations against the high cost of living”;</li>

<li>
Access of young people of immigrant extraction to the world of work, when
dealing with “suburbs riots”;</li>

<li>
Pacification of the so-called ungovernable zones by means of military,
and humanitarian, interventions aiming at restoring a “democratic process”
of decision and action.</li>
</ol>
In every one of theses specific cases, these reformist and humanitarian
solutions are put forward as an improvement of the proletariat’s living
conditions, while preserving the capitalist system. They are nothing but
quarantine lines intending to prevent the expansion of the struggles of
our class throughout the world.
<p>Even more so, to make a strict distinction between “riots” (when referring
to the proletariat’s reactions in countries of the so-called Third World,
or in the suburbs), “demonstrations” and “strikes” (when referring to the
proletarians’ reaction in the so-called developed countries) or “terrorist
attacks” (when referring to the proletariat’s reactions in the “ungovernable
zones” of the world) stands as the first quarantine line against the unification
of the proletariat’s struggle in the world.
<p>What about the word “riot”? It is very distinctly and pejoratively connoted
by years of Social Democratic propaganda and equated to “the unleashing
of the vilest instincts of the human being”, the “archaic and primary”
reaction of “the masses”, before the maturation of the “workers’ movement”
(i.e. its containment and neutralization by Social Democracy). From the
good citizen’s point of view, this word means “uncivilized” or “pre-democratic”
struggles. It is systematically used to refer to proletarians’ struggles
in the so-called underdeveloped countries, in the Western suburbs, or even
to designate workers’ actions seen as a little too “wild”. This clearly
upholds the ideology according to which these struggles are completely
different from those of the “working class” of the Western countries –an
inferior type, in form and ambition-. Thus, these terminological distinctions
contribute to the ideology that contends that the pacifist methods imposed
by Social Democracy, consisting of demonstrations and pseudo-strikes, are
<i>the
</i>form
of struggle specific to the salaried workers of the so-called developed
capitalist countries. Allegedly, these struggles have anything in common
with the bursts of anger –“spontaneous, disorganized and with ambiguous
purposes”- caused by suburbs “riffraff” or by “idle lumpenproletarians”
in the so-called Third World countries. Nor does it have anything in common
with those who “organize wildcat strikes and violent actions”, or with
the “small extremist groups” that carry out “terrorist” attacks against
military, political or economic structures of the State.
<p>In the same way, the labelling of certain reactions of our class as
“hunger revolts” and “Third World” suggests that those who are not hungry
are not concerned, nor are those who don’t live in the so-called Third
World. This is a way of pretending that the capitalist society that produces
the most powerful computers, that builds the most fantastic cities and
weapons of massive destruction, differs from the one responsible for world
starvation and the dwindling of the real wage of all proletarians throughout
the world. Yet, if we consider food as an effective satisfaction of human
needs, as a matter of fact all proletarians under the capitalist mode of
production are “hungry” for real, human, food. With the spread of junk
food –emptied of all essential trace element, devitaminized, toxic, etc.-
all the proletarians are, <i>in substance</i>, “starved” by capital, as
they are increasingly prone to serious nutritional deficiencies all around
the world, without any exception and especially not in the so-called developed
countries, where
<i>fast food</i> rules supreme, i.e. “the food whose sole
purpose is to regenerate labour force in the fastest possible way”. This
is another aspect of the ever more blatant inability of capital to feed
mankind effectively, anywhere on this planet.
<p>Finally, and this point relates to the two first ones, there is a whole
terminology, with terms such as “under-developed”, “developing”, “emerging”
countries or “Third World”, that aims at depicting these countries as being
less capitalistic, when actually famines are the purest product of capitalism.
By concealing the reasons one conceals the solutions: the destruction of
capitalism. By particularizing the starvation problem –or the problems
of the so-called Third World in general- one veils the spread of the capitalist
attack against the proletariat, the homogenisation of proletarians’ living
conditions on an international scale, and obviously one also conceals the
common proletarian nature of the attacks against capital and the State
that are taking place before our eyes.
<p>The use of this whole terminology is not neutral. It has two concomitant
purposes: the liquidation of the general character of the proletariat’s
reactions and of their revolutionary perspective against a hostile global
system.
<p>These clich&eacute;s conveyed painstakingly by the bourgeois media don’t
survive our analysis of these different movements of struggle of the proletariat
all over the world. Even through the bourgeois information filter, it is
not difficult to grasp that:
<ol>
<li>
“Hunger riots” in the so-called under-developed countries are also marked
by strikes of salaried employees and that demonstrations targeted, as everywhere
else, the State structures that barred their way, including the international
humanitarian forces that support the local governments policies of repression
and law and order enforcement.</li>

<li>
“Demonstrations and strikes against the high cost of living” by proletarians
in European countries carried on, on a number of occasions, beyond the
level of pacifist demonstrations and strikes organized by Social Democracy.
During these struggles, proletarians resorted to various direct actions
and spontaneous sabotages against production, breaking with the democratic
procedures of social dialogue (e.g. Spanish fishermen blocked up harbours,
truck drivers blockaded highways in France, in Spain, etc.);</li>

<li>
Suburbs “rioters”, far from only attacking their neighbours’ cars and bus
shelters, as reported by the bourgeois media, actually attacked a great
number of targets responsible, on a daily basis, for the “big racket of
capital” upon our lives. Thus, they showed that the objectives of their
struggle are much clearer than the bunch of Leninists claim they are, who
see these “rioters” as modern “lumpenproletarians”. They also showed that
their struggle is straightforwardly directed against the capital’s State
and all its branches, against wage labour, and value: police stations,
town halls, public services, law courts, schools, party offices –regardless
of their creed-, associations offices, French Electricity and Gas Board
agencies [EDF-GDF], electric transformers, banks and cash dispensers, real
estate agencies, temping agencies, jobcentres [ANPE], post offices, car
dealers, shopping centres, fast food, sports and arts centres, tourist
information centres, agencies, media’s vehicles and journalists, etc.</li>

<li>
“Ungovernable zones” are actually social powder kegs, and this has been
true for years. Behind the veil of religious, nationalist or inter-ethnic
conflicts (6), the media hide a very tense social reality where working
conditions, wages and strong unemployment rate have provoked, and continue
to do so, important strikes and demonstrations of proletarians, violently
repressed by the current governments. The exacerbation of social tensions
in these regions have sometimes generated pre-insurrectionary situations
where proletarians overtly confronted all the State forces, forcing international
forces (humanitarian and/or military ones) to intervene in order to try
to restore social order.</li>
</ol>
Finally, we must point out that some situations of struggle are so hard
to relate with any of these patterns that the media fail to shove them
into a precise category and consider them as “uncategorizable”, like the
struggles that have been unfolding for several years in Haiti, Algeria,
Bolivia, Chile, Mexico, etc. According to the bourgeois categories, it
is not a matter of “under-developed” countries or countries in a declared
state of war. These struggles feature near-insurrectionary aspects that
are way beyond the framework of wage struggles and suburban “riots”. Moreover
they root themselves in the long-term, due to their durability or recurrent
flare ups, and this must be highlighted in a period of brutal but ephemeral
explosions of social unrest such as the present. These examples also reveal
that the radicalisation and the very development of the struggles make
their falsification –resorting to the rigid above-mentioned categories-
more difficult.

<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">The Proletarian Struggles are One and the
Same Struggle</font></u></h2>
The arduous context of present times makes it difficult for the proletarian
movement to express the relation between catastrophe and revolution, between
the aggravation of the conditions of life and the revolutionary destruction
of the current society. In this context, it is evocative that a proletarian
group such as “<i>Echanges et Mouvement</i>” relays, in some measure, the
separations we mentioned above. This group did an excellent job on “the
explosive belt” in the issue No.124 of their publication “<i>Echanges</i>”
(Spring 2008) – to which we have widely referred. However, in the same
issue, there is an article whose title is “<i>European Union – struggle
for improved wages and abolition of wage labour</i>”. While we deem important
to highlight the relation between the struggles for better wages and the
abolition of wage labour, it is clear that our comrades from that group
have not come to the same conclusions as in their article on the “explosive
belt”. Indeed, in spite of the article referring to the troubles originating
in social misery and mentioning “<i>beyond all particularities, a sort
of global movement against a system…</i>”, the article of “<i>Echanges</i>”
indicates nowhere that this global movement against capitalism aims at
its destruction, that the proletarians struggle concomitantly for better
wages and for the abolition of wage labour and the stranglehold of commodity.
In other words, if the article relevantly refers to the struggle against
the loss of so-called “purchasing power” in Europe as a struggle for the
abolition of wage labour, it misses the point about the social misery troubles,
as if they were distinct from the struggles for the abolition of wage labour.
Maybe the articles were not written by the same authors, and maybe our
comrades from “<i>Echanges</i>” clearly identify these struggles as being
directed against wage labour, but it’s profoundly regrettable that they
attribute this aim to the European struggles alone. In spite of their real
efforts to report and analyse the ongoing struggles, this equivocation
plays into the game of those endeavouring to divide the proletariat, the
game of the Social Democratic myths of Progress, as if Europe stood closer
to the struggle to terminate capitalism. This view implies that proletarians
whose loss of “purchasing power” does not plunge them straight into starvation
would find it easier to struggle against the abolition of wage labour.
In such a statement, the absurdity of this view appears more than obvious.
According to it, in a country such as Mexico, where the proletariat has
massively taken to the streets to protest against the price of the tortilla,
and where the whole of the proletariat is concerned, some struggle for
the abolition of wage labour (those who are not hungry?) and some don’t!
<p>In view of the importance of this question, let us examine this statement
of “<i>Echanges et Mouvement</i>”: “<i>It is in the struggle against the
wage labour social relations, against wage labour itself, that the proletariat
will achieve emancipation, that it will cease to be a class as itself (a
class for capital) and become a class for itself. This is the process that
we must emphasize even though in Europe there is a significant difference
compared to the characteristics of the struggle in the so-called ‘emerging’
countries.</i>” As we see, it is impossible to make out what sort of distinction
the comrades tried to establish. Furthermore, they added in a note: “<i>When
Marx says ‘the proletariat is revolutionary or it is nothing’ this means
the individualized, scattered, proletariat is nothing but a class as itself.
The struggle and solidarity of the class for itself makes it the product
of a process that goes beyond the mere class antagonism.</i>”
<p>At the heart of the question, we affirm on the contrary, with no ambiguity,
that all struggles have a common origin and therefore a common goal, that
is to say they are directed against the same target, the growing misery
to which we are exposed by the present society. The quibbling about “<i>class
as itself</i>” and “<i>class for itself</i>” that “<i>Echanges</i>” added
clarifies nothing about this supposed distinction and only contributes
to the confusion, by making it out to be a dualist opposition between struggles
directed against wage labour social relations and struggles that aren’t!
(This opposition is typical of the Social Democracy and we really didn’t
expect our comrades of “<i>Echanges et Mouvement</i>” to fall for it).
Or else, do our comrades suggest that such distinction is a matter of consciousness,
and by doing so adhere to the Social Democratic Leninist caricature? Even
then, do they really believe that the proletariat in Europe displays a
higher degree of consciousness, or are any closer to becoming a “<i>class
for itself</i>”?
<p>As far as we’re concerned, let us be clear: there are no two distinct
struggles. Any struggle against the increase of proletarian misery is simultaneously
a struggle against the bourgeois society, no matter that the proletarians
carrying on these struggles are aware of that or not, or, in other words,
regardless of the different levels of consciousness that animate the struggles.
We believe that our comrades from “<i>Echange et Mouvement</i>” could hardly
produce a single argument to vindicate the so-called “<i>very different
characteristics</i>” of the struggle in Europe.
<p>The only relevant distinction is precisely not to be found in the distinction
between countries, or between Europe and the rest of the world, but rather
between different sectors of every country’s proletariat. On one hand,
the sectors of the proletariat that are most subject to coercion from parties,
trade-unions and other State apparatuses; and on the other hand, those
sectors less integrated, such as the jobless, the poor suburbs dwellers,
the so-called marginalized, the lumpenproletariat, the immigrants, the
“landless peasants”. True, as far as riots are concerned, the so-called
“third-world” comes more easily to mind than Europe, where we are more
accustomed to workers social protests channelled by stoppages of work and
peaceful demonstrations. It is also true that nowadays, in Europe, the
very term “riot” only seems to be associated with suburbs dwellers, with
the marginalized and the “excluded”. That is the real difference: the quarantine
lines that the bourgeoisie endeavours to impose everywhere in order to
divide the proletariat. On one hand, the politically correct protests,
the legal stoppages of work, the flock of sheep-like marches and pseudo-protests;
on the other hand, the “riots” from uncontrolled elements. All sectors
of Social Democracy, but in particular the Marxist-Leninists, go to great
lengths to explain that “real proletarians” should not be lured by the
“suburbs scum” or the “lumpenproletariat”, and that “real proletarians”
should join the trade-unions.
<p>However, in spite of all the efforts of Social Democracy aiming at dividing
the proletariat, the media find it harder and harder to conceal the generalized
character of the price rise of foodstuffs. The worldwide proletariat is
confronted with a dramatic lowering of relative wage as well as their real
wage, typically denominated “a lowering of the purchasing power” by Social
Democracy – as we pointed out in a previous note. We deem it crucial to
be perfectly clear on this question: this capitalist attack is a directly
worldwide phenomenon, an obvious concretisation of the “capitalist progress”.
It is not different North or South, East or West. It is not due, here to
the “lack of progress”, there to “the subprime crisis”, and elsewhere to
“corruption”. It is fundamental expression of the necessity of worldwide
bourgeois to hold in check the downward trend of the profit rate <i>by
increasing the exploitation rate on an international scale</i>.
<p>We have always affirmed it: never will commodity “unstarve” humanity.
Never will the capitalist society solve the problems of the human beings,
regardless of the governing bourgeois fraction, protectionist or neoliberal,
“right-wing” or “left-wing”. Nowhere on this planet will the merchant society
prevent hunger, wars, and the progressive destruction of the planet. On
the contrary, the merchant society appears ever more clearly as the society
exhausting Earth’s resources and condemning to exclusion, famine and death
a growing number of proletarians. The rising frequency of famines is indeed
a typical capitalist phenomenon (and not pre-capitalist!) that the merchant
society will never be able to avert. The price rise of energy and staple
goods is merely the epiphenomenon of a more global contradiction <i>between
capital and human species</i>, or even, <i>between the bourgeois society
and the Earth</i> (that is, all life forms on this planet and all vital
elements such as water, air, land…).

<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">Capital or Earth</font></u></h2>
Contrary to what our enemies say, the general price increase of the staple
products is not due to speculation. (7) Speculation is only the mechanism
that accompanies and intensifies the general trend of price increase for
food products, but in no way does it explain such increase. On the contrary,
it is the general increase of the value of such products that makes speculation
possible and profitable, and that generates an excessive increase of the
prices, beyond their actual value. Speculation is always based on goods
whose unitary value tends to increase, on goods whose demand predictably
will exceed supply. Nobody would be so dumb as to speculate on computers
or cell phones, since their unitary values keep decreasing. Indeed, the
production techniques of computers and cell phones are constantly improving,
so is the productivity of labour in those sectors, which entails both a
reduction of the price of such goods (due to the lower quantity of work
incorporated, hence a lower exchange value) and a rise in their availability
on the markets (the lowering of the value is compensated by a larger volume
of production). We have, therefore, a growing supply of computers whose
performance is always higher and whose price is always diminishing. The
capitalist that would try and speculate by hoarding devaluating goods would
be either mad or suicidal, but would for sure go bankrupt.
<p>Obviously, capitalists tend to speculate on goods which capital cannot
produce in unlimited supply, such as oil. Everyone knows that the worldwide
oil reserves are dwindling and that every new barrel extracted is requiring
more and more work. This situation inevitably generates an increase of
the price of oil, contrary to that of computers and cell phones. There
is no need to be a financial expert to realize that this trend is going
to be continuous, (regardless of some temporary drops due to State policies)
and that speculation on oil is very promising. Speculation is, let us remind
it, a “natural” expression of the life of capital, when circulating and
reproducing itself. But even if it can indeed momentarily exaggerate the
upward trend of prices, there will always be, in mid or long-term, a correction,
that is, a new drop. That is what is happening today with oil, and partially
with other natural resource related-goods, at the moment of concluding
this article. But it is crucial to distinguish a market-related phenomenon
from the fundamental determination of the value of goods, on the long run.
(8) Speculation is therefore not fundamentally the source of the upward
trend of price, and would actually be ineffective if the <i>intrinsic </i>value
of the goods didn’t rise as well. In other words, it is definitely the
real limits imposed to oil production and extraction, and the acknowledged
fact of its ultimate depletion that are responsible for the increase of
its value and invite speculation on this good.
<p>With regard to the price rise of agricultural goods, we believe that
speculation only amplifies the problem, but is not its original cause –in
the same way as it happens with oil. If capitalists speculate on agricultural
goods it is because they are well aware that their prices tend to rise,
all the more because the supply is not always sufficient to satisfy the
growing demand for such goods. The fundamental origin of the price rise
of agricultural goods is actually, in the same way as it happens with oil,
an increase of their value, which is a little more intricate to analyse
than the value of oil. A comprehensive explanation is more than this text
aims at. But we believe that, beyond appearances, the reasons are fundamentally
similar.
<p>The difficulty lies in the fact that the rise in price and value of
foodstuffs contradicts the general trend towards a reduction of the unitary
value of goods, due to the ever-increasing productivity of labour. It is
true that the incorporated technology keeps reducing the living labour
immediately necessary to transform raw material into finished articles,
and should therefore –theoretically- reduce their unitary value. But we
must not forget that the production of goods also requires raw materials
such as earth, water or oil, which cannot be produced at will –their quantity
is limited and they have been taken over by capital. We often ignore the
important part of the rent of land in determining the value of foodstuffs
(the price of land has significantly increased these last years) and we
also tend to forget that the dwindling of drinkable water reserves and
the impoverishment and erosion of the land (due to intensified exploitation
by capital) weaken land productivity, which invariably increases the amount
of work necessary to the production of foodstuffs, and hence the value
of such goods.
<p>In the text entitled “<i>Value, Price and Profit</i>”, Marx clearly
identified the natural conditions of labour and the state of the socially
productive labour force as being the two main and inseparable elements
on which the productivity of labour depends, and hence the value of the
produced goods:
<p>“<i>If the respective quantities of labour necessary for the production
of the respective commodities remained constant, their relative values
also would be constant. But such is not the case. The quantity of labour
necessary for the production of a commodity changes continuously with the
changes in the productive powers of labour (...). If, for example, in the
progress of population it should become necessary to cultivate less fertile
soils, the same amount of produce would be only attainable by a greater
amount of labour spent, and the value of agricultural produce would consequently
rise. On the other hand, if, with the modern means of production, a single
spinner converts into yarn, during one working day, many thousand times
the amount of cotton which he could have spun during the same time with
the spinning wheel, it is evident that every single pound of cotton will
absorb many thousand times less of spinning labour than it did before,
and consequently, the value added by spinning to every single pound of
cotton will be a thousand times less than before. The value of yarn will
sink accordingly.</i>” (9)
<p>Marx concludes: “(…) <i>the productive powers of labour must principally
depend:</i>
<br><i>Firstly. Upon the natural conditions of labour, such as fertility
of soil, mines, and so forth.</i>
<br><i>Secondly. Upon the progressive improvement of the social powers
of labour, such as are derived from production on a grand scale, concentration
of capital and combination of labour, subdivision of labour, machinery,
improved methods, appliance of chemical and other natural agencies, shortening
of time and space by means of communication and transport, and every other
contrivance by which science presses natural agencies into the service
of labour</i> (…).”
<p>Under the capitalist mode of production, it clearly appears that the
development of the second element (the <i>social powers of labour</i>)
tend, inescapably, to the destruction of the first (the natural conditions
of labour). Indeed, the extraordinary development of the capitalist <i>social
powers of labour</i> reached such heights nowadays that cultivable land
is becoming rarer and rarer, as are oil, drinkable water, and all other
“natural resources”, and, as a result, <i>the natural labour conditions</i>
are made less and less favourable to an increase of the <i>productive powers
of labour</i>. In other words, this means that the systematic increase
of the <i>productive powers of labour</i> of capital finds itself hindered,
checked by the <i>natural conditions of labour</i>. In spite of the means
that capital resorts to –by means of science, as Marx said- in order to
supersede these natural conditions, they end up imposing themselves sooner
or later. In spite of capital claiming its ability to submit all natural
conditions to valorisation, the production conditions remain irretrievably
bound to the earth –everything today is a blatant and catastrophic demonstration
of it. The tangible result of this separation between human activity and
nature is that capital is actually developing human productive activity
as a force that is hostile, antagonistic and destructive to Earth. On the
contrary, the communist revolution affirms itself as the reconciliation
of human activity with Earth.
<p>Indeed, agricultural exploitation, organised according to the immediate
needs of capitalist valorisation, demands an ever-increasing volume of
work, in order to make the land fertile, and implies therefore a price
rise of agricultural products. Furthermore, the permanent destruction of
cultivable land by capital (desertification, urbanisation, communications…)
leads to a rarefaction of land. (10) Of course, every ton of grain, rice,
potatoes, vegetables, may well contain less incorporated labour through
the various “technical” operations, from sowing to display on the supermarket
shelves, but, on the other hand, it undeniably contains an ever-growing
part of work made necessary by the preparation of land (to make it cultivable)
and for the obtaining of resources indispensable to production and distribution
(oil, water…). In addition, due to the growing rarefaction of cultivable
land, water, oil and other natural resources, the price paid for the use
of such resources –the rent- is always on the rise.
<p>As a matter of fact, the price rise for all products derived from land
(such as the mineral resources or those extracted from the seas) in 2007
until mid-2008 is fundamentally due to the same reasons that led to the
oil price rise. In each ton of rice, grain, meat, wool… there is a growing
percentage of value that derives from the rent of land and to the raw stuff
that is necessary to its production, compared to the volume of work immediately
necessary to its production. (11)
<p>In reality, capital has since decades tried its best to check this inexorable
trend towards foodstuffs price rise. As a matter of fact, capital produces
“food” that contains less and less natural components, less and less “land”.
Amadeo Bordiga was right when he stated, right in the face of all the idiots
in awe of modern science and technology, that our historical era will be
known in the future as “the age of junk”. This trend generates supermarket
junk food, fast foods, and is also responsible for the deliberately short
lifespan of every single device produced under the dictatorship of profit.
(12)
<p>It is important to emphasize that, for capital, the value reduction
of everything that is used for the feeding of the proletariat is also a
way of increasing the exploitation rate and hence, profit. If capital could
feed proletarians exclusively with cell phones and other plastic devices
(some of which would be labelled “hamburgers”, “chickens”, “salmons”…)
that incorporate less and less labour and “land”, it would gladly do so!
Also, regarding the rarefaction and increase in value of natural goods,
it is obvious that it is in capital’s interest to produce consumer goods,
destined to the proletarians, that require less and less of these natural
goods. Evidently, a supermarket “chicken”, insipid lump of gelatine clung
to a few bones, which kept the same name as a remotely related bird only
for a question of profit, contains a lot less human labour, but also “land”
(in terms of land surface, and biomass) than a farm chicken, or to a greater
extent, a chicken such as our grand-parents used to eat. In the same way,
its production requires a lot less time (a quarter to a tenth), depending
on profitability needs (the pace of rotation of capital). This is the sort
of value decrease that, in foodstuffs and more generally in everything
destined to proletarian consumption, has produced, for the last decades,
the greatest increase in the exploitation rate (surplus value divided by
variable capital) in the history of humanity. Due to this huge swindle,
a sleight-of-hands aimed at an accelerated and permanent substitution of
goods whose composition was still vaguely known by ersatz replacements,
always poorer, more synthetic and toxic, profitability conditions went
through the roof and offered capital a period of extraordinary development.
<p>As a matter of fact, in a more general way, the “junk food” is merely
a moment in the long and painful general historical process of dispossession
of the land that the human being has invariably been subject to from the
very beginning of the development of capital. This general process consists
in depriving the proletarians from the use of the land and in its privative
appropriation by capital. It is expressed through:
<ul>
<li>
the historical separation of the proletarians from the land in order to
turn them into workers freed from their survival means and forced to sell
their labour force to capital;</li>

<li>
repression, by all means necessary, of all populations still bound to the
land, through expropriation and/or by forbidding them to fish, hunt, pick
fruits…</li>

<li>
monopolistic and privative appropriation of all plants and seeds by capital,
among others through the development of GMO’s which modify the genetic
structure of plants and make them sterile – in effect privatising the very
reproduction of plants. More and more frequently, international corporations
lay claim over the properties of traditional plants that have been known
for centuries by indigenous populations. In order to achieve that, nothing
more is needed than picking a particular plant, study its composition,
change or add an element and take out a patent for the formula. As an example,
“Proctor” company, from Colorado, after a series of scientific manipulations
and administrative manoeuvres (including the due bribing of the appropriate
officials) took out a patent for the “frijol Amarillo mexicano” (yellow
bean) that has been consumed in Mexico for centuries, and demands, from
then on, about one dollar of royalties per kilo of “frijol” produced. Not
only does capital pursue its war to separate the human being from the land
by depriving him from his means of survival, but this process is currently
taking gigantic proportions, with the catastrophic situation of the present
society.</li>
</ul>
The whole development of capital is marked by the hellish contradiction
with the nourishing earth, whose animals in general and the human being
in particular are a constitutive element. From an ideological point of
view, capital enforces true “civilization” as total submission of the countryside
to the cities, superiority of “progress” against barbarity, of cement against
earth, of industry against agriculture and rearing. (13) Endless economic
growth is the supreme ideology of capital, which claims to be therefore
able to achieve total domination over the Earth.
<p>The whole history of bourgeois society is the history of the separation
of the human being from the land (that is still under way nowadays) and
of the bourgeois claim of prevalence over the natural relation between
Earth and Man as part of Earth and belonging to it. If this process still
goes on nowadays, it is clear that total separation of Man and Earth is
impossible. Although capital claims to be able to triumph over all limitations,
its actual capacity –that is to say, regardless of its wish- is limited.
<p>It is true that proletarians end up “feeding” on cell phones and other
crappy gadgets – an alienated satisfaction of alienated needs. It is also
true that it generates illusions about the durability of the current world,
especially if the proletarians keep being captivated by the ever-obsolete,
ever renewed catalogue of the same old junk, or if they get to the point
of recycling their garbage (the belief in the positive impact on the planet
of this unsalaried labour only helps perpetuate this system that precisely
destroys the planet) or go voting… But everything has a limit, and capital’s
true limit is the proletariat, that does not seem to agree on feeding on
cell phones and fast food, and insists on feeding on rice, grain, meat,
manioc, fish… all the more since it is starting to take to the streets
to shout this out loud.
<p>Capitalism will never be able to solve the problem of human feeding;
it is on the contrary continually aggravating it, and more globally, threatening
the very survival of the human species (and other life forms) on Earth.
The contradiction between capital and the survival of all living species
is sharpening and will continue to do so.
<p>Since capital has, for centuries, dispossessed Man from the benefits
of the land, the struggle against capitalism has always been, fundamentally,
a struggle to resist the separation from the land. During centuries Social
Democracy, obstinate worshipper of the myth of civilization, progress and
science, has looked down on the struggle of the rural proletariat to oppose
this separation. Social Democracy even theorized this racist ideology by
considering the urban industry worker more adequate to the revolutionary
struggle than his countryside brother. But in all major proletarian insurrections,
there is a powerful trend not only towards proletarian unification, but
also towards the connection of all most fundamental claims of the anti-capitalist
struggle –such as the abolition of private property- to the land issue.
As a matter of fact, urban proletarians and rural proletarians alike are
well aware that their struggle is intrinsically bound to the land issue,
(14) all the more because, first of all, that is what their feeding depends
on. All major revolutionary struggles of the XIXth and XXth century (Mexico,
Russia, Spain…) have equated the destruction of the bourgeois State, of
capitalism, to the human need of repossessing the land.
<p>Nowadays, proletarian reaction throughout the world is also fundamentally
a struggle of humanity to repossess the land against the dictatorship of
capital. The awareness of the protagonists notwithstanding, it is a revolutionary
struggle that has to assume itself as such: by asserting the necessity
of a social revolution, of the abolition of private property of the production
means, of the reunification of the human species with the Earth. We are
convinced that as this struggle exacerbates, the historical struggle of
humanity against the historical separation from the land also gain in importance.
<p>We can already witness, today, that in certain struggles, the proletarians
are starting to change the way they consider this historical resistance
and are starting to give more credit to the struggles of the “native”,
“indigenous” or “aborigine” peoples (that the bourgeois like to label “first
nations”) against capitalism and State. This evolution is very important
in the process that must lead to the unification of the struggles of the
proletariat against capital. As an example, under the influence of the
expansion of uprising movements, the Mapuche Indians show an increasing
trend to tie their struggle to the struggles of other proletarians that
confront the State in a similar way.

<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">Homogenisation, Unification, Associationism</font></u></h2>
The current situation of capital threatens everything that relates to the
mere survival, since the worldwide proletariat faces a brutal decreasing
of its salary, both relative and real, and consequently it faces a rising
exploitation. The proletarian struggles against that attack are definitely
the expression of the contradiction between capital and humanity, between
the dictatorship of profit and life on Earth. All these struggles are a
rebellion against capital, against the rising exploitation that in turn
brings a price rise for all consumer goods destined to the proletariat.
<p>Let’s go back to the basics: the qualitative and quantitative assault
against the survival of our species has no cause exterior to capital and
its logic. The greatest progress of capital can only be an aggravation
of this situation, the exacerbation of the contradiction between capital
and humanity, between the bourgeois society and the Earth. For capital,
the Earth itself is no longer sufficient: its needs in terms of valorisation
and the brutality, with which they are enforced, in too small a place for
its unquenchable appetite, are choking life itself, in a disaster whose
amplitude or acceleration we are not fully aware of yet.
<p>Today, there is no need to be a communist to affirm that without <i>changes
</i>in
this society, we are heading straight to the wall. But there are still
very few people who state that if capitalism is not <i>destroyed</i>, capitalism
will destroy the human species. Only communists affirm the imperative necessity
of a <i>dictatorship of the proletariat for the abolition of wage labour</i>
as an indispensable prerequisite for the survival of the human species.
<p>In spite of the proletariat finding it difficult to affirm its class
project, in great part due to the exacerbation of individualism in the
bourgeois society, we must point out that our class has already reacted
to the generalized price rise of first necessity goods in a much more unified
way than it is aware of. Indeed, the current attacks of capital have generated
a wave of proletarian struggles that involves nearly every country in the
planet. This clearly shows that the catastrophe of the bourgeois society
–that keeps exacerbating and homogenising the sufferings of the proletariat-
is a blatant reminder of the essential unity of the proletariat and can
only favour the trend towards the unification of its struggles.
<p>It is obvious that, from our point of view, the price rise of foodstuffs
produces an acceleration of this trend. Although we cannot prove this acceleration
in a “scientific” way and although this trend is not apparent at first
sight –all the more to the eyes of the atomized citizen- the unfolding
of the class struggles in 2007/2008 seems to us the most tangible expression
of this unification process. Our own international debate since our last
publications came out has actually been strikingly clarified by the realities
of the class struggle. Although the reconstitution of the proletariat as
a worldwide class would be too optimistic a conclusion, it is undeniable
that this historical process is starting to take shape.
<p>This trend towards the unification of the struggles of our class is
something that the bourgeoisie, obviously, seeks to cover up at all costs.
As we have already emphasized many times in this text, the bourgeoisie
is eager to conceal the fundamentally proletarian nature of these struggles
by categorizing them with a variety of labels: <i>suburban riots, hunger
riots of Third-World inhabitants, ethnic/religious conflicts, wage strikes,
liberation struggles of oppressed peoples, etc.</i> Of course, these dividing
ideologies are not the one and only reason why proletarians fail to mutually
acknowledge their respective struggles. It is obvious that the objective
conditions of life of the proletariat affect this non-acknowledgement.
If one of the aspects of the catastrophic reality of capital that we emphasized
in our editorial in the French review was indeed the growing number of
shantytowns and bleak suburban areas, we need to stress that the cramming
of proletarians in ghettos, and the various methods used to prevent them
to get out (police checks, scarcity of public transport, etc.) help fortifying
the ideology according to which, in the eyes of the rest of the proletariat,
those who live in the suburbs are nothing but scum, a sub-proletariat,
a lumpenproletariat. Urbanism is the organization of space according to
the needs of capital, to contain and repress the proletariat. This sneaky
policing appears to be an objective reality; it “naturalizes” the separations
and is, among the proletarians, a significant element in this subjective
and mutual non-acknowledgement of belonging to one and the same class.
Regarding these surplus proletarians that live in the suburbs, their isolation
and feeling of being left behind may generate, contradictorily, mechanisms
of communitarian withdrawal (religious or nationalist – in favour of their
original country) and/or of self-destruction (violence between proletarians,
mind-numbing use of drugs, (15) etc.), and, at the same time, a generalized
opposition to the system, expressed by a lack of illusions concerning its
promises of reform. These trends may make it more difficult for these proletarians
to express their solidarity with the salaried proletarians in their struggle
against work, because the latter embody a society from which they are excluded.
<p>It is obvious that the separations that are produced directly by the
bourgeois urbanism policies also take part in the current division among
the proletarian ranks and constitute, side by side with the ideological
separations put forward by the Social Democracy, a cordon sanitaire that
has a physical and straightforward material existence that stands in the
way of the affirmation of the essential unity of the proletariat. In all
these aspects of the life under the capitalist regime the bourgeoisie develops
continuously a whole arsenal of apparatuses, structures and mechanisms
–ideological or directly material- aimed at preventing, hindering or repressing
the process of unification of the struggle, depending on its level of advancement.
All these means are implemented with the fundamental objective of protecting
the capitalist order against the attacks of its gravedigger, the proletariat.
<p>Those ideologies, according to which the proletarians have distinct
and irreconcilable interests, are still considerably strong nowadays and
still hinder the mutual acknowledgement by the proletarians of the nature
of their respective condition and of their respective struggles. But fundamentally,
no bourgeois apparatus will ever be able to change the fact that every
proletarian struggle contains –and, we emphasize, to a certain extent,
expresses- the totality and unity of the project that makes the proletariat
“<i>the first exploited and revolutionary class in human history</i>”.
(16)
<p>For us, the ongoing unification of the proletarian struggles, as a matter
of fact, originates directly from the deepening of the capitalist catastrophe
and is not in the slightest the product of the action or will of whatever
party or revolutionary minority. (17) As we mentioned before concerning
the price of foodstuffs, the brutal capitalist attacks and the degradation
of the survival conditions that ensue are taking a global dimension that
are pushing towards a greater homogeneity of our class reactions, in terms
of timing, form and content. This is a major feature of the catastrophic
nature of capital: it digs its own grave, by forcing its executioner to
an ever more drastic reaction. It contributes steadily to the unification
of the proletarian struggles on a planetary level. Through the satisfaction
of its voracious appetite of profit and valorisation, capital simultaneously
and continuously threatens to discredit the ideological or material separations
painstakingly enforced among the proletarians to allow their exploitation.
It is clear that the bourgeoisie will find it harder and harder, with the
aggravation of the capitalist catastrophe and the expansion of the struggles,
to spread and maintain discord among our ranks, because the objective differences
in the way the proletarians are treated –material bases that contribute
to the division and lack of self-consciousness of our class- tend to fade
out. As we have stressed in the editorial of our French review, the bourgeoisie
seems aware that it will be facing an increasingly unified proletariat,
and it is doing its best to deal with it.
<p>As Marx already emphasized in “<i>Class Struggles in France</i>”, it
is indeed during the struggles against the capitalist attacks to which
it is submitted that the proletariat loses its illusions: basically, he
states that every proletarian defeat is simultaneously a victory inasmuch
as in the course of the struggle, the bourgeois schemes keep being exposed.
Only the expansion of the struggles gives the proletariat the strength
to break away, every time more sharply, with the separations enforced by
the bourgeoisie. This, we insist, is not initially a question of consciousness,
or party: it is the aggravation of the capitalist crisis that forces the
proletariat to fight and, in this process, to confront the class antagonism
with an increasingly radical way. The unfolding of the capitalist catastrophe
can only make clear and clearer the polarisation of society into two distinct
sides: the bourgeoisie and the proletariat.
<p>However, it is obvious that nowadays the simultaneity, the amplitude
and the clarity of the proletarian reaction cruelly contrast with the lack
of awareness regarding the revolutionary social project, in other words,
communism. It also contrasts with the lack of <i>mutual acknowledgement</i>
of those struggles <i>as originating, on a worldwide scale, from one and
the same class</i>. Nor does the proletariat realize the necessity of a
<i>stronger
organization</i> against our enemy. If the organic nature of the proletariat
is indeed more obvious than ever, as witnessed by the generalization of
the austerity policies to which it is subjected, if the focal points of
the struggle and its targets are indeed an expression of our worldwide
interest, the real centralization processes remain rare and isolated. The
lack of associationism, of programmatic statements, of continuity, of international
centralization, tightly linked to the destruction of the social bondage
that we referred to earlier in the text, keeps being the greatest gap of
the proletariat in its ability to carry on with the destruction of this
criminal society.
<p>From an historical point of view, our class is in a much different state
than it was, for instance, in the decades prior to the revolutionary wave
of the years 1917-1921. As a matter of fact, those days had seen the development
of a wave of proletarian associationism, in which the classist press acted
as collective organizer for millions of proletarians that assumed their
condition and claimed on a worldwide scale the necessity of destroying
the global capitalist society. Like we said above to stress our antagonism
against the “separation theories”, it would be wrong to take that historical
reference as an absolute criterion, and profess, wrapped up in the status
of “professional revolutionary” that “there is no consciousness”, that
“there is no organization”, that “there is no party”… as if we could draw
from the past some formal scheme to which the class struggle should conform!
Beyond the criticism of these Leninism-tainted caricatures, widely promoted
by the whole self-proclaimed “radical” Social Democracy, we must put this
absence of organisation and class consciousness into perspective:
<ul>
<li>
First of all, if it is obvious that if our class still doesn’t express
itself as a “self-aware class”, as an international subject struggling
for the abolition of the existing order, we must point out that everywhere
we can hear that “the causes are the one and the same”, that “the world
is wrong”, that “things can’t go on like that”. The relation between the
putrefaction of our survival conditions and the money world that oppresses
us is becoming more and more apparent. This is not exactly what revolutionaries
have always meant by “consciousness”, but it nevertheless expresses the
awareness that the worldwide system is “against us”, that its defenders
are “against us”.</li>

<li>
Next, a movement such as the one we witness nowadays conveys necessarily
some sort of consciousness level. This consciousness may express itself,
for instance, in the targets chosen: indeed, the attacks are directly aimed
at the bourgeoisie and its various organs, agents, and institutions, including
the social and humanitarian ones – in other words, those that overtly enforce
mass starvation as well as those who claim to save us from misery, whether
it be by means of ballot papers, wars against “exterior enemies” or generalized
resignation.</li>

<li>
Finally, it would be untrue to state that there is no associationism at
all, no organization with a superior degree of will and consciousness.
The intensity and constancy of the struggle in many countries is a clear
sign of organization in the action, in the demonstrations, in the clashes…
Once again, as we stressed several times in our publications, associationism
does exist but fails to maintain continuity. It develops rapidly and fades
away as soon as the movement declines. Furthermore, the brevity of its
manifestations prevents it from adopting international forms (in other
words, it does not assume the fundamentally international nature of all
proletarian struggles), and it does not sufficiently take into account
the revolutionary project.</li>
</ul>
The analysis of this situation with its positive and negative aspects is
for us of the utmost importance: if, on one hand, the generalization of
the struggles, their amplitude, their strength and our combativeness are
a certainty for the immediate future, our ability to triumph on a worldwide
scale is not guaranteed. The lack of class consciousness (that is to say,
of community of interest and aim) facilitates the distortions and falsifications
against our class struggle (and hence its isolation, essential step to
achieve impunity in repression) and opens the door to the loss of autonomy
of the movement, to its loss of substance by allying with bourgeois factions,
until the class struggle is turned into a inter-bourgeois clash. Whether
we manage, or not, to go beyond this contradiction between the amplitude
of the proletarian reaction and the lack of self-aware worldwide associationism
will be, in our opinion, a critical factor in the solution –revolutionary
or counterrevolutionary- to the global social contradiction. In addition,
at a time where the proportion of revolutionary minorities compared to
the existent movement of the proletariat is smaller than ever, <i>the struggle
against the current</i> of those minorities is, concurrently, more decisive
than ever.
<p>Let us single out an example among the current world events and reaffirm
the communist perspective. It is unquestionably true that the Pentagon
associated to other imperialist forces is acting against the Bolivian and
Venezuelan governments, as the bourgeois nationalist leftists are claiming.
However, considering the global crisis of the bourgeois system and its
attacks against the proletariat, and facing the proletarian struggle, the
action of the Pentagon coincides integrally and fundamentally with the
actions of all governments and leftists of the world, aimed at neutralizing
the current proletarian struggle against the social system by trying to
enlist the proletariat under bourgeois banners. In fact, the Pentagon and
the self-proclaimed anti-imperialist governments act jointly in the defence
of the same class interest: to eclipse the struggle that is unfolding throughout
the world against the price rise of basic commodities and to repolarise
the whole society according to the intergovernmental contradictions, on
one side the bourgeois nationalist governments of Latin America and on
the other the USA.
<p>Against this, the revolutionary action must affirm, as always:
<center>
<h3>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><font color="#FF0000">No solidarity with whatever
government or State!</font></font></h3></center>

<center>
<h3>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><font color="#FF0000">They are all enemies of

live the social revolution!</font></font></h3></center>
It is certainly not by accepting the polarizations between the different
bourgeois States and by turning into cannon fodder that we, proletarians,
will eat better, breath better… live better. On the contrary, we will do
so by fighting against capitalism and all its States, by constituting ourselves
as a class, as a party, by enforcing our worldwide revolutionary interest.

<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">Notes</font></u></h3>
&nbsp; This involuntary ambiguousness against the mechanicist conceptions
in our editorial was still accentuated by the nearly systematic use of
the expression “capitalistic decomposition” instead of “deterioration of
the contradictions” that we usually use to point out that we don’t expect
capital to fall apart before our eyes, but rather, that in the absence
of quantitative and qualitative development of the proletarian struggle,
the very real exacerbation of the contradiction between capital’s needs
and human needs will unfold to the detriment of our class: massacres, wars,
atomisation, exploitation, starvation, cops, prison, control, generalized
poisoning… We mean to affirm, as revolutionaries always did, that the catastrophe
is not only the capital’s future but also all its past and its present.
Moments of acceleration of this catastrophe are favourable moments to point
out the only real alternative, i.e. between catastrophe and revolution.
It doesn’t mean the end of class struggle (as in the mechanicist meaning
of “decomposition”) but on the contrary the moment where it really starts
to be decisive.
<br>&nbsp; Some comrades point out that “this icing on the cake” is not
something new and that it will undoubtedly be served to us in the future.
That is true, but it is also true that all innovations are nothing but
always more of the same, and that “progress” is nothing but a modernized
version of the worthless baubles that the colonizers offered to the natives
in return for the liquidation of their life.
<br>&nbsp; The expression “purchasing power”, as a reference to real wage,
i.e. the wage expressed in goods it allows to buy, is not innocent. It
is highly connoted and speaks for itself about how the state and in particular
Social Democracy claims that the measurement of “power” of our class boils
down to how full supermarket trolley is. If the value of the real wage
at any given moment always and effectively expresses a balance of forces
between the classes, a level of class struggle, on the contrary the purchasing
of commodities (and the prerequisite selling of our labour force) in itself
will never be the expression of a “conquest” or a “power”, but rather the
expression of our enslavement.
<br>&nbsp; For mere convenience we use these terms of “the left out” or
“the victims of social exclusion”, but it is clear that for us no one is
ever “left out” (in the sense of being “rejected” or “expelled” outside)
of the capitalist mode of production, of the world of wage labour. All
the proletarians are free workers, dispossessed of their means of subsistence,
forced to sell their labour force. In this general meaning, the lack of
work and wage income does not constitute an exclusion of the mercantile
society, but a further and even more violent bondage, the proletarian being
devoid of land or wage.
<br>&nbsp; Some subtler media, less inclined to the servile reproduction
of the Pentagon’s official versions, thus more frequent in Latin America
for example, make the distinction between (on one hand) the terrorism as
we describe here –consequently endorsing the anti-terrorist campaign of
the world state- and (on the other hand) the “guerrilla warfare” of “resistance
against the imperialism” of the USA such as in Iraq, Afghanistan, Colombia,
ETA in Spain… This constitutes a new media category, i.e. a partial acknowledgment
of the nature of these movements, but therefore also a subtler cover up
of this nature.
<br>&nbsp; All these ideological dimensions obviously materialize very
concretely against the proletariat, but they never constitute the material
basis of the social conflicts. They are nothing but shitty bourgeois polarizations,
a quagmire in which the proletariat loses its capacity to act autonomously,
when its struggle remains internationally limited and isolated.
<br>&nbsp; To blame all problems on speculation only, is to blame the problems
on a poor management, and thus equates to claiming that new policies could
change the situation. All that is done to neutralize the proletariat and
channel it towards participating in the elections.
<br>&nbsp; With the symbols of value, such as the dollar or the euro, the
same phenomenon is observed - a permanent fluctuation of their “value”
on the markets. However, in the long run, it is obvious that they will
lose value compared to commodities that have an intrinsic value.
<br>&nbsp; Karl Marx, “Value, Price and Profit,” New York, International
Co., Inc, 1969, edited by Eleanor Marx Aveling.
<br>&nbsp; We’re trying to give the term “land” its more general meaning
of “nature”, that is, the whole ecosystem that harbours life and the human
species in particular. It therefore does not only comprise land strictly
speaking, but also water, minerals, forests, seas, fauna and flora… and
everything capitalism calls “natural resources”. The whole planet has been
confiscated by capital and submitted to the dictatorship of profit rate
that jeopardizes the very life on Earth. The expression of this contradiction
is the class contradiction, in other words, the contradiction between the
persistence of capitalism and the persistence of life.
<br>&nbsp; Let us not forget that it is precisely because the amount of
land is limited (especially cultivable land) that the production of staple
food conflicts with other potential uses of land, such as animal food production
(that in turn may serve as food for humans) or biofuel-oriented production.
Indeed, the ecologist programme aiming at maintaining the current capitalist
World while substituting petrol with biofuel also contributes to the price
rise of staple food. But biofuel production is not the explanation of the
widespread price rise; it is rather another contributing factor and another
consequence of land rarefaction caused by capitalism. In addition, from
this point of view, capitalism made human food compete not only with animal
food, but also with automobile fuel consumption. Let us however remember
that the general reason behind the price rise of agricultural goods goes
beyond that, and this will not be solved either by forcing the proletarians
to feed on cereals in the same way animals are fed (as recommended by some
ecologists – in order to reduce our “ecologic footprint”) nor by discarding
biofuels.
<br>&nbsp; A noteworthy example of this trend aiming at reducing the quantity
of land involved in agricultural production is hydroculture. It allows
the rapid growth of water-drenched vegetables, resulting in an impoverished
denaturised product, hardly a compensation for its generally lower price.
<br>&nbsp; Let us emphasize that right from the beginning, the development
of class society brought along the affirmation of a superiority of the
sedentary people (cultivators and stock farmers) over the nomadic ones
(fishers, hunters, food-gatherers). This was backed by various ideologies
in order to establish the superiority of civilisation (particularly when
related to monotheistic religions) over all other human beings, going as
far as denying human status to coloured and indigenous people, and to all
those who had not been forced –namely due to prodigality of their natural
habitat- to resort to wide-scale agriculture and cattle breeding. The extermination
of the American Natives and generalized slavery have been justified by
this ideology of superiority of Agricultural peoples over those resorting
only to hunting, fishing or food-gathering. It would actually be rather
interesting to study the semantic evolution through which the word “culture”,
initially related only to the action of cultivating the land, has taken
up this positive meaning of “culture of the spirit”, and “human knowledge”,
as of the XVIth century. During the development of capitalism, this dislike
progressively grew up to a wider acceptance, being that of the whole of
the industrialized civilisation towards anything related to the land: superiority
of industry, science, and city over the countryside, over agriculture and
cattle breeding. The human being bound to the land is considered inferior
to the human being free to sell his labour force. This disdain and “racism”
appears unequivocally in many languages, typical vectors of ideology, in
which many terms that designate the man bound to the land have a highly
derogatory connotation: e.g. country bumpkin, yokel, peasant...
<br>&nbsp; How the struggle of the industry workers deals with the land
question is illustrated quite clearly by the Luddite movement – the machines
themselves were destroyed by workers dragged away from the land and forced
to submit to the rhythm of the machines that were viewed as an enemy entity.
The word “sabotage”, from the French “sabot” –clog- also conveys the contradiction
directly experienced by men that industrialization torn away from the land.
The clog, typical peasant shoe, was used to jam the machines by placing
into in the gearwheels.
<br>&nbsp; Enforcing drug use in our suburbs and other places where excess
proletarians concentrate is an old and widespread method of the bourgeoisie,
and has been condemned by all revolutionary groups. The present role of
the “pasta base” imposed on Latin America by the central and imperialistic
apparatuses of state, is a perfect example of an ultra violent means of
sedating the proletarians’ minds.
<br>&nbsp; As we developed in our publications in Spanish dealing with
the critique of Leninism, the keystone of Social Democracy, and in particular
its Marxist-Leninist variant, is the separation of the so-called historical
interests of the proletarians from their immediate interests, to have them
renounce to the first for the sake of the latter, that is, to put it simply,
to have them give up on all class interests. This allows our enemies to
enforce capitalist misery and ever increasing exploitation, in the name
of Social Progress and Revolution. Never must the proletariat renounce
to any of its class interests!
<br>&nbsp; For us, contrarily to Social Democrat conceptions, consciousness
blooms in the struggle and not the opposite. As far as the party is concerned,
it is not something “to be build” in order to “give the class the leader
it needs”. To state that the affirmation of the proletariat as a class
must be done outside and against all containment bourgeois organizations,
equates to saying that it organizes itself as a party, the party aiming
at the abolition of the existing conditions opposed to the party of order.

As we have asserted in the first article of this review, the international
proletarian revolt against worldwide capitalism has continued to unfold
over the last few months, as the bourgeois society continues to inflict
its catastrophic situation on the pauperised population of the planet.
In Greece, its expressions were struggles of the imprisoned, of the undocumented
immigrants, of the students, of the marginalized. These lasted many months,
until the generalisation of the struggle in December 2008. In doing so,
it anticipated what may and will happen in other countries, while giving
indications on the path to follow. In other words, this international and
internationalist protest against capitalism had been gaining momentum in
Greece, until the sweeping upheaval of December, triggered by the murder
of the young Alexis Grigoropoulos by the henchmen of this vile social system.
<p>The cells, the compartments, the segmentations that capitalism had erected
everywhere, through all sorts of go-betweens aiming at negating the proletarian
struggle, were shattered by the very proletarian movement, although only
in this country and in culminating moments of the struggle. This happened
because proletarians took to the streets not only as such: i.e. workers
or unemployed, natives or foreigners, students or shanty-town dwellers,
young (even kids!) or elderly people, men or women, documented or undocumented,
hooded or openly, pupils or teachers, “peasants” or city-dwellers, but
precisely because the movement, resorting to all available means (flyers,
Internet, pamphlets, newspapers, and so on) explicitly denounced all these
categorizations with which the historical enemy insulted and sought to
dismember and liquidate this extraordinary and generous social movement.
<p>The first expressions of this movement to spread throughout the world
proclaim: “<i>Who is behind the revolt? Whose actions, deeds and movements
keep and grow its flame? The anarchists? The students? The immigrants?
The unemployed and the humiliated? The youths from the rich Northern and
Southern suburbs? The gypsies? The hooligans? The workers? To all of them
and many more belong the actions that shape the unstoppable lava that was
awaken when the unthinkable murder of Alexis that shook all of Greece took
place on Saturday night.</i>” (3) Beyond the limitations contained in these
first written manifestations, they go up against all that the media are
trying to convey, because they claim this revolt belongs to all.
<p>During the course of the French suburbs riots disparagement and affronts
were given a free rein, even to the point of insulting, in the name of
the proletariat, the very proletarians that had risen up. In Greece the
bourgeoisie resorted to all available means to discredit the riots or reduce
them to a question of particular social categories. However, the movement
succeeded in ridiculing these efforts, and even in exposing the lackeys
of the State for what they were. The media, voice of our enemies, proclaimed,
as always, that we were “only” dealing with a bunch of anarchists, hooligans,
young people, whose sole purpose was indiscriminate violence, but the generalisation
of the riots, and the proclamations that asserted its proletarian and revolutionary
nature, left no room for doubt among the proletarians not only in Greece,
but in other countries too. The proclamations made it clear that it was
not a matter of replacing a rightist government with a leftist one, of
discarding one government programme to implement another, or to change
the government so that the situation is back to normal. Quite the opposite,
this very normality, this very daily routine, was denounced by the proletarian
riot for what it was: salaried slavery and permanent blackmail. The movement
yells its truth in the face of the counterrevolutionary falsifications.
<p>It had been a long time since the proletariat in the heat of the battle
had professed so unambiguously its revolutionary goals. A pamphlet from
our comrades stated: “<i>We are part of the revolt of life against the
daily death the existing social relations impose on us.</i>” (4) It went
on saying that: “<i>We erect a steadfast barricade against the loathsome
normality of the cycle of production and distribution. In the current conjunction,
nothing is more important than consolidating this barricade against the
class enemy. Even if we retreat under the pressure of the (para-) state
scum and the insufficiency of the barricade, we all know that nothing will
ever be the same in our lives.</i>”
<p>What a wonderful affirmation of the proletariat as a class! What a terrorising
(for the bourgeoisie) reassertion of the proletarian struggle to abolish
the social system, and the dominant class! “<i>We also position ourselves
in the historical conjunction of the recomposition of a new class subject
that carries from long ago the promise of assuming the role of the gravedigger
of the capitalist system. We believe that the proletariat was never a class
because of its position; on the contrary, it constitutes itself as a class
for itself on the grounds of the clash with the bosses, first acting and
only later gaining consciousness of its actions.</i>” (5)
<p>The proletariat is reborn when it takes to the streets. The proletariat
defines and moulds itself in the confrontation with capital, the very revolutionary
theory is reasserted by vanguards’ expressions. The very concept of proletariat,
ever falsified, sociologified, often reduced to the sole industrial workers
and systematically emptied of its social counterpoint dynamics by the counterrevolution,
is reclaimed by our comrades: the proletariat constitutes itself in the
confrontation with capital! The proletariat stands as a force against the
ceaseless blackmail of wage labour.
<p>When it was no longer possible to conceal the generalisation of the
riots, neither on the national nor on the international level, our old
enemy went on to explain, through all the media available, that the “rightist
government had made mistakes” and that “it should step down”. But uncountable
communiqu&eacute;s and proclamations were issued to denounce that vile
lie.
<p>“<i>Politicians and journalists brag around, trying to impose on our
movement their own failing rationality. We would revolt because our government
is corrupted or because we’d like more of their money, more of their jobs.</i>
<br><i>If we break the banks it’s because we recognize money as one of
the central cause of our sadness, if we break down shop windows it’s not
because life is expensive but because commodity prevent us from living,
at all cost. If we attack the police scum, it’s not only to avenge our
dead comrades but because between this world and the one we desire, they
will always be an obstacle.</i>” (6)
<p>How critical it is for the ongoing struggle that the proletariat does
not mistake its enemy for such or such government, or party. Its enemy
is not even all governments and parties as a whole, but money, capital,
the social relations of production! In spite of all anti-terrorist campaigns
set up by all the states in the world in order to consolidate their own
monopoly of terror, the proletarians in Greece who took to the streets
yelled in the heat of the battle: “<i>Wage labour is the real terrorism!
No peace for the bosses!</i>”
<p>The uprising of the proletariat in Greece has lit up the whole world;
not its positive proposals, but its radical critique of today’s society
without requesting anything from the power in place, which obviously is
what most terrified the bourgeois worldwide power at the international
level. We quote the revolutionary expressions of the proletarians in struggle:
“<i>The insurrection of December didn't put out any concrete demands, exactly
because the participating subjects daily experience, and therefore know
the denial of the ruling class to meet any such demand. The whisperings
of the left that initially demanded the removal of the government were
replaced by a mute terror and a desperate attempt to relieve the uncontrollable
insurrectionary wave. The absence of any reformist demand whatsoever reflects
an underground (but still unconscious) disposition toward a radical subversion
and surpassing of the existing commodity relations and the creation of
qualitatively now ones.</i>” (7)
<p>Contrarily to other countries (where the proletariat does not take to
the streets when it should, when undocumented immigrants and prisoners
are being repressed, when overtly racist acts are committed) the strength
of the movement in Greece is based on the fact that the bourgeoisie and
its various apparatuses has not succeeded in isolating the sectors of the
proletariat that, well before December, had initiated exemplary struggles
that resonated in the whole country, and abroad. We are referring to the
sectors that are most repressed on a daily basis –the prisoners, the undocumented
immigrants, the immigrants, the youth, and “nonconformists”- but more globally,
to all proletarians in irregular and precarious situations, poorly paid,
who undoubtedly sparked off the movement.
<p>The proletariat in Greece has proven its vigour by not shying away from
expressing solidarity with those sectors that were radically confronted
to capitalism and the State. Indeed, it was the struggle of the prisoners,
the undocumented immigrants, and the marginalized that resonated through
the whole proletariat as its very own, and originated in the movement.
Already in November 2008, the struggle in the prisons spread out, with
more than 7,000 of the 12,000 prisoners taking part in a series of organised
protests (among which the hunger strike that started on the 3rd of that
month). (8) The bourgeoisie proved unable to keep the struggle in check,
and the protest spilled through the streets, as evidenced by the radicalisation
of the demonstration of November 17th. (9) Small groups carried out direct
action throughout the month of November. Actions were undertaken against
repressors and also against all forms of citizen surveillance, such as
destroying surveillance cameras in many strategic places. At that time,
the struggle reached out for abroad and constituted a first call to international
solidarity. Within the scope of this very movement came the struggle of
various groups of immigrants and undocumented immigrants who also started
a hunger strike, along with other demonstrations and actions (such as the
occupation of the city hall of Chania). This gave a new impulse to the
proletarian movement that was demonstrating violently in various cities,
and particularly in Athens, on December 5th. Soon not a day would pass
without struggles, and everyday the Athenian democracy responded repressively,
leading to the murder of Alexis, which was the straw that broke the camel’s
back.
<p>From that moment on, nothing would be the same. We cannot produce a
detailed chronicle of the movement, but we can highlight some of its synthetic
elements:
<p>“<i>From the first moment after the murder of Alexandros, spontaneous
demonstrations and riots appear in the centre of Athens, the Polytechnic,
the Economic and the Law Schools are being occupied and attacks against
state and capitalist targets take place in many different neighbourhoods
and in the city centre. Demonstrations, attacks and clashes erupt in Thessaloniki,
Patras, Volos, Chania and Heraklion in Crete, in Giannena, Komotini, Xanthi,
Serres, Sparti, Alexandroupoli, Mytilini. In Athens, in Patission Street
– outside the Polytechnic and the Economic School - clashes last all night.
Outside the Polytechnic the riot police make use of plastic bullets. On
Sunday the 7th December, thousands of people demonstrate towards the police
headquarters in Athens, attacking the riot police. Clashes of unprecedented
tension spread in the streets of the city centre, lasting until late at
night. Many demonstrators are injured and a number of them are arrested.
From Monday morning until today the revolt spreads and becomes generalized.
The last days are full of uncountable social events: militant high school
students’ demonstrations ending up -in many cases- in attacks against police
stations and clashes with the cops in the neighbourhoods of Athens and
in the rest of the country, massive demonstrations and conflicts between
protestors and the police in the centre of Athens, during which there are
assaults in banks, big department stores and ministries, siege of the Parliament
in Syntagma square, occupations of public buildings, demonstrations ending
in riots and attacks against state and capitalist targets in many different
cities.</i>” (10)
<p>Other accounts of the movement, which were circulating on the Internet,
describe how unstoppable was the splendid proletarian fury, how relevant
was the choice of its targets:
<p>“<i>All of us together with our differences we write history and we
shake the whole planet. This revolt not only will not stop but is intended
to spread across Europe and the whole world. In this framework, we can
comprehend the panic of the State. But nothing can forgive or justify or
make bearable the incredible, unmatched orgy of violence that it continuously
sets off. How much rather when this violence is not recorded or when it
is unbearably distorted from the media. Our comrades have suffered unjustified
beatings, pupils are beaten mercilessly, fascists make use of their weapons,
secret cops act out of control, immigrants have their lives threatened
but for the media there is only burned shops and “criminal” looting. Unlucky
for them what is left is old aged housewives and the rest of little scared
men like the finished fascist followers. Our rage for all them has no limit
and from now on they should be careful. The rebellion turns the impossible
to possible. It is the dream that wakes up when the never-ending nightmare
before ends. Because comrades, what we lived in the Western suburbs, Athens,
the whole world, was a nightmare. In an ugly city to spit every day on
our misery, to kill our imagination, to be scared of our neighbour, to
remain helpless in our incapability being bombarded by made up advertisements
that make us believe that we are worth for what we have and not who we
are.</i>
<br><i>Alexis, we are ashamed of you because it took your blood us to wake
us up from the nightmare and live the dream of life. But if we are ashamed
of you, the others should be fearing you with a fear that paralyses their
guts. First of all the cops that dress up like revolting people to abduct
pupils and take them to the dungeons of central offices. NO MERCY FOR THEM.
THEY CAN’T HIDE FROM US. Their punishment is coming and no State can save
them. You are the ones that spread the worst catastrophism, the vile defeatism,
the insane fear and all that just to save your skin. You will not save
it. But it is not only you that do all the above. ALL the parliamentary
parties live in distress and are dying to diffuse the revolt. The lower
middle class people that cannot think of their life without their little
shop. Dehydrated existences that only live for their money income; they
also have their fears of existence. They don't have to fear us that much.
Apart from those who actively and openly help the murdering State, the
rest will be left to their unbearable misery. And well done to those of
them that went further than them selves and took part in the events on
the right side. As much as it is suppressed, they are not few. But we wrote
enough for the lower-middle class.</i>
<br><i>History is written now from other powers and those powers will strengthen
their presence overwhelmingly in the next days. After six days of colossal
battles, fatally TODAY is the start of the second round with new heights
and landmarks to reach. (…) The pupils that have suffered the worst kind
of police brutality will be there, the students of the 2006-7 revolts will
be there, the unemployed that fight against depression and humiliation
will be there, the workers who lately look at their boss with a different
eye will be there, the immigrants who for years know what dictatorship
means will be there, we, from the Western suburbs who for years are torn
by the most ridiculous regionalisms, will be there. WE WILL ALL BE THERE.</i>”
(11)
<p>It is true that besides this rejection, this negation of the world,
besides the movement’s stunning comprehension of the necessity for a social
revolution that is the necessity to destroy totally the capitalist system,
this manifesto also developed further much vaguer and weaker expressions.
<p>“<i>We are accused that our rebellion is inarticulate, blind, and reactive.
That we don’t know what we want and what we don’t want, yet. That we are
thieves and destroyers. Well then, we know what we want and we don’t want.
We don’t want cops paid to terrorize teenagers. We don’t want chemical
war that blocks our lungs and blinds our eyes. We don’t want riot police,
bodyguards, pimps, parasites, bouncers, professions of violence and force.
We don’t want polluted air, and burned forests, concrete that kills the
earth. We don’t want prisons that annihilate the individual, absurd laws
about cannabis, cameras that supervise life in order to protect inanimate
property. In this draft of manifesto for life after the revolt we ask and
shall impose.</i>
<br><i>1) Liberation of the wider centre of Athens from cars. City for
pedestrians, bikes and children.</i>
<br><i>2) Transformation of the destroyed banks to asylums for the poor,
libraries and free internet points as well as coffee shops as in Amsterdam.</i>
<br><i>3) Transformation of police departments into kitchens that would
offer natural food, free of charge to whoever asks and is in need of.</i>
<br><i>4) Copyleft all intellectual, informative material as well as free
1gbps internet with modern optic fibres.</i>
<br><i>5) Stop the use of oil and natural gas and replace them with high
tech solar energy beehives and other completely recyclable energy sources.</i>
<br><i>6) Assaults to all the covered from the police whore houses and
release of the forced prostitutes. Positive recognition of the feminine
sexuality as a right that will be practiced by choice. No mercy to rapists
and paedophiles. No humiliation to those who enjoy their sexuality in different
way provided that they do not do it by using force.</i>
<br><i>7) Assaults in prisons and release of everyone unless they have
been proven to be related with crimes of pederasty, rape, racism and white
slavery.</i>
<br><i>8) Priority to children and their needs for play, love, tenderness
and joy.</i>
<br><i>9) Free infrastructure; educational and medicinal with simultaneous
restriction of arbitrariness and power of those working there. Responsible,
open, friendly relationships between doctor-patient and pupil-teacher.</i>
<br><i>10) Free transportation and encouragement of the use of bikes in
the city, while expanding trains across the country.</i>
<br><i>These are roughly what we want and will achieve. Maybe some others
equally essential are absent but those mentioned are not a few nor negligible.
We know that our movement not only has acquired world interest but it has
taken to inspire a global revolt. As we drew upon the 10 rough points of
“what we want” it was under serious consideration.</i>”
<p>It would be a lot easier to discard such propositions or to ridicule
the narrow scope of such claims. However, in this listing of issues that
emerged from discussions and assemblies, we highlight, before anything
else, the total rejection of the present world, through the enumeration
of what “<i>we do <u>not</u> want</i>”. The rejection, the negation, constitutes
the starting point of every revolutionary movement. We reaffirm that this
negation does not beg for anything to anyone, not even to the State. It
aims at enforcing itself. These expressions have the huge merit of starting
from the essential understanding that in order for things to change it
will be necessary to resort to violence in order to bring down the authority
of the state and replace it with something else. The movement’s desire
to turn the speculation and repression centres (banks, police stations…)
into something useful to mankind is something positive, although it is
hard to fathom how such thing could ever be achieved. Finally, it is worth
noting that the protagonists see these claims (which, in reality, amount
to not much) solely as immediate measures, that they are not negotiable
and that further and more critical issues will have to be dealt with later.
<p>Yes, it is true that this manifesto contains a variety of illusions
distinctive of any burgeoning and heterogeneous movement, encouraged by
circumstances and ideological pressure to express hastily positive solutions
and having yet to affirm its strength of negation of the whole existing
society. This is why some solutions appear, which are somewhat illusory
on the means considered to change what most affects them in their immediate
lives, without uprooting the whole system of exploitation. It is also true,
that in these expressions can be felt the harmful influence of ideologies
such as are fashionable among leftists and environmentalists, whose reformist
obedience inevitably reduces the scope of the movement. These have been
and will be limitations that the next proletarian movement will be confronted
with, but the most important is not the content of these timid immediate,
and very often reformist (although some may sound quite appealing) immediate
measures, but the inherent negation of all that currently exists, the violent
confrontation against the whole capitalist world defended by leftists,
centrists or rightists.
<p>Finally, it is worth noting that point 7, to storm the prisons and release
all the detainees (beyond some limitations in the formulation), does not
match the others, since it is not something that should be aimed at, but
rather it is a crucial expression of the movement, although at this stage
it doesn’t have the strength to shoulder it. It is an important objective,
but for the time being out of reach. Unlike all others it stands overtly
against the democratic and legal structure of private property and bourgeois
domination and by doing so presents a clearer rupture with reformism.
<p>In this historical epoch of so much division within the proletarian
movement, the most significant feature of the struggles in Greece is, as
we have mentioned before, the strength that the movement displayed in prevailing
over the fragmentations and compartmentalization so crucial to the bourgeois
domination. Against official contempt, against the racism inherent to capitalism,
against the good citizens, the proletariat shouldered the defence of its
interests, rallying under its banner the prisoners, the immigrants, the
youth and all other sectors that are usually kept isolated. If they often
had to face, alone, the coalition of all bourgeois forces, in December
their joining together and taking to the streets kindled a beacon-fire
in Greece, whose powerful flame could be admired by the proletarians throughout
the world.
<p>Far from ignoring the problem of racism and other segmentations permanently
used to maintain the capitalist domination and oppression, (12) the movement
faced them for what they are, and many discussions and communiqu&eacute;s
dealt with the matter of the immigrants and foreigners. Class consciousness
asserted itself among other things against the ever-present divisions,
and the protagonists made it clear that they fought side by side with the
local proletarians as well as with the immigrants and refugees.
<p>“<i>In the framework of this wider mobilisation, with the student demonstrations
being its steam-engine, there is a mass participation of the second generation
of migrants and many refugees also. The refugees come to the streets in
small numbers, with limited organisation, with the spontaneity and impetus
describing their mobilisation. Right now, they are the most militant part
of the foreigners living in Greece. (…) The children of migrants mobilise
en mass and dynamically, (…) this is a second French November of 2005.
(…) These days are ours, too. These days are for the hundreds of migrants
and refugees who were murdered at the borders, in police stations, workplaces.
(…) They are for Gramos Palusi, Luan Bertelina, Edison Yahai, Tony Onuoha,
Abdurahim Edriz, Modaser Mohamed Ashtraf and so many others that we haven’t
forgotten. These days are for the everyday police violence that remains
unpunished and unanswered. They are for the humiliations at the border
and at the migrant detention centres, which continue to date. (…) These
days are for the price we have to pay simply in order to exist, to breathe.
They are for all those times when we crunched our teeth, for the insults
we took, the defeats we were charged with. They are for all the times when
we didn’t react even when having all the reasons in the world to do so.
They are for all the times when we did react and we were alone because
our deaths and our rage did not fit pre-existing shapes, didn’t bring votes
in, and didn’t sell in the prime-time news. These days belong to all the
marginalized, the excluded, the people with the difficult names and the
unknown stories. They belong to all those who die every day in the Aegean
sea and Evros river, to all those murdered at the border or at a central
Athens street; they belong to the Roma in Zefyri, to the drug addicts in
Eksarhia. These days belong to the kids of Mesollogiou Street, to the unintegrated,
the uncontrollable students. Thanks to Alexis, these days belong to us
all.</i>” (13)
<p>With these words, issued in Europe, historical centre of colonialism
and racism, the struggle of the proletariat in Greece proclaims the internationalism
of the proletariat as a class. The opposition between the present and future
world could not be clearer, between the world of capital with its racism,
its wars, its slavery and massacres and a society rid of inhumanity, brought
forth by the proletariat and its revolutionary struggle.
<p>It is true that, as often before, the movement stemmed from specific
sectors of the proletariat. As witnessed by the protesters, when it embarked
on a radical course after the murder of a youngster, the streets were filled
mostly with youngsters, nearly kids (this had also happened in France,
in the suburbs’ riot and during the anti-CPE struggle). Of course, as always,
the protagonists initially viewed this as a problem, but continuity and
generalisation (including geographically) of the struggle eventually transcended
it. Such reassertion of the proletariat as a class generated an interesting
intergenerational exchange of communiqu&eacute;s. We emphasize some noteworthy
elements, in which some “kids” produce a sound and constructive critique
of the conformism of the adults, basically, their own parents. Here in
the box is the letter handed out at Alexi’s funeral, written by his classmates
(the words in capital letters were like that in the original letter).

<p>This communiqu&eacute; circulated a lot, in Greece as abroad, and obviously
many could not but denigrate its authors, but there were also a number
of replies who wholeheartedly agreed with it, calling for all proletarians
to join the fight, and this is what we want to emphasize. (14)
<p>Of course, as in other occasions, some sectors of the proletariat failed
to act, stuck in front of their televisions and digesting unmoved the ideological
venom that produces good citizen. There will always be proletarians who
will betray their class and act as silent accomplices of their own repression,
as pointed out by the pamphlet of the “kids”. It was not the bourgeois
who went to repress and kill the proletarians in struggle. The bourgeois
were hiding in fear. Class domination is based on the ability of the ruling
class to enlist part of the proletarians in order to repress the other
part.
<p>In Greece, as we have seen, the protagonists not only globally denounced
the cringing citizen, but also whoever balks at taking sides or fails to
break away from the citizen demonstrations organised by the leftists and
the trade-unions.
<p>“<i>The owners of the commodity labour-power who had it invested in
the stock exchange of social security and in the hope of seeing their offspring
exiting this condition through social ascension, continue to observe the
insurrectionary party without taking part, but also without calling the
police to dissolve it. Along with the substitution of social security with
police security and the collapse of the stock market of class movability,
many workers, under the burden of the collapsing universe of petit-bourgeois
ideology and the state hybris, are moving toward a (socially important)
moral justification of the youth outbreak, but without yet joining the
attack against this murderous world.</i>
<br><i>They kept on dragging their corpse on three-month litanies of the
professional unionists and on defending a sad sectional defeatism against
the raging class aggressiveness that is rapidly coming to the fore. These
two worlds met up on Monday, 8/12, on the streets, and the entire country
caught on fire. The world of the sectional defeatism took the streets to
defend the democratic right of the separated roles of the citizen, the
worker, the consumer, to participate in demonstrations without getting
shot at. Nearby, not that far away, the world of class aggressiveness took
the streets in the form of small organized "gangs" that break, burn, loot,
smash the pavements to throw stones onto the murderers. The first world
(at least as expressed in the politics of the professional unionists) was
so scared by the presence of the second, that on Wednesday, 10/12, attempted
to demonstrate without the annoying presence of the ‘riff-raff’. The dilemma
regarding how to be on the streets was already layed in: Either with the
democratic safety of the citizen, or with the clash solidarity of the group,
the aggressive block, the march that defends everyone's existence with
sharp attacks and barricades.</i>” (15)
<p>Many of the movement’s expressions denounce, rightfully and violently,
all those who, although shocked with Alexis’s death and peacefully demonstrating
in protest, yet submit totally to the dominant ideology and collaborate
with the ruling class on an everyday basis.
<p>Proletarians from sectors where their jobs are less threatened, and
who, very often, enjoy the highest trade-union protection, are always the
most conservative. For the most part, they are, with their ideas and illusions,
an obstacle to proletarian solidarity and combativeness. Beyond those who
actually enjoy a “privileged” position within the production apparatus,
the average good citizen is a key asset of the counterrevolution. The left-wing
bourgeois parties are crucial to the construction of that ideology. In
Greece as in other countries, these parties are strongly rooted in the
above-mentioned sectors and always take stand against the communist struggle.
The occupation of the headquarters of the <i>General Confederation of Workers
in Greece</i> by the <i>Assembly of Insurgent Workers of Athens</i> constituted
a stunning act of defiance against the tutelage of these leftist counterrevolutionary
forces and dismissed many media lies. This edifice, permanent bastion of
the bourgeois order, paid by the proletarians, briefly reverted to the
latter’s control, and its repossession was a head-on confrontation against
the counterrevolutionary containment attempts of the trade-unions. Beyond
the mere taking over of the building, it was highly symbolic of the struggle
against the trade-unionist apparatus and bureaucracy, as emphasized in
the present communiqu&eacute;:
<p>“<i>To flay and uncover the role of the trade union bureaucracy in the
undermining of the insurrection -and not only there. GSEE and the entire
trade union mechanism that supports it for decades and decades, undermine
the struggles, bargain our labour power for crumbling, perpetuate the system
of exploitation and wage slavery. The stance of GSEE last Wednesday is
quite telling: GSEE cancelled the programmed strikers’ demonstration, stopping
short at the organization of a brief gathering in Syntagma Sq., making
simultaneously sure that the people will be dispersed in a hurry from the
Square, fearing that they might get infected by the virus of insurrection.</i>”
(16)
<p>However, during this bold direct action, two classical tendencies confronted
each other, as it is always and everywhere the case: on one hand the left-wing
of Social Democracy only criticizing the union bureaucracy, and on the
other hand those who get to the root of the problem by criticizing the
very essence of the union as an apparatus of capitalist oppression:
<p>“<i>From the beginning it was obvious that there were two tendencies
inside the occupation –no matter how clearly articulated: a workerist one,
that wanted to use the occupation symbolically in order to criticize the
trade unionist bureaucracy and promote the idea of an independent of political
influences base unionism; and a proletarian one, that wanted to attack
one more institution of capitalist society, criticize syndicalism and use
the place for the construction of one more community of struggle in the
context of the general unrest.</i>” (17)
<p>Obviously unionists and their shock troops couldn’t allow such an affront
from the revolutionary proletariat. That day, they tried to recover the
premises by force. In order to achieve this, they called out more than
50 henchmen who tried to throw out the occupants, but the latter resisted
and thanks to the occupants of ASOEE, they succeeded in postponing the
eviction till around 3 p.m. To reaffirm the occupation, calls to gather
around the building were issued, which materialized a few hours later with
around 800 people taking part.
<p>In spite of all these efforts we must admit that our enemies’ endeavour
bore fruit, and that from the vast numbers of proletarians in the streets
in those days of fighting, few were those who had clearly broken away from
the trade-unionist bourgeois tutelage. Many workers of the heavy industry
were spectators rather than protagonists, meaning that they failed to take
on the struggle that their comrades from the vanguard were urging them
to join. This proved a significant limitation to the scope of the revolt.
However, when the crisis deepens, even job security, that is so central
to securing conformism, starts to totter. Then, the proletarians of the
large companies end up breaking free from the trade-unionist tutelage (and
Social Democratic ones generally speaking) and may play a major role in
the struggle. By the way, we deem it relevant to make a comparison with
the proletarian revolt in Argentina in 2001/2002, when the crisis had reached
such proportions that even those sectors took to the streets, which was
generally not the case in Greece. As a matter of fact capitalism has yet
to launch in Europe a head-on strike on all these sectors, which for the
time being makes it possible for all the State apparatuses (and in particular
the trade-unions) to continue keeping the proletariat divided. In spite
of what is known today as “the crisis”, the capitalist catastrophe in Europe
has primarily hit the weakest strata of the proletariat (young people,
immigrants, undocumented immigrants, and marginalized people in precarious
situations). Consequently, they have spearheaded all the main struggles
on this continent. This may be a reason for the difference with the characteristics
of the struggle in Argentina. In Greece, judging from the outburst and
the insurrectional pattern, the movement seemed set on laying it all on
the line. In Argentina the movement lasted much longer, but much greater
was the infestation by political illusions (Constituent Assembly, classical
reformism, Argentinean flags, and so on) and above all by managemental
trends (self-management, productive cooperatives set up by the jobless,
and so on). These plagues were the main internal factor of the liquidation
of the movement. In Greece the ideology conveyed by Negri (or Holloway)
or the fashionable Comandante Marcos, who want to change the world without
settling the power issue, hardly impacted the movement. It issued an outright
challenge to the ruling class (in the Argentinean-style “<i>Que se vayan
todos!</i>” – Out with them all!). It affirmed explicitly its insurrectionalist
objectives and was only and ultimately held in check by its isolation,
in other words, by the fact that without the proletariat from other countries
joining the struggle (at least the other European countries, as stated
in the pamphlets) it was not possible to go any further.
<p>Here too the vanguard sectors showed great lucidity: “<i>We know that
the time has come for us to think strategically. In this Imperial time
we know that the condition of a victorious insurrection is that it spreads,
at least, on a European level. Those last years we’ve seen and we’ve learnt:
The counter-summits worldwide, students and suburban riots in France, the
No-Tav movement in Italy, the Oaxaca commune, Montreal’s riots, the offensive
defence of the Ungdomshuset squat in Copenhagen, riots against the Republican
National Convention in the USA, the list goes on.</i>
<br><i>Born in the catastrophe, we’re the children of all crises: political,
social, economical, ecological. We know this world is a dead-end. You have
to be crazy to cling on its ruins. You have to be wise to self-organize.</i>”
(18)
<p>The appeals from Greece proliferated arouse solidarity with the proletarian
revolt in Greece throughout the world:
<p>“<i>The explosive events right after the murder caused a wave of international
mobilization in memory of Alexandros and in solidarity with the revolted
who are fighting in the streets, inspiring a counter-attack to the totalitarianism
of democracy. Concentrations, demonstrations, symbolic attacks in Greek
embassies and consulates and other solidarity actions have taken place
in cities of Cyprus, Germany, Spain, Denmark, Holland, G. Britain, France,
Italy, Poland, Turkey, USA, in Ireland, Sweden, Switzerland, Australia,
Slovakia, Croatia, Russia, Bulgaria, Rumania, Belgium, N. Zealand, Argentina,
Mexico, Chile and elsewhere.</i>” (19)
<p>There were significantly more repercussions and displays of solidarity
than for other instances of revolt these last few years. We hope that this
is a sign that however dormant the proletariat was, the catastrophic current
situation of the bourgeois society and the riposte of the proletarians
in Greece have been a vital shake-up that is starting to awake it (to the
great apprehension of the bourgeoisie). Have we reached a turning point
towards the end of class unawareness, a point where no one will ever feel
indifferent to the ever more daily catastrophe and this valorous struggle
against the system?
<p>Of course, these international direct actions must be taken as models
and opposed to bourgeois leftist alternatives of ever, that merely caricature
solidarity (actually, that try to deflect, or prevent it), encouraging
peaceful demonstrations, petitions, harmless carnivals, or humanitarian/charity
campaigns.
<p>Is it necessary to remind that real, strong, and organized class solidarity
still doesn’t exist, that what do, we proletarians from everywhere else
in the world, to support an extraordinary movement such as this, is totally
insufficient.

<tr>
<td><b>One of the biggest difficulties for the proletariat everywhere in
the world is the “what’s to be done?” in order to snatch, after each small
conflict or big battle, our fellow prisoners from the clutches of repression.
Under the current international balance of forces, the inability of the
proletariat to carry through this necessity on class grounds is obvious.
Our failure to forcefully release our comrades from detention through direct
action is used as an element of permanent blackmail, which democracy and
its agents systematically resort to in order to force us to follow their
rules. According to those rules, the individual is left isolated to face
the state, the citizen faces the legal apparatus alone, and no other “defence”
is possible but the individual defence on legal grounds and based on “solidarity”
– sending material aid to help endure the hardships of detention, prepare
the trial and pay the lawyer… The tricky discussion on how to face each
concrete situation must not make us lose sight of the fact that the bourgeoisie
exercises the dictatorship not only when it imprisons our comrades but
also when it enforces the rule of law and leaves us nothing but this individual
defence as a citizen. The citizen’s rights, widely advocated by our enemies,
always involve a component of state terror that is used to oppose the organization
of the proletariat in force.</b></td>
</tr>
</table></center>

<p>But, as we already developed, important and courageous that the direct
action of the international proletariat may be when in solidarity with
the struggle of the proletariat in a region, the genuine solidarity is
the intensification of the struggle against the bourgeoisie wherever it
is. The ultimate expression of solidarity will be when, from all parts
of the world, the proletariat will simultaneously take to the streets,
and confront one and the same enemy. Only then will social revolution be
possible, as expressed by many internationalist groups.
<p>“<i>Comrades, let’s follow the example of our brothers in Greece, unchecked
by all democratic integration attempt. Beware of the tricks democracy pulls
out to try and fool us. All the politicians in the government or in the
opposition, left- or right-wingers as well, the repressive forces, journalists
and other heralds of capital… all of them are expressions of the capitalist
beast: i.e. spare parts, alternatives, false oppositions and tools to crush
us. It’s the whole world we want to change right from its foundations.
And for this, we rely only on ourselves, by getting organized outside and
against all the apparatuses of the state (parties, unions, NGO’s, etc.),
breaking away from the divisions they want to impose upon us (youngsters
vs. oldsters, workers vs. students or unemployed, immigrants vs. natives,
etc.).</i>” (20)
<p>From Rosario in Argentina the claim is the same – real solidarity means
to struggle everywhere against capitalism, and to confront our “own bourgeoisie”:
<p>“<i>Why react to these events, which take place so many kilometres from
where we try to live our lives? Because, exploited and oppressed, we have
no homeland: patriotism serves the ruling class in its hiding of the social
antagonism, we are living in, it’s the alibi to divide the dominated, in
order to deprive them from their class identity. Because we were, we are
and we will be those who stand against this form of non-life, we support
those who drive the revolts in Greece forward, as an affirmation of life,
destroying what destroys them (and what destroys us), retrieving the food
produced by our brothers, occupying universities in order to get together,
confronting the police, reclaiming the streets, acting outside and against
parties and unions, showing us that the real organization is built from
below. ‘Workers, unemployed, students, hooded’ are categories used by the
bourgeois medias to isolate and divide. We say: ‘All proletarians! So,
let’s struggle and get organized against ‘our’ own bourgeoisie in ‘our’
own region…</i>” (21)
<p>And even from the Czech Republic (“the little putrefied pond of social
peace” as some comrades described “their” own country), calls for solidarity
and proletarian action were issued:
<p>“<i>Is economy in crisis? Let’s finish it off! Down with social peace!
One Greece is not enough!</i>
<br><i>Sooner or later, capital will leave us with no reserves. We will
suffer and maybe we will die, if we will continue to slavishly accept wage
labour and money as a necessary means to satisfy our needs. But surely
there will be proletarians, who will refuse the logic of exchange value
and surge into supermarkets and take without paying, what they will need.
The class movement in Greece will explode anew with even greater subversive
power and this time it will not be alone. And it will not be only proletarians
in China, Bangladesh, Egypt or Bolivia, who will rise up. Even over here,
shop windows will be trashed. We will loot shops and luxurious bourgeois
haciendas. Mass strikes without and against trade unions will subvert all
the capitalist economy. The state with its police and army will, as always,
defend bourgeois order and properties and make terror against the proletariat,
who will never solve anything, unless it makes its own revolution. In the
meantime, all our support, sympathies, thoughts belong to proletarians
in Greece, who struggle or are imprisoned. We long for helping them through
spreading the struggle in the Czech Republic and the whole world. We want
to share and develop their experience with them, in order to put a global
revolutionary insurrection back on the order of history…</i>” (22)
<p>Proletarian class unawareness in Europe and worldwide keeps pushing
down with all its weight, preventing this simultaneous outburst of proletarian
violence that is so critical to make a riot turn into an international
social revolution. Obviously, without this generalization, as our comrades
from the ASOEE said (see their communiqu&eacute; already quoted), there
is a point when, due to the correlation of forces, momentum will be lost.
It is a saddening thought, and nonetheless realistic, that sooner or later
and despite our efforts to maintain and expand the movement, things will
revert to normality. It is an important fact, because one of the factors
that hobble the movement is the idea, according to which “the insurrection
should be sustained for as long as possible”. As a matter of fact, we have
read communiqu&eacute;s on the Internet that advocated this. (23)
<p>The internationalism of the proletariat is still limited to these few
actions, vital and exemplary, such as carried out by a small minority of
groups that in various countries took to the streets to lend support to
the revolt in Greece, attacking symbolic targets, representations of State,
handing out pamphlets, proclamations and appeals to join the fight to the
dormant proletariat that in other countries “watch” what (our enemies claim)
“is going on in Greece” through the caricaturing and castrating images
on TV. Tragically, sedatives and other ideological drugs are still effective
and prevent the spreading of the fire. Indeed, this time, a lot more happened
than during other proletarian revolts such as the ones that occurred in
Iraq, Algeria, and Argentina. There was also a feeling of recognition at
the international level that created an atmosphere contrasting with the
one of a world class that very often seems buried. In the militant discussions,
in assemblies, in publications, in bars, on Internet… we can see that a
large number of proletarians, who a few times ago were yet sedated with
idiocies, ideologies and pacifism, somehow identified themselves with this
great violent expression of our class. Even though one could sense an embryonic
re-emergence of this feeling of belonging to one and the same class opposed
to the world of capital, we cannot say that there was an international
extension of the proletarian revolt.
<p>This extension is not prevented by a lack of internationalism among
the proletariat in Greece. On the contrary, it is the unawareness of internationalism
from the proletariat in other countries that sets the objective limits
of the Greek revolt. In Greece the proletariat did all it could to break
its isolation, and its actions were internationalist in essence. They brought
light to all our proletarian brothers that in those actions could see their
potentiality, the grandeur of the revolution they announced. Furthermore,
not only did the proletariat in Greece, in its actions and proclamations,
call its brothers to join the fight, but in the midst of the struggle it
clearly expressed, through concrete acts, its internationalist solidarity
– with the proletariat in other countries, not only with foreign proletarians
fighting in Greece. As a matter of fact, there were pamphlets and actions
in Greece directed against the terrorist repression, conducted in those
very days by the State of Israel (and the USA), of the proletariat in the
Gaza strip. This shows that against the terrorism of the international
State there is no solidarity but through the use of force and direct action.
<p>Concerning this, we would like to emphasize something critically important.
During the revolt in Greece, proletarians realized that the USA were supplying
the criminals of the Jewish State with military equipment that transited
through the port of Astakos, and fought to interrupt the traffic. This
is the report of “<i>Voices of Resistance from an occupied London</i>”:
<p>“<i>Mainstream media reports have revealed that the U.S. Navy is attempting
to ship 325 20-foot containers of ammunition (over 3000 tons) from the
private Greek port of Astakos to Israel, in an emergency shipment of arms
to aid the occupation in its ongoing war crimes against the Palestinian
people in Gaza. Information as for when this shipment will be attempted
is conflicting; possible dates are the 15th, 25th and 31st of January.
(…) groups and individuals (…) are organising for a national mobilisation/blockade
of the port of Astakos: the anti-authoritarian movement, the anti-war internationalist
movement and Astakos’ local assembly of groups and individuals have already
issued statements calling for a gathering at the port of Astakos on Thursday,
15.1.</i>” (24)
<p>Some days later, the state of the United States informed its Israeli
counterpart that the shipment had been cancelled under an unknown pretext.
But with proletarians in struggle in Greece, in Palestine and in the world,
we knew that our enemies would rather cancel the shipment (maybe hoping
to organize it in some other way) rather than maintain it, as by doing
so they would confront the international proletarian solidarity and prompt
a sharp class against class violence at the general level. This reaction,
in turn, would have been an objective element prone to raise the consciousness
of the proletariat at an international level. This is what they fear most:
evidence that the revolutionary struggle of the proletariat alone can stop
wars, repressions and state-led massacres, which would ridicule all pacifist
speeches and demonstrations.
<p>There’s one last question: what is left of the revolt in Greece? Let’s
quote once again these clearheaded protagonists of our class:
<p>“<i>Everything begins and matures in violence – but nothing stops there.
The destructive violence that unleashed in the events of December caused
the blocking of the capitalist normality in the centre of the metropolis,
a necessary yet insufficient condition for the transforming of the insurrection
into an attempt for social liberation. The destabilization of capitalist
society is impossible without paralysing the economy – that is, without
disrupting the function of the centres of production and distribution,
through sabotage, occupations, and strikes. The absence of a positive,
creative proposal for a different form of organizing the social relations
was –up until now- more than self-evident. Nevertheless, the insurrection
of December must be understood within the historical context of an enlivement
process of class struggle that takes place on the international level.</i>”
(25)
<p>At the time of conclusion of the present text (February 2009), the struggle
of the proletariat in Greece was going on, although, of course, in a more
limited way. After a phase of road and highway blockades mainly led by
the agricultural proletariat, occupations and especially assemblies are
going on. Political structures and groups are taking stock of what happened
and are drawing lessons and giving instructions for the next explosion,
which is as unavoidable as the catastrophe of capital.
<p>Nothing will be the same anymore, neither in Greece nor elsewhere. The
comrades who were in the street in Greece have many lessons to draw and
to pass on for the fights that are on the way in the whole Europe and all
over the world. May our present contribution go in this direction!

and published in our review “Comunismo” No.59 (May 2009) as well as in
French in “Communisme” No.61 (June 2009) under the title: “It’s going on:
Greece”. For this late publication in English, when new struggles are occurring
in Greece against the austerity measures imposed by capital, we changed
a little bit the title to precisely express this continuity in the struggle.

in Greece during the movement of December.
<br>&nbsp; Extract from the leaflet “Nothing is Over – We are only the
beginning – Statement” issued by assemblies (found on UK Indymedia) and
displaying a high level of spontaneity and innocence as for the goals of
the movement that we comment on further.
<br>&nbsp; “We destroy the present because we come from the future. Communiqu&eacute;
from proletarians of the occupied ASOEE,” already published in our previous
review in English “Communism” No.14 (January 2009). We would like also
to emphasize how these comrades are directly in line with what we wrote
in the introduction of our “Theses of Programmatical Orientation” (note
No.2): “Despite all the difficulties presented by formal-logical and bourgeois
language, we are trying to express, in the most precise possible way, the
subject of revolution at the same time as our concept of communism. For
us the concept of communism is not an ideal to be applied, but the movement
of destruction of the society of capital and the society resulting from
this practical negation. (...) Against the current of dominant ideology
and at the risk of shocking, we can state, if we put ourselves at a higher
level of abstraction, that it is not communists or the proletariat which
turn social movement into communist movement but, on the contrary, it is
communism as a historical movement which, for the first time in history,
finds in the proletariat a truly revolutionary class capable of imposing
communism as an effective negation. It is communism which co-opts the most
historically decisive elements of the class, those which always put forward
the interests of the whole of the proletariat as the leadership of the
party and the Revolution to come.”

<br>&nbsp; At each anniversary of the “fall of the dictatorship,” demonstrations
are organized, but this year, thanks to the prisoners’ struggle, they intensified
and solidarity with these rebels was proclaimed, which was its climax.

<br>&nbsp; The worst aspect of racism is the one present in the very essence
of the capitalist social relations, which makes the labour force of a national
white worker worth much more than the labour force of a black and/or a
foreigner. This is all the more pernicious when this reality is denied
on the grounds of an “antiracist” ideological discourse.

<br>&nbsp; This is a completely absurd version of “insurrectionalism,”
according to which everything is insurrection. This pretty fashionable
current undermines the essence of proletarian insurrection, while identifying
it with any form of direct action. To advocate “insurrectionalism” without
the critical qualitative leap that destroys the power of the dominant class
amounts to negating the necessity of a proletarian revolution and always
turns out to be a waste of energy. “Insurrectionalism” concretely stands
in the way of the social revolution, which requires the liquidation of
capitalist power and the enforcement, by means of revolutionary violence,
and different social organization. More precisely, the proletarian insurrection
is the necessary qualitative leap in terms of concentration, organization
and centralization of proletarian force against the bourgeois power that
will turn the generalized revolt into a social revolution. Therefore, the
many self-proclaimed “insurrectionalists” who make an indiscriminate use
of the word “insurrection” are definitely not acting for the real insurrection.
