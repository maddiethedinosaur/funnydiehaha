<h2>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Our reviews</font></h2>
We publish our central reviews (in French, Spanish, Arabic, etc.) as part
of our efforts aiming at centralizing militant activities and proletarian
struggles at an international level. Our reviews are not simply brochures
giving information or publications of propaganda and we do not want to
"convince" individuals for whom the necessity of the struggle against the
order of capitalist exploitation and bourgeois state oppression is exclusively
a "theoretical question". We are proletarians who are exploited and oppressed
like any other proletarians, who are forced, by the totality of our situation,
to fight, to organize ourselves against the bourgeois order.
<p>Our reviews are means, products and parts of this fight and are for
proletarians who, starting out from our common situation of being exploited
and oppressed, starting out from the class hatred against the exploiters
and oppressors and from the class solidarity for our brothers, are trying
to find the way of common fight.
<p>Another important feature of our central reviews is the fact that -
due to their general level of globalisation and abstraction - they become
an explicit reference in the history of our class, i.e. just like communist
militants today use the material that was passed on to them by previous
generations of militants, in the same way today's material that we elaborate
will also be an element of clarification and reinforcement for communists
tomorrow. In this sense, the existence of our central reviews does not
depend on the present situation of the proletariat.
<p>But it is easy to understand that as far as our real possibilities and
the concrete means to publish such reviews are concerned, we depend entirely
on the present (and past) situation of our class. As a matter of fact,
it is clear that it would be irresponsible to decide to publish a review
in this or that language (arguing about the historical necessity of it)
without considering the real (immediate and potential) possibilities one
has for turning such a publication into a REGULAR means for the centralization
of communist activity.
<p>Why the English language review is a special case?
<p>For the reviews in French and Spanish, and in a nearly uninterrupted
manner since the creation of our group (1978) practically all the concrete
possibilities have been existing to publish them: continuous militant activity
of the group using these languages; a relatively large number of militants
and contacts involved in these activities and real possibilities to distribute
them. For the English language review, at least some of these aspects are
non-existent, or questionable (*).
<p>During the last years we had to realize that the situation - with regard
to these criteria - has become much less favourable, much more difficult
for us... and of course, such a recognition of the real state of affairs,
of the real state of our situation, our forces, should be linked up with
the general state of isolation and weaknesses that we live in and that
our movement is going through (has been going through for the last decade...
and more!). We had to check very carefully and very precisely what necessities
we are facing and what possibilities we do have.
<p>For sure, wherever we have travelled, wherever we have met other comrades
whose language we did not speak and who did not understand French or Spanish,
we nearly always managed to communicate in English. Comrades in other countries,
such as Germany, Norway, India, Taiwan,... nearly always relied on English
to get in touch and communicate with us. This undoubtedly is due to the
fact that English today is the privileged language, the first international
language for the communication of capitalist transactions (in finance,
commerce, science,...) and that consequently in most countries the imposition
of English as a second language is considered by the local States to be
a worthwhile investment.
<p>So the necessity of an English language review, as a means for ourselves
to contact militants in many different areas of the world, as a means and
agent for the centralization of international struggle, has clearly imposed
itself on us as an absolute necessity.
<p>Compared to this necessity, our possibilities to assume such a publication,
on this particular (high) level of abstraction, are really weak. They are
weak in regard to the requirements for such a review (its quality) as well
as in regard to the very limited means that we really dispose of: inside
our group there are no comrades for whom English is the mother tongue,
and outside the group, there are only few sympathizers that we can count
on to help us with the translations.
<p>Finally, we agreed that in spite of these difficulties, we really need
the English language review, as it is a means of opening some (though limited)
new perspectives, too. The group should act, also concerning these questions,
in historical perspective, and judge the importance of its actions on the
basis of this historical approach. The aspect of concrete English language
activity is weaker (but not non-existent), but the potential perspective
is much more important.
<p>We need the review in English to maintain and improve our contacts with
fighting proletarians and to have chance to make new contacts by the means
of circulating our review, wherever it is possible. We cannot just wait
for a greater demand for a review in English, we should contribute to the
development of a real demand for if. We want the review in English to be
a possible means of breaking out of the general state of isolation and
weaknesses that we live in and that our movement is going through.
<p>We are expecting all our comrades ("readers") to contribute to the task
of reading, criticising, and spreading this review, as well as to the task
of translating, writing, etc.. We need the comrades' contributions and
we consider it our task, among others, to organize these contributions.
We are aware that this will be one of the main conditions for our activities
with the means of this language to become more real.
<p>(*) This, of course, does not mean that as far as the French and Spanish
reviews are concerned, we do not encounter such difficulties. But it is
true that for reasons related to the "personal" history of the militants
of different origins who are responsible for these publications, that the
difficulties we are mentioning regarding the <i>Communism</i> review have
less effect on the group's capacities to assure regular publications in
these two languages. To have a better understanding of how we organise
the political centralisation, the homogenisation of the contents of our
publications in different languages, we refer to the editorial we published
in <i>Communism</i> No.5.

<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">The capitalist necessity for war</font></u></h2>
Capitalism cannot live without war. It is not by chance that war permanently
exists in this or that part of the world, it is not by chance that it is
generalizing. The reason is: this society cannot live without war.
<p>War is nothing else but an inevitable expression of private property
of the means of production, freedom of trade and competition.
<p>Moreover, looking through the historical development of Capital and
the consequent exacerbation of all the contradictions, we can see that
this system only grew up thanks to successive wars and that the cycle it
needs to survive is: crisis, war, reconstruction, expansion, new crisis,...
and so on. Concretely, capitalist progress and development are made possible
through barbarity and war.
<p>Briefly explained, the reason for this is that the mass of capital grows
more quickly than its possibilities of valorization. Thus comes a time
of overproduction of capital, which leads to the situation that part of
the worldwide social capital is excluded from the valorization process,
by and on the benefit of another part of the same worldwide social capital;
the conditions for a new valorization process will only be regenerated
from and on the basis of a violent devalorization of a part of capital;
or, to put it in a better way, on the basis of the fact that part of capital
stops working as such (bankruptcy or physical destruction of the means
of production).
<p>Closing down factories or putting part of constant capital on the rubbish
heap, as it happens daily through the "normal" application of the law of
value, are never enough. That's the reason why regularly a generalized
depression takes place and leads to a generalized devalorization of all
existing capital, capital that does not meet any possibility of profitability
and must "normally" lead to generalized bankruptcy of the less profitable
capitalists. This is a question of life or death for the latter (as well
as all the others) to resist this inexorable law of Capital. That's how,
for example, the profitability of a sector can be altered on the basis
of protectionism,... which only leads to pass its own sentence on other
capitalists. The organization of capitalists, on different levels of centralization,
aiming at leading and aiming to lead this war with the best possible conditions
(societies, cartels, national States, imperialist blocs,...) periodically
gives birth to war: this war is a partial solution to the problems of worldwide
capitalism. Beyond the fact that wars develop as interimperialist struggles
to seize means of production and markets; beyond the fact that in the consciousness
of part of the bourgeois this war looks like a war against other bourgeois
(which it is as well); war, as a matter of fact, through the destruction
of an important part of world capital, improves the general conditions
of valorization of the whole of the international social capital.
<p>This is the reason why it is a reactionary utopia to want to stop war
while keeping this society that generates war. To stop the run for war,
it will be necessary to give up the economic capitalist development; to
stop the barbarity that capitalist progress means, it will be necessary
to stop the development of bourgeois economy, that of national production,
etc. Capitalism <u>is</u> reproduction, growth, development,... this is
the reason why only the destruction of capitalism will suppress wars.
<p>The more Capital develops, the more the whole of its contradictions
and atrocities develop; more progress and growth means more depressions,
crises, necessities of new wars. The criminal role of those apologists
of development and progressive clerics becomes clear.
<p>As to peace that follows war, far from being the real negation of war,
it only exists as part and product of the latter, as momentary and unstable
formalization of a given correlation of terrorist forces, a correlation
that other terrorist forces will inevitably consider as unfair and imposed
by violence, and thus a pretext for a future war.
<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">The proletariat and the communist revolution:
the only alternative</font></u></h2>
The only and unique total and radical negation of war is the total and
radical negation of the worldwide bourgeois society. This negation is the
international communist revolution.
<p>While the bourgeois solution to the crisis of society can only be a
partial solution, the communist revolution is the general solution par
excellence. While only war -with peace, reconstruction and, in the best
case, the expansion they mean- can boost a new infernal cycle towards a
new depression and a new war, social revolution appears as the unique alternative
able to break once and for all from the permanent barbarity of war.
<p>But, as bourgeoisie only is the class that represents Capital and embodies
its historical agent, proletariat is the historical agent of the revolutionary
negation of Capital, the historical class of the social revolution.
<p>Bourgeoisie is the one that enforces all determinations of Capital and
cannot escape from any of them. The struggle for the maximum profit, the
competition, the commercial war and war as such are as essential to this
class as breathing is to human beings.
<p>On the other hand, whatever illusions proletarians may have about improving
their lot in this society, or about war, proletariat as a class is historically
forced by its own social situation to deny the whole of capitalist society,
to impose through revolutionary violence the destruction of the society
based on the dictatorship of profit, competition and war; it is historically
forced to make the worldwide revolution.
<p>Communist revolution is not an alternative among alternatives, it is
the unique alternative to this society of misery and permanent war. In
this sense the contradiction: war/revolution is just an expression of the
contradiction: capitalism/communism, an expression of the antagonism between
bourgeoisie and proletariat.
<p>This is where our Party's invariant position against war and for revolution
comes from. This position is expressed in our thesis 26 (Cf. Theses of
programmatical orientation):
<blockquote><i>"<u>Workers have no homeland</u>, one cannot take away from
them what doesn't belong to them. Any form of defense of the nation, under
whatever pretext, is an attack against the worldwide working class. Under
the reign of bourgeoisie, all wars are <u>imperialist wars</u> opposing
two or more factions or groups of interests of world capital. Proletariat
launch and claim only one war: the social war against the whole bourgeoisie.
Independently of the direct intentions of the protagonists, the essential
role of wars is to affirm Capital and to smash objectively and subjectively
the subversive class within this society. In this sense, wars are never
merely wars between National States, between the forces of "national liberation"
and the "imperialist" forces, or wars between "imperialists", they are
essentially <u>wars of Capital against communism</u>.</i></blockquote>

<blockquote><i>Opposed to all interbourgeois antagonisms between "progressive"
and "reactionary" factions, "fascist" and "anti-fascist" factions, "left
wing" and "right wing" factions,... the logical consequences of which are
imperialist wars, the proletariat has no other solution but the intransigent
struggle against all sacrifices (against all truce, all national solidarity):
<u>revolutionary
defeatism</u>, turning its weapons against its "own" direct exploiters,
against its "own" direct oppressors. The proletariat's aim is to transform
(for the international centralization of this community of struggle against
Capital) capitalist war into a revolutionary war of the world proletariat
against the word bourgeoisie."</i></blockquote>

<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">The development of the antagonism between
war and revolution</font></u></h2>
The more Capital developed, the more it developed its barbarity, its historical
antagonism against humanity, and, by this, the historical agent of this
antagonism: the proletariat. The more national economy progressed, the
more it transformed itself into an economy of war; the bigger the growth
of the notorious Gross National Product is, the stronger the military production
is, not to mention that all big progresses are made within the military
sector. All this meant even more sacrifices for the human beings (but isn't
it precisely this humanity we are asked to sacrifice on behalf of the economy
and the nation?!?), even more negation of the human necessities of the
proletariat.
<p>War in itself, the open declaration of the hostilities, contrarily to
what pacifists say, is by no means a change of nature of bourgeois society;
it is by no means a break from its progress; it is only the most natural
result of economic development, of competition, of social and interbourgeois
peace.
<p>On the other hand, from the point of view of humanity, war means a qualitative
step in the antagonism between Capital and the human being, between bourgeoisie
and proletariat, between war and revolution. To schematize, let's say that
the reasons are:
<ul>
<li>
because war means the destruction of the means of life and of life itself,
which is just another exacerbation of the general antagonism between the
capitalist rapport of production (that overwhelm and... humanity) and the
productive forces of humanity.</li>

<li>
because war means that the realization of bourgeois interests means denying
the proletariat as a class; the affirmation of economic nationalism and
imperialism means the slaughter of the proletariat.</li>

<li>
because war supposes a general level of general exacerbation of relative
and absolute misery of the proletariat as well as an exacerbation of all
social contradictions; because the more Capital needs social peace and
national adhesion, the more it requires national unity, the more obvious
the contradiction becomes between the interests of the nation, of capitalism
and its war and those of the proletarians sent to the slaughterhouse.</li>

<li>
because war is always the war of destruction of the proletariat, because
those sent to kill and die are proletarians, because in the affirmation
of people in war, the subject of the communist revolution itself is destroyed.-
because of all these reasons, the proletariat is more than ever forced
to fight, to take over and to recognize its historical antagonism with
bourgeois society, because in a period of open war, the smallest defence
of interests of the proletariat (although it's about its bread, its life,
the life of its sons and comrades) is considered to be an attack against
the national state (which, in fact, it is), a betrayal of the fatherland
(idem),... and because the struggle against its immediate enemy, "its"
recruiting officers, "its" bourgeoisie, "its" state has only one alternative:
the revolution and directly is on the terrain of the universal struggle
of the proletariat against war and for revolution.</li>
</ul>
This is confirmed and concretized all throughout history. The highest moments
of the universal revolutionary struggle have always been linked to the
struggle against imperialism, since the proletarian movement in Paris during
the Commune up to the international revolutionary wave of struggle of 1917-1919,
not to mention the war and revolution in Spain in 1936-1937. This can be
seen also in the fact that when counterrevolution is total and national,
war can carry on its work of general destruction, as it did during the
Second World War, for instance.
<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">Interimperialist war, war against the proletariat</font></u></h2>
Imperialist war is often opposed to war against the proletariat. Even revolutionary
militants are frequently involved in controversy to determine if the function
of war is the struggle between bourgeois, between national States or against
communism.
<p>As we said it before, we consider this a false polemic, a false opposition.
In reality, every national war in the capitalist system is at the same
time an imperialist war and a war to destroy the proletariat. This needs
some more explanation.
<p>The point is not that each faction of the bourgeoisie, when going to
war seeks to destroy the proletariat or to provoke a general devalorization
of capital to improve the general condition of valorization. These factions
generally go to war to destroy the enemy they are in competition with,
to take over their competitors' means of production and/or markets, to
prevent the devalorization of their own products by taking over part or
the whole of their enemy's means of production. But, while considering
all this as objective facts and beyond the consciousness of those who enter
into the war, it is important to see that they realize the immanent tendency
of capitalist production to destroy the productive forces of Capital (means
of production and labour force), provoking this way the devalorization
of capital that will later make reconstruction and valorization of the
rest of world capital easier, destroying at the same time the real subject
of communism.
<p>To put it more clearly, let's consider the basis of capitalist society.
Capitalist society cannot exist through simple reproduction, as we have
already said it; it cannot exist without the development of the productive
forces, without the constant revolution of the mode of production. The
slightest historically-empirical observation enables us to understand that
technological progress is part of the life of Capital. Nevertheless, from
the point of view of the whole, from the point of view of the social capital,
it does not improve the conditions of profitability; on the contrary, inasmuch
as it is concretized by (<b>or</b> as it takes shape in) an increase of
the organical composition of Capital (we don't take into account here the
case of a development of the technical composition of Capital thwarted
by a reduction of the composition in term of value), technical progress
would tend to a reduction of the world rate of profit if there where no
conditions thwarting this law (such as the increase of the rate of exploitation).
The question will then be: why do capitalists impulse technical progress
if it tends to reduce the average rate of profit and to devalorize the
existing capital (an increase of the productivity of labour does not only
reduce the value of what's going to be produced, but also the value of
what has already been produced, according to the fact that the value is
not the time of labour required to produce something, but the time of labour
required to produce it again, to reproduce it?
<p>The answer is: the essence of Capital is competition, anarchy and opposition
of capitals; Capital only is a whole of opposed and struggling capitals;
it is not "Capital in general" that economically decides, but each capitalist,
each specific faction of capital; of course, all of them are interested
in technical progress since on the basis of that they can make "extraordinary
surplus value". Indeed, each individual capitalist or (which, at a certain
level, is the same) each faction of Capital increasing the productive force
of labour it exploits, obtains a time of labour of the produced commodities
lower than the time of labour of the mass of the same article produced
within the average world social conditions. That is to say, what is wrongly
called "the individual value" is then higher than its social value. Of
course, the real value of a commodity is not its individual value but its
social value (which is not measured by the time of labour needed in each
case, but by the time of labour socially required for its production),
thus, the faction of Capital that uses the more performant technique obtains
the same products, and therefore the same value as its competitors with
less work: that's where the extraordinary surplus value comes from.
<p>Capitalists don't bother developing productive forces,... they have
to! The same way, and although they do so to get a higher particular valorization,
willingly or not, (in reality they don't want it!) capitalists provoke
a general devalorization of Capital. This is why long before we did, other
revolutionary militants understood that the contradiction of Capital lies
in Capital itself.
<p>Among the general tendencies necessary to Capital, it is important to
distinguish, on the one hand, the tendency to war of devalorization and
destruction of the historical enemy, and on the other hand, the forms it
takes, that is to say, that the form in which the coercive law of competition
imposes itself appears like a motivation in the consciousness of the different
factions of Capital (trusts, cartels, coalition, National States,...).
<p>That is the reason why, while the whole of bourgeois society is busy
with interbourgeois problems -interimperialist problems-, while before
and during wars the media inform about the relation of forces between the
two opposed camps or talk about governmental and diplomatic chitchat trying
to formalize this relation of forces into this or that kind of agreement
or peace treaty or convention, we stress the fact that imperialist war
is a war of affirmation of capitalism, a war against proletariat, against
communism.
<p>War is as much interimperialist as capitalist and against proletariat.
In the face of this objective reality, both classes have their own interests
and their own class point of view. The bourgeoisie (and the public opinion
it makes) is on the belligerent and interimperialist terrain (terrain from
which come the discourse of the Pope and the other pacifists, and more
generally, the diplomatic agreements); the proletariat, and mainly the
most decided and organized elements of this class, i.e. the communists,
are openly on the terrain of the revolutionary struggle against war.
<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">Our material against war</font></u></h2>
All along the historical struggle against war, the proletarian vanguard
never ceased clarifying all the aspects we have schematized here in a general
and abstract form. Since the Manifesto of the Communist Party claiming
that the proletariat has no country or the Roig de San Martin's order at
the end of last century claiming that "to be a patriot is to be an assassin",
through the explicit claim of revolutionary defeatism in the "first" and
"second" world wars and all the work done later by the communist factions
for the programmatical reappropriation, revolutionary theory of the proletariat
affirmed itself each time more in that sense.
<p>The International Communist Group, as part of the large work done by
our historical Party since its origins up until now, has always centred
its efforts on revolutionary defeatism and has impulsed in this framework
theoretical clarification; we have published historical material of our
class, we have taken position against all wars of Capital and, in so far
as we were able to, our group participated in different actions and meetings
trying to organize the revolutionary minorities leading the proletariat
in its struggle against Capital.
<p>Once again we claim the general coherence of the material we published
in this sense in our central reviews, not only because we think they can
contribute to explain the Gulf war and what they call now (April 1991)
peace in that area, but also because they still are essential for the understanding
of the future.
<p>Beside the Theses of Programmatical Orientation of our group that are
an attempt to put forward the evidence of the relationship between the
contradiction capital-communism and imperialist war-social revolution,
material we have published (without being exhaustive) can be divided into
three groups. They are as follows:
<p>1) fundamental works about capitalism and wars;
<p>2) revolutionary defeatism and organization of the community of struggle
against Capital and war;
<p>3) analyses of military forces and positions against war and for the
revolution.
<h3>

Of course, this classification is arbitrary and more than a text could
be in two or in all sections. On the other hand, even if we consider the
whole of these texts as the fruit of our Party, of the historical Party
of the proletariat, some were not written (or exclusively written) by our
small group.
<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">The framework of our analysis of the Gulf
War</font></u></h2>
The recent war in the Gulf has been an unquestionable demonstration of
the validity of the analysis done by revolutionary Marxism.
<p>Against all bourgeois discourses claiming that, at last, the epoch of
eternal peace has arisen, once again capitalism has showed its truly warlike
nature.
<p>The imperialist war once again confirmed itself as war of Capital for
its conservation, as war against proletariat. That is to say, it proved
itself to be at the same time war for big money and destruction of productive
forces, to be an international window for arms industries and to be the
moment of the massacre of proletarians.
<p>About the immense forces in the Gulf war, the analysis of the military
power of the USA (and more particularly the general reorganization of the
army, done in this country to take over the role of super-gendarme of the
international bourgeois order even better) is important enough to call
the reader to read our text "The army and the military politics of the
United States". In the Gulf war it appeared as a whole what we described
as the reorganization of the army and the military politics of the United
States, it found in this war its rightest confirmation and application.
Since we wrote the text, the only thing that has changed within the most
powerful military force of the world is the growing importance of conflicts
of the so-called "medium-intensity" (such as the Gulf war) in relation
with other so-called conflicts of "high-intensity" (unlikely to happen
-momentarily- with the end of the Warsaw PPact, and determined by the interimperialist
contradictions within the Warsaw Pact itself) and the conflicts of "low-intensity"
(diminution of the relative importance of guerrilla groups); but even this
variation is nothing but an application of the general flexibility that
we analyzed in our texts.
<p>While taking up this subject starting from the area of war, it might
be useful to read some of the articles in which our group, against the
current, insisted on the importance of the development of the contradiction
between "war and revolution" in that region. While no one saw anything
but a war between two countries, in these articles we put forward that
in Iran and Iraq, it was a capitalist war against the proletariat. We insisted
on the fact that it was a war against the revolutionary action of the proletariat
in the area (especially in Iran, where the bourgeoisie played the radical
card of Khomeini to stop the proletarian revolt that had managed to disarm
one of the strongest armies of the world), we said that it was a war to
affirm counterrevolution. All along these texts we have always presented
peace as a moment of war, and for this reason, when Iran and Iraq signed
a peace treaty and everyone thought the question was out, we kept on insisting
and calling revolutionaries to carry on and organize the work of the community
of struggle of the proletariat against war and peace in Iran and in Iraq,
and we made an international meeting with this aim.
<p>We did so as much on the basis of our global conception (peace and war
as expressions of the same totality against the proletariat) as on the
basis of information we had thanks to contacts (confirming that the military
mobilization carried on). It is essential to read the Manifesto written
by our comrades in the area in 1982 (in Le Communiste No.24) as well as
"Iran-Iraq: class war against imperialist war" (in Wildcat No.10), or "Massacre
in Hallabja" (in Communism No.6), because, on the basis of our comrades'
information we put forward that beyond the contradiction between imperialist
forces at war in Iran and Iraq and at different moments of the past, the
principal contradiction between capitalist war (and peace) on the one hand
and proletariat on the other hand reaches impressive levels of exacerbation.
<p>Starting from this framework of analysis for years, our group considers
the Iran-Iraq area as a key area for the development of the contradiction
between bourgeoisie and proletariat, capital and communism. In this sense,
the realization of an international campaign against capitalist war, and
more particularly against war and peace in Iran and in Iraq, has been the
central axis of our internationalist activity (cf. "The invariance of our
international activity: some practical elements to concretize this proposition"
in Communism No.5 and "Massacre in Hallabja" in Communism No.6).
<p>Although at the level of analysis there is nothing to add, seeing the
development of the Gulf war, its quickness, the continuation of internal
interbourgeois wars in the area, it could be interesting and useful to
make a consequent description, starting from our class point of view and
against all media lies.
<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">Open war against the proletariat</font></u></h2>
The first thing we want to underline is, opposite to all that was said,
that the Gulf war was a war against us, a war against proletarians.
<p>Once more in the history of capitalism tens and hundreds of thousands
of proletarians were sent to butchery, to massacre on behalf of the peace
of the homeland, of democracy, of the liberation from imperialism and/or
dictatorship. Once again behind the proletarians killing each other there
lay nothing else but a problem of money, a lot of money, a problem of value
fighting to valorize, of capitalist war, of war of capital.
<p>Everything was set up for the generalized best massacre. In August '90,
the Iraqi State cleared up the prisons. Proletarians considered to be the
most politically dangerous ones were slaughtered. It was a current practice
during the war with Iran. It was interrupted when the two countries signed
a truce. Then the State granted an amnesty to most of the so-called "common
law" prisoners as well as to lots of ex-deserters. It offered them some
money to justify it and sent all of them (most of whom were not prepared
to fight) to the front.
<p>On the battlefield in Iraq and in Kuwait these proletarians (remember
that immigrant proletarians were the first to be recruited by force in
the Iraqi army and sent to the front) were literally buried, obliged by
guns pointed in their back to stay in the trenches dug in the desert. In
front of them there were minefields to prevent desertion and surrender,
in their backs there were the elite troops (the republican guard) assuring
summary execution to anyone who tried to go backwards or to run away.
<p>Once the land offensive had been unleashed, the Coalition Forces crew
over their victory and claimed they had put three quarters of the regular
forces of the enemy out of the fight (although there were only ten percent
of the republican guard amongst the latter). According to our point of
view this clearly is the cynical confession of the fact that the massacre
was concentrated on <u>proletarians</u> wearing uniforms. These cries of
victory confirm that tens of thousands of human beings without any possibility
to defend themselves were sacrificed by the Iraqi State and the Coalition
Forces. For the Iraqi State still shooting at its own troops that were
massively deserting the day before, this deployment of forces was essential:
these tens of thousands of beings transformed into cannon fodder would
hold up (even just a few days) the irremediable advance of the enemy. For
the Coalition, these troops keeping still, buried and without any sophisticated
weapons were a very easy target on which the whole of the killing material
could be checked with very few risks for themselves.
<p>Long before the official launching of the combats, the Iraqi civil population
had been taken as hostages (the other "hostages" -the bourgeois- managed
to be released) and undergone for months a situation of generalized shortage
because of the total blockade (health care and food included) organized
and controlled by the whole of the Coalition countries with the support
of the United Nations. Here as well, the Iraqi State will take over the
blockade subordinating life to the requirements of its war, imposing an
even higher level of militarization on the whole of society and, doing
so, ever more strongly submitting proletarians to the interests of the
nation. By the way, let's notice that it's this situation of food embargo
and blockade that most of the pacifists claim. As good humanists, it is
to this situation they proposed to go back, once the bombing had started,
in order to go right to the end with the blockade.
<p>About bombings themselves, no one tried to hide the hundreds of thousands
of tons of bombs dropped on the Iraqi and Kuwaiti territories, sowing death
and destruction. On the contrary, media make all they could to convince
the whole planet that it was just a "surgical operation" destroying only
military targets. Starting from the same hypocrite distinction between
civilian and soldier (those enrolled by force for instance are "naturally"
considered as military targets), the aim of the propaganda is to make the
proletariat of the rest of the world accept the development of "such a
far away" massacre. We know these are our class brothers who have been
oppressed to the extreme by war, who have undergone this nightmare and
have fallen under tones of death material dropped on them day after day.
<p>Given the political-military weakness of the block led by Saddam Hussein,
the proletariat of the Coalition countries didn't directly suffer from
the bombings or from other atrocities inherent in wars (only the troops
of elite count a few deaths), but nevertheless, it endured a violent attack
against the conditions of the reproduction of its life (and thus its struggle)
materialized as well in <b>an increase of the exploitation rate</b> as
in the generalized increase of repression. In most cases, the increase
of the exploitation rate took the shape of exceptional price rises -without
wage compensation- under the pretext of the rising of oil price (due to
speculative questions and not at all to shortage). It also took the shape
of levying taxes to finance the national effort of war. The generalized
increase of repression was especially directed at any struggle making an
attempt on national unity and at any insubordination to war politics. In
the United States, in Turkey, in North African countries, in Thailand,
military speeches of the governments were accompanied by draconian and
terrorist measures of persecution of the deserters, by the imprisonment
of tens of thousands of proletarians who rejected the criminal imperialist
politics of "their own" bosses, of "their own" National State. Lastly,
during this short period, the State intensified the measures of police
control of the whole of the population in many countries while it did everything
to detect, catch and terrorize anyone who fought against "their own State",
i.e. internationalist militants.
<p>The big swindle was that at the same time the World State was organizing
the most incredible concentration of deaths and terror machines in the
Middle East, and presenting itself elsewhere as the champion of antiterrorism
and, under this pretext, pursuing revolutionary militants!!!
<p>In Turkey, Tunisia, Morocco, Algeria,... war allowed direct repression
to rain on the proletarian struggles. In Turkey, the end of 1990 and the
beginning of 1991 were marked by a lot of very radical and hard strikes
in the mining area (Zanguldak), but also in the metallurgical industry
and the car industry. In Tunisia, while rejecting the gendarmes of the
World State represented by the Coalition, proletarians' massive and regular
demonstrations -expressing the generalized discontent- were violently repressed
as being pro-islamist demonstrations: another attempt to divert and channel
these demonstrations, while giving credit to the Ennhada movement, always
extremely loyal to the government. A similar situation existed in Algeria,
where the government, to prevent another "October '88", mobilized, just
as if it was also participating in the war, troops were stationed and concentrated
in big cities, reservists were recalled, and young soldiers doing military
service were obliged to prolong their presence and fight for the Algerian
colours. On December 14th, 1990, in Morocco, the State crushes a proletarian
revolt (40 deaths).
<p>In France, England, Belgium,... bourgeoisie doesn't waste time and intensifies
its racist and xenophobic politics. In England, for instance, Iraqi refugees
(whose
majority fled from the jails of Saddam Hussein's state terrorism) were
imprisoned into detention camps (real concentration camps) and anyone coming
from the Middle East was suspicious, put on files and prosecuted for being
a potential terrorist. At the same time in Belgium, more than 6,000 Moroccans
were threatened with expulsion.
<p>On the other hand, with war, companies having rentability problems,
saw the volume of their sales falling down and took profit of the situation
to make the proletarians responsible for it. Pan American, Air France and
British Airways, for instance, made thousands of redundancies.
<p>In the United States, the generalized silence of the population towards
the war politics of the government, the consensus so often commented in
the press, didn't prevent this government from violently repressing a lot
of demonstrations against war (although most of these demonstrations were
led by pacifists) or from arresting some 15,000 persons according to Cuban
media. While during the first days of the aerial war one suddenly noticed
for the first time for years an alarming deficit, the State violently repressed
groups diffusing leaflets against war in recruitment centres and to soldiers
sent to war whether they liked it or not. In the United States, an association
of soldiers' defense called "Horreo Counseling Network" denounced the fact
that "many hundreds of North-American soldiers staying in Germany were
forced to embark to the Gulf, bound hand and foot when necessary".
<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">The framework of our analysis of the interimperialist
struggle</font></u></h2>
From our point of view, imperialist antagonisms are of course less important
than the immanent tendencies that push Capital to war against proletariat;
that is the reason why, on these pages, the reader will find few paragraphs
dedicated to the analysis of these antagonisms. It is nothing but an application
of our class position that makes us take the side of the camp fighting
against war; it is a materialization of our invariant line: to focus everything
on what constitutes the central dynamic of this society and its negation.
<p>Nevertheless, as we said before, protagonists don't make war because
they feel like killing proletarians (although there are no doubts that
in many cases they make agreements, on the basis of a military bourgeois
front, to do so; especially when it is a matter of quelling a proletarian
revolt), they make war to confront their competitors. To do this, and seeing
the importance of the capitalist confrontations in the Gulf, we find it
necessary to briefly analyze the imperialist contradictions that determined
this war, without pretending those lines could be a sufficient explanation.
<p>We have already put forward that the development of the Gulf war (or
of other wars to come), as war against the proletariat didn't surprise
us, considering our framework of analysis; we shall see now that there
is nothing to be surprised at as far as the development of interimperialist
contradictions leading to the Gulf war is concerned.
<p>Analysts of international politics (as well as groups claiming to be
revolutionaries) were almost all totally bewildered by the changes of alliances,
by the disappearance of this or that block or unity, and by the affirmation
of the polarization that had led, in the Gulf, to a war between the Coalition
led by yankee imperialism on one side and by Saddam Hussein and his allies
on the other side.
<p>According to our point of view on the contrary, the reconciliation of
the imperialist forces, relegating other contradictions to a position of
secondary importance and making the Gulf war materialize, didn't surprise
us, either.
<p>Indeed, in capitalist society putting yesterday's alliances back into
question is something permanent and particularly when the crisis is aggravating;
the disruption of imperialist shares made in any kind of peace framework
is implicit in the essence of Capital itself and in the kind of unity the
latter realizes. As we say in the "Theses of Programmatical Orientation",
the bourgeoisie is in general opposed to the proletariat, because while,
in the midst of the proletariat, unity is the product of a total community
of interests, bourgeois unity is always unity against others, unity of
opposed interests unified against others who, in these circumstances, look
like the first to confront.
<p><font size=+0>Our thesis number 19 says:</font>
<blockquote><i>"This is how the world character of capitalism gives birth
to the proletariat as <u>world class</u>, without any regional, sector-based
or national interests to defend. Opposed to the proletariat, the bourgeoisie
did not only realize its revolution affirming its particular interests,
but its own essence (competition) forces it permanently to violently tear
one another and confront each other at all levels for the distribution
and re-distribution of the means of production and commodities. Unity among
the bourgeois (limited companies, agreements between monopolies, National
States, constellation of states,... World State) is always realized to
face commercial war and/or class war in the best possible conditions. This
unity may explode at any moment and burst into different particular factions.
That's the reason why the more "unified" and generalized the action of
the bourgeoisie is, the more it contains the division; peace is only a
stage of the war to come. For the proletariat, however, any action, even
the most partial one, contains universality: one single action of our class
against capital, even if it is regional or sector-based, contains the affirmation
of our proper interests in every part of the world and the struggle for
the universal social revolution."</i></blockquote>
The so often commented changes in the East are nothing else but the exacerbation
of the crisis of Capital. Perestroika or any pseudo-alternative of the
economic politics of Capital are nothing else but different names to hide
the old bourgeois politics of austerity and belt-tightening proper to crisis
periods (under the high universal patronage of the International Monetary
Fund!!!). In the same way, the death of the Warsaw Pact and the interbourgeois
struggles in some East European countries, which undoubtedly conditioned
the redistribution of the imperialist forces and allowed not only the Gulf
war but also the present cease-fire, are a confirmation of our analysis.
<p>We can say exactly the same about the changes of alliances amongst the
different forces of the Middle East or amongst the Occidental powers that
invaded the Persian Gulf. Changes of alliances that we comment on Communisme
No.32 and Comunismo No.27, where we described the sudden transformation
of the big ally of the Western States, Saddam Hussein, into a machiavellian
and fascist monster; while the same Western States were flirting and dancing
with the terrorist regimes of Syria and Morocco on behalf of a fight "against
dictatorship". That is to say that the States of England, France, the United
States,... are not the only ones which, on behalf of the struggle against
the violation of the international right (right that they create -considering
their terrorist power- and which is nothing else but the ideological expression
of this relation of force), form the Coalition and this way easily legitimate
any violation on behalf of this right, but also the State of Syria maintaining
its occupation in Lebanon, the Israeli State maintaining occupied territories
for years in open violation of the same right, the State of Turkey assuring
terrorism in Cyprus, the State of Morocco doing what it wants against all
international norms in Western Sahara. All those powers form <b>a Coalition
that cannot present itself with its own legitimacy</b>, a Coalition that
can only appear as any bourgeois unity, that is to say as <b>a circumstantial
and without principles unity against an as much circumstantial enemy</b>.
<p>At the same time, it is beyond doubt that if today this circumstantial
contradiction internationally prevails, it is because the old war contradiction
(NATO-Warsaw) solidified during the other war, or, <b>which is the same</b>,
in the other peace (Yalta agreements) was not so important any more and
could be considered as something of secondary importance (or even less).
Our framework of analysis, always based on the essence of Capital, always
distinguishes itself from superficial analyses that could only consider
war as a war between two stiff blocks, a "capitalist" one and a "socialist"
one, or a "pro-Yankee" and a "pro-Russian" one (1). All those who play
with these journalistic stupidities are disarmed as much in their explanations
of the interimperialist wars that are taking place in the East, as in the
polarization that made the Gulf war possible. Those for whom the world
was effectively cut into two or three (we have always fought against these
ideological prejudices in our central reviews as well as in our Thesis
-see thesis No.27) are today obliged to doo "political" gymnastics about
the changes of nature of the Eastern countries, or about the end of the
Eastern block. On top of all that there are those who could see essential
differences in the social nature of Western and Eastern regimes, considering
them either as "socialist" or as "state capitalist" (2).
<p>According to us, this change of alliance, this modification of intercapitalist
blocks is by no means extraordinary, it is just <b>the inevitable consequence
of the essential determinations of Capital</b> and can be seen all throughout
the history of this mode of production. This is what can explain, for instance,
and against all these ideologies, that the same imperialist power (although
called socialist) may sell weapons to both camps of a local interimperialist
war (just like Czechoslovakia did during the Biafra-Nigeria confrontation);
this is the explanation for the changes of alliances in Ethiopia as well:
there the imperialist penetration insured by the State of Cuba supported
first "the liberation struggle of the people of Eretrea" and later, on
the basis of an agreement with the State of Ethiopia (agreements determined
by the advent of a pro-Moscow government) and on behalf of "the defence
of territorial integrity of Ethiopia", considered yesterday's allies as
its worse enemies and sprayed them with napalm and bullets. There are thousands
of examples of this kind, but to show the invariance of this feature of
capitalism, let us take an example from the past century: after a while,
the capital originated from Europe became autonomous and waged war against
the factions that wanted to maintain the status quo. In every case, capital
breaks from its national origins: the capital originated from England (and
Europe, in general) and solidified as North-American capital, confronted
England in a war for independence, and creole capitalists in South-America
allied with England to wage an imperialist war of independence against
Spain.
<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">Reasons for the launching of the imperialist
military action</font></u></h2>
Of course, our framework of analysis given, we are not very interested
in speculations about how the alliance broke, who allies with whom, which
government changes imperialist camp, which imperialist block allies with
which, which one takes the initiative for war,... It could only be interesting
in relation with the forces of the different alliances to control and channel
the proletariat, or in as much as the justification of alliances and wars,
once transformed into forces by parties, unions, means of (dis)information,...
are ideological forms able to give a framework to the proletariat. It is
from this point of view that in the midst of a generalized war campaign
we put forward the limits these polarizations could contain:
<blockquote><i>"This is not the place to put our oar in the generalized
speculation about future launching of a war. We just want to stress that
the present repolarization of the world and the coming confrontations do
not seem to be mature enough for the constitution of new blocks and new
mystifications to realize the supreme aim of the bourgeoisie: to lead the
worldwide proletariat to war.</i></blockquote>

<blockquote><i>We do not underestimate the adhesion aroused by Saddam Hussein
of important parts of the international proletariat because of their hatred
for the gendarme States of the great powers, but it seems to us that the
"Baghdad Butcher" is far too discredited in the eyes of his own troops
and population (just like Kadhafi and Arafat are) to reach the supreme
aims of Capital. Nevertheless, we do not exclude the development of the
polarization and military conflicts in the short term, but we want to warn
of the danger of an international bourgeois polarization "clearer", more
"attractive" and thus more dangerous for the worldwide proletariat, if
Saddam Hussein's flags are to be taken by factions of Capital less discredited
in the eyes of their own population."</i></blockquote>
That is to say that, as we were claiming the need for Capital to generalize
war (a need which is always more violent seeing the exacerbation of the
crisis and the necessity for devalorization), we were also defining the
limits of the interbourgeois polarization of the "Gulf war" from the point
of view of its capacity to give a framework to the proletariat (no capacity
meaning no generalization of the war). Taking into account the development
of the antagonisms during the latest decade, we considered Saddam Hussein's
camp very weak (the man as well as the party) and we estimated that it
was impossible for him to create an international alternative to the judeo-christian
imperialism, as he claimed to be able to do. All this was confirmed by
the total lack of support to Saddam Hussein's regime, on the internal,
as well as on the international level, and above all, by the total lack
of fighting spirit of "his own troops".
<p>The imperialist initiative of the State of Iraq to invade Kuwait was
not the produce of a force but of a whole of weaknesses. This did not surprise
us, given that generally these bourgeois factions have the biggest problems
to accumulate, as well as to control their own population. They feel compelled
to break the framework of imperialist peace by this or that kind of armed
action, which unveils them as aggressor and therefore gives the advantage
to their adversary in the military confrontation (since the old Clausewitz
systematized it in his book "On war", everyone knows that defence is strategically
superior to offence). This can be checked all throughout this century's
big European wars called first and second world wars. The most disadvantaged
imperialist powers in the prior peaces, the ones which were therefore less
favoured by the share of the productive forces and pre-existent markets,
were those that took over the initiative of the first invasions, which
led them to grant a strategic advantage that proved fatal for them.
<p>The same applies to the Iraqi State: its situation in the interimperialist
competition was a disaster and worsened by the deterioration of exchange
materialized in a commercial balance-sheet getting more and more unfavourable,
as well as in a huge external debt ($70 to 90 billion in August 1990).
In this sense, the breaking off the agreements on the OPEC prices by part
of the States the most submitted to the imperialist politics of the Western
powers, as Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, was seen by the Iraqi bourgeoisie as
an aggression on the whole of their accumulation cycle. Invading and annexing
Kuwait (and seeing the new conditions imposed on Saudi Arabia), the Iraqi
State wanted to change this situation and not only did it want to reappropriate
new productive forces (raw material, fuel, and an exit to the sea), but
also to increase the percentage of petrol production controlled by the
Kuwaiti bourgeoisie, to improve the relation of forces in the OPEC, as
well as the relation of forces (idem) of the latter in the world, and revalorize
this way its first source of foreign currency. Simultaneously, the Iraqi
State wanted to find new reasons to justify the permanent militarization
in the eyes of the proletariat and to solidify a new opposition "against
imperialism". It was looking for a national adhesion that it never achieved
although it had crushed by military force the big wave of revolutionary
defeatism that had swept through the country a short time before (cf. our
texts about the Iran/Iraq war).
<p>It is clear, that from the point of view of world Capital, this invasion
questioned it in a way which was too generalized to be acceptable. Loosing
the control of such an important part of the means of production meant
that a huge percentage of petrol passed under the control of other factions,
it also was a great attack against the accumulation cycle of an important
part of the world bourgeoisie. Add this to the geo-political interests
of the great powers of Capital (any negotiation between the opposing forces
-cf. the denial of the negotiations betweeen Saddam Hussein and the military
power of the United States through their embassy in Kuwait, negotiations
in which the United States committed themselves not to use their military
force) and it will easily be understandable that the invasion of Kuwait
by the Iraqi State was to be considered as an aggression on the other imperialist
powers' interests.
<p>From the point of view of the United States these facts formed a whole
of circumstances perfect to confront the great difficulties of the Capital
management of that productive area and to strengthen its military power.
In relation to this, we want to stress the following points:
<ul>
<li>
In the face of the generalized crisis of accumulation in the productive
area of the USA that could be seen for months and about which the economists
were talking as "vertical fall", war appeared as the old Keynesian solution
to increase public expenditure (without a high increase in the deficit
in this case, given that it was financed by other forces), to increase
effective demand and thus reactivate national economy (and seeing the importance
of the latter, the world economy).</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
Geo-politically, war was the dreamed situation to affirm the United States'
role as a big international gendarme. On the one hand, they presented themselves
more than ever as the ones keeping the flag of international right flying,
and on the other hand they conquered in practice a strategic situation
of unquestionable geo-military value.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
In the same way, the national and international militarist mobilization
under the US flag against a much weaker enemy strategically strengthened
the role of that State in the face of all its possible adversaries and
solidified at the same time the army by providing it with new real motives
to make war (against dictators, terrorists, invaders,...). This point is
very important considering the general deterioration of the image of gendarme
given inside as well as outside the country by the war of Vietnam and other
later wars.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
It was the ideal situation to try to impose a kind of Capital order (against
others) on one of the most coveted areas in the world, an area that has
been a receptacle of contradictions for decades. Indeed, the consolidation
and the general recognition of the State of Israel with Jerusalem as internationally
recognized capital (in return for this or that kind of minor concessions
so that, as the world bourgeoisie says, "the Palestinians have their State")
are only possible under the general and military protection of this imperialist
colossus, the State of the USA.</li>
</ul>
This short enumeration is not exhaustive and we are not interested in going
into deeper details. But it is clear that in the decision made on launching
this imperialist war itself we have to take into account the more particular
interests of a whole of bourgeois factions directly involved, such as those
so politically proud of "restoring the American honour", such as the military
"lobby" including key-men of the Pentagon and directors of big arms industries
(that is to say big industries as such!!), the Jewish "lobby", etc.
<p>We are not interested either in analyzing the other international factions
of Capital and their alignment with the United States. About the more general
reasons for the war let us say that it is evident that if the invasion
of Kuwait had been transformed into an occupation, it would have seriously
affected the cycle of international Capital because a new balance of power
on the petrol price would have led to a redistribution of the surplus value
internationally extracted in favour of the bourgeois controlling the raw
material, probably against the ones distilling it and surely against the
ones industrially depending on it. The fact that the UNO appeared much
more a real agency of the USA than the usual web of intrigue where interimperialist
antagonisms are diplomatically expressed, is due to this general fear that
pushed all the factions to coincide about the restoring of the imperialist
order prior to August 2nd. In the same way, it is clear that the old alliances
that this occasion strengthened (NATO), weighed as much as the without-principles-unity
against a common enemy (cf. the fact that the States of Israel and Syria
can be found in the same military block, for instance).
<p>In the medium and the long term, a petrol power as big as the USSR would
have benefited from the occupation and it did not have any reason to align
against Saddam Hussein. If, in the beginning, the Russian State legitimated
the Coalition imperialist force, it was:
<ul>
<li>
because of the objective weakness of its own imperialist power. Given its
internal contradictions, this weakness, it could not present itself as
a unified force.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
because the governing faction seems to represent each day more clearly
the most dynamic interests of world Capital. Opposing to the protectionist
interests of the local productive area, when necessary. Nevertheless, as
this legitimation of the Coalition against Iraq could be verified as an
objective transfer of imperialist rights against its traditional rival
that was solidifying itself as total gendarme for the first time (tendency
to change from a shared international hegemony to a near-monopoly), the
violence of criticisms of the militarist factions (linked to the army leadership,
the internal security and the navy) and the military-industrial establishment
redoubled. Even the press echoed it. It was said that the situation in
the Gulf put the security of the USSR in danger and the Soviet armed forces
journal even wrote that the direction of foreign policy was "the less intelligent
ever developed by a Minister of Foreign Affairs, tsarists and Soviets included".
This compelled the government to try -unsuccessfully- to boost a little
the image of the State as being one of the great protagonists of the imperialist
decision made on sharing the world. This is the explanation for the tragi-comical
show played by the government of the USSR unceasingly proposing peace treaties
and cease-fires. But none of these attempts could reach their goal because
there was no military force decided enough to impose a cease-fire agreeing
with its contradictory interests.</li>

<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">The big business of war</font></u></h2>
Finally, we would like to stress - as one of the reasons for the launching
of any kind of interimperialist action - the importance of the interest
of big business that gets large profits out of the war, i.e. the interests
of different types of bourgeois factions from different countries, who
benefit from the war and from the reconstruction that will follow.
<p>Capitalist war is not only profitable to Capital in general for the
different reasons we have mentioned, it is not only profitable to the bourgeois
faction that becomes victorious in the interimperialist contradiction,
but it also brings about profit for a whole set of particular capitals
which make important commercial deals during and after wartime.
<p>Of course, one thinks straight away about the bourgeois factions which
are directly linked to the military, such as capital that is involved in
arms' production and military sectors as such, all these, without exception,
benefit from the increasing of the military budget; but there are also
other factions that directly benefit from the war this way. For instance,
all the big car factories produce also different kinds of war-vehicles
(to transport troops, armoured cars, etc.). To produce these products other
kinds of raw material are required, the producers of which also directly
benefit from war. To stick to the example of the car industry, we can see
that the producers of metal, plastic, rubber, computers,... also get involved,
as well as banking services, accountancy services, etc.. For each of these
numerous sectors, tens if not hundreds of big and smaller factories will
get involved in this lucrative market and will compete with each other
in order to increase their parts and benefits of the war market.
<p>And of course, the Gulf war also mobilised and militarized hundreds
of thousands of men and kept them far away from their sources of supply.
All this shows clearly how big the problems of logistics were. And this,
of course, has attracted a lot of different sectors of capital, which also
increased their turnover spectacularly, e.g. the sectors involved in tinned
food, water supplies, etc..
<p>This is why the news of the outbreak of the war was cheerfully welcomed
by the different bourgeois factions. We don't know if this is true, but
certain newspapers reported that in Houston, Texas, for instance, -an important
center of the oil refinery- the day after August 2nd, not a single bottle
of champagne could be found in the supermarkets, since the bourgeois of
that town had already celebrated the war that would reactivate- so they
figured -their enterprises. What we are sure about, however, is that a
few months later, the stock-exchanges of the whole world welcomed the beginning
of the war with euphoria! As Thomas McCarrol wrote in an article of El
Pais (January 27th):
<blockquote><i>"The day after the launching of the air-raids on Iraq, the
people present at the New York Stock Exchange started the day with a minute
of silence to honor the North-American troops fighting in the Gulf. But
this moment of meditation was the only break of the whole day. The opening
was soon to be followed by a wave of outcries: BUY! BUY! BUY! When all
this agitation calmed down, the Stock Exchange had lived one of its most
active days! The Dow Jones climbed 114 points, the second most important
rise of its whole history... The Stock Exchanges of the whole world shared
the same euphoria... In Germany the Frankfurt Stock Exchange marked the
highest daily rise of its history and rose by 1.6% while the Japanese Nikke&iuml;
in Tokyo rose by 2.4%."</i></blockquote>
No need to be an expert in bourgeois balance-sheets to understand the meaning
of these historical records related to the outbreak of the war. No need
either to be an economist to see that the notorious CNN, as well as the
other television networks, during all these days of war and massacres of
our class, showed a real "weapon fair", an incredible industrial and electronical
market, which for the first time in history and on such a massive scale
displayed numerous arms, machines, missiles, means of transportation, high-tech
equipment, etc. All this meant billions of dollars of increase in the sales
of North American industry; and this is also the reason why the economic
results during the first days of the war, were extraordinary! (3) This
is what Julian Martinez writes in El Pais, on January 27th, 1991:
<blockquote><i>"The results of the first days of the war could not have
been more optimistic for all sectors related to the defence. In Wall Street,
nearly all values related to military industry have risen. For instance,
during the first few days of the war, some of them gained 37%, like General
Dynamics, which produces the powerful Tomahawk missiles, the F-111 fighterplanes
as well as the M1 tanks. General Dynamics's rival, Mc Donald Douglas, increased
its profit by about 25%, thanks to the TV news which showed fighter planes
F-15, F-18, Apache helicopter and also Tomahawk missiles. Enterprises that
produce bombs, orientation equipment, and electronic systems for air navigation
increased the value of their shares. It is expected that when the army
and the Marines get into action, the companies producing new arms will
also benefit from the boom in the Stock Exchange</i> [one can easily notice
here how each sector of Capital has its own particular interests, even
in this particular kind of war -our comment]. <i>The constructor of "the
star" of the war, the famous Patriot Missile, is particularly satisfied
with the enormous publicity its product received all over the world. The
factories and the enterprises which produce components of this missile
-Raytheon and Martin Marietta- increased tthe value of their shares in Wall
Street."</i></blockquote>
No need to be a scholar to know that if these marvellous expectations did
not come true, it is because the situation of the world economy is disastrous
and because the Gulf war was not important enough to reverse the process
of economic crisis. The level of war and destruction that Capital needs
to regenerate itself and to eradicate -on this basis- its existing depression,
is much bigger!
<p>As far as the big business of the after-war period is concerned, it
is worth mentioning that in the middle of the war, while they were still
busy heaping up thousands of corpses and destroying not only military targets
(as they pretended), but also the complete industrial infrastructure, as
well as the communications and sanitary networks, the large international
trusts were already competing with each other over the distribution of
the tremendous contracts for the reconstruction of the war zones -just
like gigantic vultures fighting over carcasses and litter! The amount of
the multinational contracts that were signed for the reconstruction of
the industrial infrastructure of Kuwait, was estimated at about one hundred
billion dollars, and the financial arrangements for the reconstruction
of Iraq were estimated to amount to more than two hundred billion dollars!
<p>The capitalist vultures did not wait a second to share the carcasses.
They did not even wait for the ex-allies to transform themselves into enemies.
When finally the hour arrived to share the profitable dividents from the
biggest of all capitalist trades -war and reconstruction- they all rushed,
without any hesitation, onto their preys.
<p>In "Le Monde Diplomatique" of March 1991, J.D. writes:
<blockquote><i>"More and more plans are being elaborated for the reconstruction
of Kuwait and for the reinforcement of the Saudi power. At the heart of
the industrial-military complex, stands the Bechtel firm, which already
has important political and financial experience in the region. The same
is true for Motorola, Mc Donald Douglas, General Dynamics, ATT. Forty-five
billion dollars could possibly be "picked up" in Kuwait only. In Saudi
Arabia, the promises are just as juicy, because Ryad says it will reinforce
its airforce and buy a few hundred more tanks. Even though nobody is talking
about the reconstruction of Iraq, everybody is thinking about it. Only
the stubborn liberals disapprove that these contracts do not respect the
Right - the right of competition. And in all these cases, Washington imposed
its views: Saudi Arabia is not to be entrusted to some French firms as
this has been suggested in the beginning, but to E-Systems from Dallas.
The modernization of the phones? The French and the Swedish were on the
lists, but when the American Secretary for Trade and, later on, Mr. Bush
himself intervened, now ATT and Motorola have better chances. As it seems,
the British Prime Minister would have expressed his dissatisfaction! Such
a loyal ally...</i></blockquote>

<blockquote><i>But after all -if one neglects the number of those who were
killed- perhaps this war will turn out to have been only an even operation
for the USA. Besides the fact that this war is being paid for by a large
number of countries, the US will also benefit from the large amounts of
private dividends that will wipe out the public expenditures. Thanks heaven,
the defence of international law is safe,... if not, one would easily get
inspired about some simple truth, and this is total sacrilege in these
days of international sacred union."</i></blockquote>
This means that the international sacred union had only some validity against
Saddam, and, as "Le Monde Diplomatique" seems to regret it, today again
the law of the jungle is surpassing all other considerations between capitalists.
Those who are the most powerful in the military field, those who invested
most in this big war business are the ones who will get the better dividends
from this war.
<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">The media as instruments of power and war</font></u></h2>
In this chapter we will pay special attention to the role played by the
media. We do not think that during this war they played a role which is
at all different from their ordinary one when they assume a central function
in order to mobilize proletarians for the sake of Capital. No!, if in this
chapter we are especially dealing with this aspect, it is only because
today they are assuming in society as a whole, and they assumed during
the Gulf war in particular, -compared to other State apparatus- a more
important role than in the past.
<p>As a matter of fact, the type of the process of citizenization, (we
published an article on this process (4) which is dominating the proletariat
today, coincides with a phase of massive desertion by proletarians of the
old bourgeois apparatus, such as parties and unions, which serve the purpose
of framing up all proletarian revolt. The influence such bourgeois organisations
may have had is slowly but surely eroding. This process also implies that
life is becoming more separated, compartmentalized, more individual, more
family-like, more locked up inside each house or apartment... This means
that the media -and especially television- become essential means of communication,
and transform themselves in decisive means -directly related to their own
armed forces- for the framing up, the mobilization and the militarization
of the proletariat.
<p>Before, the main intermediary between the worker and his mobilization
for the State, his war-like militarization, was the party (the "workers'"
party, preferably), the union, the "workers' movement"(5). The press and
radio were only supports to increase the efficiency of these organizations.
But the more individualism is developing, the more television as well as
all other means for the production of ideas are transforming themselves
to become central intermediaries for the mobilization of proletarians for
the fatherland, for sending them to the army and to the butchery! We must
not forget that -because of the citizenization process and the generalized
isolation- that for many proletarians who do not have any fellow-workers
to talk to and to discuss with, the television (but the radio and the newspapers,
as well) seems to become the unique (fictitious) ("human") relationship
with the outside world.
<p>On the whole, the campaigns orchestrated by the different means of communication
try to hide the real and fundamental causes of what is going on, and they
make this or that individual be guilty for all what is wrong; therefore,
in view of the needs of the foreign policy of their own State, these campaigns
depict the actions of the enemy as being barbarous, criminal, dictatorial,
terrorist,... and at the same time, they justify the criminal actions of
their own imperialist camp as humanitarian actions, as a struggle against
dictatorship and for democracy...
<p>During the Gulf war, even more so than during previous wars (Vietnam,
Falklands, Grenada, Panama, Afghanistan) the Heads of States and the Commanders
in Chief of the Allied Armed Forces were particularly attentive to the
means of communication: this time they were transformed into real instruments
for brainwashing, for militarization and national mobilization.
<p>During the North-American invasion of Grenada and Panama, the Pentagon
had already requested and obtained from the press that they would use the
word "intervention" rather than "invasion", but during this war, the journalists
went a lot further still when they started talking about "our boys" or
"us" when talking about the troops of the U.S. coalition. In the same manner,
several generals from the Pentagon succeeded each other daily on the television
screens of different international networks, which became nothing less
than the true spokesmen of the Pentagon (the real public relations offices
of the imperialist command). So the journalists started adopting progressively
the language of the generals and that's how the bombings became "surgeon
attacks" and the civilians killed became "collateral" losses, while the
areas that had not yet been bombed, became "lucrative" objectives. In the
face of an American POW that had been beaten up, they talked about "war
crime" (!!!), but at the same time the terrifying bombings that were killing
the population in Baghdad were being presented as "incursions" by "our
freedom fighters".
<p>Nothing was left uncontrolled! Each word, each image was checked, analysed,
censured... and even sometimes, when there was no image to go with the
message that the military and political command had decided to broadcast,
they did not hesitate to produce such a suitable image -out of nothing-
in their laboratories.
<p>The big bosses of the broadcasting firms, the speakers, the journalists
and all the other shitbags accomplished faithfully and wholeheartedly the
adaptation and presentation of reality according to the wishes and needs
of the military command. The lack of independence, the hypocrisy, the submission
and the cynicism of all these press people have already often been denounced...
but we think that it would be more proper to speak about the complete and
total militarization of this particular instrument of domination, about
its achieved integration, by the imperialist State, into the full military
action. And as a matter of fact, each time journalists accomplish more
perfectly their true role as intermediaries of the military action, as
the obeying officers of their superiors, as the indispensable conveyor
belt that aims at turning each proletarian into a patriot, a soldier, an
assassin!
<p>In the face of such an always growing symbiose between the army and
the television networks, between the generals of the armed forces and the
professionals of the spectacle, between the military command and the journalists,
we should ask ourselves whether the revolutionary and insurgent proletariat
should treat these agents of the means of communication in the same way
as it has always treated the officers of the armies, who send the proletarians
to the butchery, i.e. by turning their arms against them!? We will get
the response from the future history of the war and of the struggle against
war, but it is clear that as far as we are concerned, this answer lies
already in today's war.
<p>We could multiply here the always more impressive examples of what those
craftsmen of the spectacle have achieved to "model" the information according
to the needs of the fatherland and of war. We will not go into any more
details about the lies that they believed themselves, e.g. when the bosses
of the Pentagon declared that about 90% of the military potential of the
Iraqi army had been annihilated (after "only" 24 hours of bombings), a
piece of information that the media quickly broadcast over the whole planet!
We will not go into any details about the praise from all the press people
for the "heroism and sacrifices" consented by the pilots of the Coalition
(indeed, how courageous it must have been to drop bombs with an absolute
power of destruction, from a height of 10,000 meters!). And it is not worthwhile
either to insist on the sheer hypocrisy and the total partiality that completely
dominated the propaganda on the use of chemical weapons by Baghdad (in
reality, Baghdad has only used such weapons against its own troops and
population) while nothing was ever said about the use of napalm and fuel
bombs by the Allied forces. Nor will we insist on the total partiality
with which the "daily horror that Israeli citizens had to go through" was
described (mentioning only the Jews; the horror for the Palestinians surely
was not the same -as a matter of fact, a government decree stated that
there were not any gas masks available for them!- while the horror that
came pouring down on the population of Iraq was systematically omitted!
<p>No, all this is only normal for these shock troops of the Western Christian
army. We would rather like to denounce here some elements in this manipulation
of the news. We already knew that they created images, and that a large
number of them -shown on television- were created in computer laboratories.
This was the case for instance for those images that showed missiles hitting
their military target exactly in the middle: in fact, these images had
been shot several years ago in the United States. But undoubtedly, this
is when the modern Goebbels of the little screen excelled: when they tried
to accuse their opponent of not only wasting oil, but also of exterminating
nature and the environment (6). This is when they built up the pitiful
story about a bird covered with black liquid, the bird that they had found
dying in the sea. This story, and these images showing that dying bird,
representing the destruction of nature -something only "bad" people could
possibly desire and provoke on purpose- were circulated around the world.
And probably public opinion has been more influenced and upset about this
dying bird... than it has ever been about any other victim being shown
on TV (and of course, they do not talk about these real deaths). This shows
how extreme the manipulation can be, this gigantic collective idiocy produced
by Capital. Everything seemed to work out just fine... until a specialist
turned up to explain that this kind of bird does not live in the Persian
Gulf area, but lives on the European coasts... and that's how it became
obvious that this story as well was nothing else but a pure strategic laboratory
invention, launched with some political-military goal.
<p>But we do want to mention - as a significant example of this war -the
sudden general discovery of the massacres committed by the regime of Saddam
Hussein, massacres that we have denounced for years, against the stream,
in spite of the fact that our contradictors accused us of "exaggeration"
or even "invention". For several years we have denounced the tens of thousands
of deaths that (during the war and after the signing of the cease-fire
between Iraq and Iran) were caused by the bombings that the Iraqi State
carried out against its own population, while we also denounced the systematic
destruction of tens of cities and small villages. Speaking about the tens
of thousands of deaths, about the hundreds of cities destroyed, has been
considered to be an enormous exaggeration on our part, including at the
time when we called for an international meeting that we had organized
against the war and the peace in this region. As a matter of fact, nobody
talked about all this, while all of a sudden, during the war, the Western
bourgeois press "discovered" the massacres that it had been hiding for
years! It was the "Figaro" newspaper (accusing its allies of yesterday
and excusing those of today) that wrote (8th of March, 1991):
<blockquote><i>"Neither in Iran [sic!], nor in Syria [sic!] or in Turkey
[sic!] did the Kurds experience such a brutality in repression. This brutality
reached a peak at the end of the Iran-Iraq war, in 1988. In March of that
year, while Saddam was winning every battle against the Khomeini troops
and was forcing them to accept a cease-fire, he finally finds himself free
enough to clean up Kurdistan. 'The Kurdish rebels are like ants, we will
crush them,' warns an Iraqi general. And just like on ants, Saddam will
use chemicals on the Kurds. More than 5,000 will get killed in the city
of Halabja alone, the city will be completely destroyed and will be rebuilt
30 kilometers further away; altogether 4,000 cities and villages will be
wiped out, erased from the map, and their population will be transferred
to other areas that are easier to check for the Iraqi army. The poor and
miserable families are packed in sordid townships with large alleys where
armed vehicles can take up position at any moment. In the middle of the
desert, the Iraqi State has installed real concentration camps, disguised
as military basis, to imprison the most rebellious amongst the population.
According to Sami Abdulrahman, the General Secretary of the People's Party
of Kurdistan, 50,000 Kurds have disappeared in this sand-goulag."</i></blockquote>
This is only one example among many others. In reality, the whole of the
main information agencies of the Christian Western world, mobilized for
this new crusade, all of a sudden discovered what they had decided to ignore
for years, and at the same time the heads of the Kurdish nationalist opposition
parties were for the first time well received in the Western imperial centers
of power, and indeed, in the Pentagon itself. Their declarations were widely
echoed by television and by the other different means of production of
the reality of public opinion.
<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">On the balance of forces between the different
blocs and on the short duration of the war</font></u></h2>
The deployment of military troops by both sides does not leave any doubt
about the fact that a longer lasting military confrontation was expected.
On the other hand, the analysis by military experts all concluded about
the same perspective of a longer lasting war and -as far as the Western
Coalition was concerned- a more murderous one! The tens of thousands of
plastic bags that the American authorities had delivered in the area to
"go back home" (as it was worded in certain songs by American soldiers)
do not allow for the slightest doubt about this.
<p>If the war - in its phase of more general confrontation between the
Coalition armies and the troops of the Iraqi State - has met a definite
limit (while we're writing this text, the war between different bourgeois
factions inside Iraq is still going on), this is surely due to the complete
lack of support that the imperialist policy of Saddam Hussein has encountered
and to the ensuing weakness of his imperialist bloc and this has allowed
its enemy to reach its objectives with much less damage than was initially
estimated.
<p>We already announced the weakness of the imperialist bloc directed by
the Iraqi State, precisely because Saddam Hussein has been completely discredited
in the face of his own troops and population (cf. the editorial of "Communisme"
-French central review- No.32). Today we ccan affirm clearly that this constituted
the main obstacle -and indeed the real break- for the continuation of the
war.
<p>We do not think it is necessary to go into any other explanations about
the decisive importance of the adhesion of the proletariat to the imperialist
war... since without such adhesion there simply cannot be any war like
that, as all the burden of bourgeois war, from the battle ground unto the
production lines, lies on the shoulders of the proletarians.
<p>In Iraq, nearly ten years of war and of struggle against war did not
take place in vain. Those hundreds of thousands of workers in uniform were
no longer ready to sacrifice themselves for the national cause of the war.
From the very beginning of the war, the only non-official information that
we received from Iran and Iraq stated that those who had been forcefully
sent on the battlefronts, tried to escape from there and that there had
been many desertions and executions. Comrades from that region also confirmed
- a long time before official sources fromm both sides could no longer hide
the fact that the Iraqi troops were not ready to fight any more, and before
the mass surrenders were shown on television- that the butchery was looking
more and more like a war of extermination and that the common Iraqi soldier
was trapped between two enemy fires: the fire of the Coalition and the
fire of the Republican Guards.
<p>To put it clearly, from the point of view of the Iraqi State, everything
had been going wrong from the very beginning: there had been no decisive
international support on the military and political level (the small support
the Iraqi State did receive -like from the PLO e.g. - did not have any
real significance); it failed in its attempt to make Israel get directly
involved in the war and to build up this way a general front against it;
there was very little credibility of Saddam's so-called anti-imperialism
with the international masses, and this resulted in the complete lack of
positive response to Saddam's different calls, including the lack of response
concerning his call for terrorist attacks,... Even the Republican Guards
did not show any full disposition for fighting and here also desertions
were more massive than initially expected.
<p>In view of the composition of the Coalition forces - composed of all
the bigger international watchdogs of imperialism (USA, France, England,...
and also with the complicity of the Soviet Union) and also in view of the
intrinsic secular hate that the world proletariat feels for them (in general,
it is these powers which always intervene to put down proletarian revolts
and which always support the local bourgeois when the national State can
no longer cope with an insurrectionary situation!), Saddam Hussein hoped
to be able to raise the banner of the struggle against imperialism, as
some others had already done -with more success though- before him. Saddam
Hussein is not Nasser, nor Peron or even less so Che Guevara; Saddam is
nothing else but an already ancient agent in that region, having the same
interests as those who he is pretending to fight today. He is the agent
of France, of the Soviet Union,... and above all, he is a tyrant having
lost all credibility in the face of his own population that he has bombed
without mercy; he is a tyrant incapable of achieving national unity which
is the indispensable condition for the realization of an international
front capable of forcing the big powers to negotiate.
<p>Of course, there have been some demos in several countries, like in
North-Africa or in Europe, in the Far East or in Latin America, where the
crowds -amongst other claims- shouted some slogans in favour of Saddam,
but without any real conviction and more as a provocation in the face of
their own State (like in Spain, e.g.) when it was being considered to be
too submitted to the Western Christian bloc. In quite a few cases also,
the slogans in support of the Iraqi State, were nothing else but the result
of the manoeuvres and manipulations by the local national State so as to
take away all credit from the struggle against the war by assimilating
this struggle against the bourgeoisie and its State as a struggle in support
of the external enemy.
<p>Even the bourgeois organizations of the radical left of the Western
countries, always eager to sell their anti-imperialist speeches - and indeed,
Saddam and Arafat hoped these would take their side - had only little autonomy
in the face of their own national State (probably this is due to the general
down graded situation of these organizations) and they all just claimed
some vague pacifist rethorics: indeed, it was difficult to distinguish
between the speeches held by a Stalinist, by a Castroist or by a Trotskist
and the speeches held by the pope!
<p>There were some "remarkable" exceptions to the cause of international
Trotskism: for the Argentinian MAS e.g. it was no problem to take up the
imperialist side of the butcher of Baghdad. The leaflets of this group,
defending one imperialist camp against another, while hiding systematically
all references to the murderous past (and present) of the Baghdad regime,
for sure are part of the anthology of this war. We will just quote a small
part of one of the leaflets of this group:
<blockquote><i>"When the war breaks out, there will be two clearly defined
opposite military camps. One will be the aggressor camp, under the lead
of the yankees and the support of Gorbatchev, as well as a long list of
lackey governments. Through war, these will pursue, on a higher level still,
the aggression that they triggered 5 months ago, through their military
blockade and their economic genocide. The other side will be the side of
Iraq. On this side we will find the Palestinians of the Intifada, millions
of inhabitants from the Arab and Islam countries, as well as thousands
of militants amongst the workers and the people who everywhere in the world,
oppose the aggression. The Movement for Socialism (MAS) calls on all workers
and on the people of Argentina, to support the Iraqi side. We are in the
same boat as during the Falklands' war</i> (THIS IS CLEAR! It is the same
boat that they share with the Argentinian head of State terrorists who
are guilty of killing and torturing, and of the disappearance of tens of
thousands of our comrades - our comment!) <i>when received the support
of the majority of the people of Latin America and of large parts of the
people of the Middle East, including the Iraqi people."</i></blockquote>

<blockquote>(quotation from a leaflet "Yesterday the Falklands, today Iraq;
Yankees, out of the Gulf" calling for a "day against the imperialist aggression".)</blockquote>

<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">The military superiority of the coalition
forces - against the myth of technology</font></u></h2>
Let's get back to the essential, to the real limits of the war, since there
existed an undeniable superiority of the Coalition forces. From all sides
they tried to make us believe that the impressive triumph of the Coalition
forces is due to their technological development, to the astonishing efficiency
of their military equipment, etc.
<p>The bourgeoisie tries to make us believe that nothing depends on us,
that everything depends on technology, that the latter is opposed to us
(even though it is our own product) as an alien power that is oppressing
and controlling us. The interest of the bourgeoisie is obvious. With such
propaganda, they are telling us: "I'm almighty", "you can do nothing",
"In the face of the State, you don't stand a chance".
<p>But when thinking about this, one soon realizes that all this is nothing
but a big lie. During the Vietnam war, the North-American State had a complete
technological superiority, but was unable to win the war. The same happened
to the Russian army in Afghanistan. Even more so, the same technology that
supposedly destroyed one of the best equipped armies of the world, cannot
manage to defeat a few hundred of guerilleros in other parts of the world,
like in Peru, for instance.
<p>Every military strategist, from Clausewitz until today, knows that the
keyfactor in all wars, is the human factor, the adhesion of the part of
the population to the military policy, and it is this factor that determines
the moral of the troops, the efficiency of the production front, the logistic
capacities, etc. And it is sure, from this point of view, that there was
-as we just wrote- an enormous difference  between the two sides. On one
side, a well disciplined army, ready to go to war, and on the other side,
hundreds of thousands of men, forced to go to war at gunpoint and here
every soldier was a potential deserter. On one side, a very mobile army
with a nearly unlimited capacity to deploy itself, the soldiers of which
-at least a large majority of them- are frree citizens who signed a contract
to sell their capacity to kill ("workforce") (7); on the other side, a
kind of formation and deployment on the battleground where the officers
and the pretorian troops have to maintain a permanent pressure on their
subordinates in order to prevent massive desertions.
<p>All this determined a type of war with positions that favoured even
more the Coalition. Indeed, the type of army and armement that was being
used by the Coalition proved to be very appropriate to attack and destroy
the fixed positions of the enemy. The situation is completely different
when an army of this kind must transform itself into an army of occupation
and for maintaining law and order, and when it is confronting a kind of
popular war, facing autonomous military units. In such situations, the
strategic advantage that derives from the support for the war effort by
large parts of the population, disappears as time goes by. This is exactly
what is happening today to the Israeli State for instance, since it is
caught up relatively powerless in a war of occupation without any perspectives
for a positive evolution - quite to the contrary of what happened during
its blitz-victories in the past. If the North-American command of the Coalition
forces interrupted its military actions before destroying the whole of
the Iraqi military potentials, it is because they know that after all Saddam
Hussein is a good guardian of bourgeois order. Even though it would have
been relatively easy for the Marines to go further as far as Baghdad, it
would have been much more difficult for them to pacify the population in
this region, in the face of an Intifada a hundred times more powerful.
<p>The technological superiority of one of the imperialist sides, and the
never ending bombings that lasted for days and days without any possibility
for the adversary to do anything about it, functioned exactly on the basis
of these two fundamental conditions: the lack of eagerness to fight and
the kind of war of positions that this determined (and also the acceptance
of the classical bourgeois diplomacy by Saddam Hussein and the consecutive
liberation of all the important persons belonging to the enemy camp by
Saddam Hussein -because without this for sure the bombings would have encountered
less national and international support). After weeks of bombings that
accentuated even more the generalized weaknesses of Saddam's troops, the
initial difference in the moral of troops between both sides became even
bigger, and Saddam's imperialist army decomposed without having fought
one single important battle (in spite of the press' exaggerations about
the "Khafji battle") (8).
<p>On the other hand, these intensive bombings disintegrated the whole
regional system of political control of the Iraqi State! The orders from
Baghdad did not get through any more to the troops, nor did they reach
the remote villages of the southern provinces; it took days and days for
news from different geographical points to reach Baghdad, and this -in
such a situation of lack of national unity- was fatal to the Iraqi military
command.
<p>So tens of thousands of new deserters united with the numerous deserters
from the Iran-Iraq war, as well as with those who had never submitted themselves
and those who had organized themselves from the very beginning of the war
and who were just waiting for the right moment to desert or surrender.
Desertion became even more massive as officers themselves deserted and
as the lack of food became more and more widespread. That's how the Coalition
got a much easier victory than expected: besides, it did not really know
what to do with such a victory, because it was no longer possible to hide
that the cohesion of the enemy had been exaggerated for the sake of propaganda,
and also because it had not prepared to round up such a high number of
prisoners. The Coalition military Command was very embarrassed having to
take care of more than a hundred thousand men... so embarrassed that on
several occasions the American officers ordered to shoot on the Iraqi soldiers
who came running towards them - in spite of the white flag they were waving
as a sign of surrender. For sure the Allied Command would have preferred
desertions to be less massive on the Iraqi side, and the imperialist war
to last a bit longer - so as to account more easily (as well as in the
face of the ordinary American citizen, as of the parliamentarians of the
bourgeoisie) for the 500,000 men they sent to the Gulf together with all
other military and logistical efforts.
<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">The struggle of the proletariat against the
war</font></u></h2>
Historically, the proletariat has proved its enormous creativity in the
struggle against war: the sabotage of military trains, the execution of
officers, internationalist propaganda, revolutionary defeatism, massive
organization of deserters, the constitution of unitary workers' and soldiers'
associations, strikes, demos,... In the face of the highest level of barbarity
of capitalist domination, everything is valuable and every action against
"the holy union" transforms itself into an action of internationalist solidarity
against the war.
<p>We could draw up a list of the proletarian actions against the war that
occurred in different countries. But it is more important to draw up a
much more global balance-sheet of the forces that existed during the struggle
against the war, and we must cry out the truth that imposes itself and
that we must recognize: the proletariat has been incapable of stopping
the war, and especially on the side of the Coalition; capitalism reached
its objectives of national mobilization and of the submission of the proletarians
to the interests of the national States. Indeed, it is more important to
stress this, than to mention the number of national flags that were burnt,
the international leaflets that have been circulated, the schools that
have been occupied (like in Italy and in Spain), the occupation of/or demos
against recruitment offices, the number of deserters that have fled.
<p>For us this general situation is logical, since counter-revolution is
dominating on a nearly generalized scale, and in such a context we are
rather glad that some violent actions against the war did take place. But
the situation is really tragic, and every apology of some acts of resistance
as if the proletariat finds itself in a revolutionary period, can only
serve counter-revolution. We have to start out from this very elementary
truth, that cannot be hidden: hour after hour, day after day, week after
week, we were unable to stop one of the largest massacres in history, one
that can be compared to the massacres in Hiroshima, Nagasaki or Dresden
during the second world war. The massacre of our brothers took place while
the bourgeoisie placed the world proletariat in front of the television
screens so as to show them the horrible spectacle!
<p>In relation to the weakness that we already talked about concerning
the army of the Iraqi State, we must stress that the strength and coherence
of the Coalition armies is shocking, especially as far as the passive but
massive support by the rear-guard for these armies is concerned. The strength
of the armies of the main international watchdogs of Capital lies within
the weakness of the struggle of the proletariat in these countries.
<p>It is obvious that the fact that nearly all deaths were only on one
side, and that on the side of the Coalition the war did not cost much in
terms of life or in terms of survival (the increase in misery cannot be
compared to what happened on the other side), all this facilitated national
unity, the submission of the proletariat to its own State, and the coherence
of the armies of the US-led Coalition. The existing correlation of counterrevolutionary
forces could only be put into question if the proletariat of the Coalition
countries had also had to support the burden of the war, and if, on top
of an intensification of the austerity-policies in those countries, thousands
of plastic bags "bringing home" the "heroic freedom fighters" had arrived
at the airports of the Coalition countries. In today's circumstances, when
the "bourgeois" and "proletarians" are together celebrating the allied
military victory, sharing the same criminal satisfaction about the fact
that the victims remained in Iraq and Kuwait, in such circumstances it
is counterrevolution itself that can fortify the perception of the proletariat
as an organic and single body, by the exacerbation of the misery it causes!
<p>So we must assume this sad reality where the international proletariat
is standing, incapable of stopping the war (and we must remember that the
most important limit to the Vietnam war, was the North-American proletariat
itself!) or even of assuming really important actions of struggle against
it! We do not want to devalorize the actions of some proletarians who refused,
e.g., in certain harbours, to load arms to be sent to the Gulf region,
nor the violent actions against this or that center for recruitment in
the USA, but it is tragic that there was no uprising amongst the troops
that were sent to fight on behalf of the Coalition; it is tragic that there
were only a few tens of deserters (while on the other side, there were
several tens of thousands!), that there were no important attacks against
official buildings of the Coalition forces; it is tragic that the military
production, as well as production in general, did not get paralyzed, so
as to fight against the criminal politics of our "own" States. And finally,
the most tragic of all is the terrible state of atomized individuals to
which large parts of the proletariat are reduced today, sitting in front
of a television screen, or participating in some pacifist demo that reinforces
the national mobilization and the military actions of the imperialist State.
<p>Without any doubt, one of the most difficult problems to solve, as well
in the past as for the future of the worldwide revolution, is this tragic
difference between the development of the struggle in one or another country:
this is how the bourgeoisie can afford to send troops from one country
to repress the insurrection that is going on in another country, as it
happened so many times in history, transforming the proletariat in one
country into the accomplice of the State repressing the proletariat elsewhere.
There is no doubt about the fact that the trajectory of the States of the
Coalition and more specifically of the North-American State, as well as
the present affirmations (practical and military, as well as in all official
speeches) as the international police force of the State of "International
Law", designate these States to be the watchdogs against insurrectionary
movements in other countries. In the struggle against this, the responsibility
of the proletariat in these specific countries is obvious. But this also
requires the necessity for a general staff of the international proletariat,
the importance of the centralisation of the proletarian community of struggle
based on the communist programme. In relation to this, the critique of
the complete failure -through opportunism, centrism, euro-centrism, federalism,
nationalism- of the Third International (that, from the 2nd Congress onward,
adopted the tactic of national liberation that objectively divided the
proletariat and this way became the accomplice of the bourgeoisie) is essential.
<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">The situation in Iraq</font></u></h2>
On the Iraqi side, defeatism was general. We already described how the
Iraqi State sent tens of thousands of proletarians in uniform to the front,
to serve as cannon-fodder. But in the face of this situation, the proletariat
did not remain passive. Struggles occurred even before the beginning of
the bombings by the Coalition armies. In Mossoul, in the North of Iraq,
in Kurdistan, people rioted against the famine that resulted from the "war
restrictions" that had been imposed jointly by the Iraqi State and the
Coalition. In Sulaimaniya, in the North also, demos against the war were
organized by women. The Republican Guards intervened and fired at the crowd.
300 women were arrested and executed a bit later. But in the South of Iraq
also, the situation remained very tense in the face of the perspectives
of the bombings and the launching of this war, in which proletarians knew
they had nothing to win.
<p>So even before the launching of the terrestrial offensive, the general
situation in Iraq was very explosive, and for this reason, for fear of
an insurrection, Saddam Hussein made thousands of leaflets to be thrown
down by airplane, recalling the Halabja massacre. This is how he wanted
proletarians who were ready to rise up against him, to remember that the
State would not hesitate to bomb or gas them if they refused to submit
themselves to his war-plans. Saddam Hussein did not have time to execute
his threaths since the Coalition offensive was launched even before he
could put down this defeatist resistance.
<p>This is how, from the very moment that the warplanes from the Coalition
had started dropping their tons of bombs on the South of Iraq at first,
crushing the proletarians who were hiding in shelters or in caves, these
proletarians started moving up to Baghdad, fleeing the areas of famine
and desolation; they were immediately joined by thousands of starved deserters.
In the face of this situation, the Iraqi State had no other solution but
to move more reliable troops from the North into the area to prevent these
thousands of proletarians from fleeing to Baghdad. But while moving these
more loyal troops to the South, the Iraqi State destabilized even more
the situation in the North, where the uprisings were the most violent,
straight after the terrestrial offensive.
<p>This resistance of proletarians in Iraq and the defeatism they were
capable of -even before the launching of the terrestrial offensive- were
the first cause for the ending of the war between the Coalition and Iraq.
Even more so since on the front, right after the beginning of the war,
tens of thousands of other proletarians surrendered and refused to sacrifice
their blood for the imperialist crusade of Saddam. During these few days
when the Republican Guards had to confront an enemy that was really armed,
one could easily see that their eagerness to fight was much weaker than
when they were fighting proletarians who refused to go to the battlefields.
On this occasion, tens of thousands of proletarians got completely "out
of control", and at the same time when they were fighting for their own
survival while attacking private property, they were clashing with their
enemy of always, their "own" State.
<p>From the first days of March 1991, the news agencies of the whole world
had to mention the attacks and arson of official buildings and Baath' party
buildings, but as we already mentioned, the struggle did not start nor
did it end here: as a matter of fact, a real tendency for generalization
existed. The press mentioned only certain attacks by the proletariat against
the State in Iraq, in order to better justify the Coalition's massive massacres
as a "public health operation". The Coalition wanted the actions against
the war, the desertions of proletarians, the uprisings against famine,...
to be depicted as struggles against a detested tyrant, and not as a more
general struggle against capitalist war. For the State organized around
the Coalition, the biggest danger lies in a possible contamination of these
defeatist struggles within its own army. In the face of a generalization
of the desertions and struggles in Iraq, the soldiers of the Coalition
could easily have become aware that they were not fighting against thousands
of fanatic "Saddamised" terrorists, as they had been made to believe, but
that they were in fact participating in a butchery that had been organised
against the masses of proletarians in Iraq and in Kuwait.
<p>The worldwide bourgeoisie had a feeling of general terror when considering
the possibility that the defeatism against the State of Saddam Hussein
might affirm itself as revolutionary defeatism. This is one of the reasons
that made Bush decide -in spite of the many international calls for the
destruction of the complete military potential of Saddam- to stop the war
only a few days after having launched the battle against the Republican
Guards. This is how he tried to ensure the integrity of this anti-proletarian
and repressive organ, the Republican Guard. General Kelly declared explicitly:
<blockquote><i>"It is a defeated army that is going back home. A beaten
army always constitutes a political threat."</i></blockquote>
The Washington Post itself reproduced declarations by Iraqi bourgeois opposition
leaders that were in contradiction with the general analysis which pretended
that what was going on, was a national or religious problem. For instance,
this paper reproduced the following declarations by Muhammad Bahr Ulum:
<blockquote><i>"This is not a religious problem, but the first popular
uprising in 20 years against the reign of Saddam Hussein. His defeat in
Kuwait has broken the reign of terror."</i></blockquote>
And as a matter of fact, while they were trying once more to make us believe
that the struggles that erupted after the war are about religious problems,
or even about national questions -as far as the Kurdistan area is concerned-
we know, as far as we are concerned, that these struggles are much more
the direct continuity of the struggles that occurred before and during
the war.
<p>And for this reason, the Coalition's interest was for Saddam Hussein
to assume himself the continuity of repression organized by the means of
the Republican Guards.
<p>Uprisings took place nearly everywhere, as soon as the war stopped.
Bassorah, in the South, Mossoul, Arbil, Kirkouk, Sulaimania, in the North,
were in a state of insurrection. The rest of the defeated army, the deserters,
the inhabitants of the cities, united themselves to cry out their anger
and hatred of the State in the face of those who had sent them to war.
In the South, clashes were particularly violent, but the Republican Guards
were prepared for it: they had already been concentrated in this region
because the State knew very well the explosive situation that prevailed
here. In the North, Saddam hoped for some respite since he knew he could
count on the nationalists. He hoped that they would be capable of framing
up and defeating the proletariat, and he knew for sure that they would
not engage in any action against him. Indeed, from the very beginning of
the war, Saddam Hussein and the nationalist parties had reached some secret
agreement via the PLO and its beloved leader, Yasser Arafat, guaranteeing
the pacific coexistence between these two bourgeois factions for the whole
duration of the war. This is why repression first hit struggles in the
South.
<p>But the uprisings in the North took place in spite of all official "opposition",
and in spite of and against the KDP, PUK and all other Kurdish nationalist
organizations. From the very start, these factions were recognized as being
"war-participationists" and their attempts to frame up the insurgents by
putting forward nationalist perspectives, did not work out. Other groups
rose up, such as "Communist Perspective" in Sulaimania, an internationalist
organization that resulted from the lessons of the preceding struggles.
And other groups as well, all more or less formal, and which all clearly
designated the nationalists as enemies as dangerous as the`Republican Guard.
The insurgent proletarians refused to let nationalists enter the cities.
The latter then tried to encircle the cities, meeting this way many soldiers
on their way home from the front. These soldiers did not want to fight
any more, but on several occasions, the nationalists forced them to join
their ranks and fight. As one can see, a nation-to-be uses the same terrorist
methods as the nation it is fighting against. Here, Saddam Hussein and
Talabani stand hand in hand to send proletarians to the front at gunpoint.
The encircling of the cities by the nationalist parties, allowed them to
make the world believe that they were "in control" of these cities; but
the only control that they actually assumed, was the control of the repression
of proletarians returning home from the front. These pieces of information
that have been reported directly to us by contacts, sympathisers and comrades
from that region, are corroborated by the fact that Talabani e.g., the
boss of the PUK, has not been able to return to Sulaimania even though
this city was considered to be his stronghold before.
<p>It is exactly in this city, that the insurrection was particularly violent:
here proletarians took revenge for years and years of massacres and organized
terror that they had been submitted to. They attacked the terrifying secret
police of Saddam Hussein, killing some 2,000 Baathists, who were hiding
in the buildings of the political police. The anger of our fellow proletarians
turned against everything that represented the Iraqi State, as they burnt,
looted and entirely demolished all buildings belonging to the police, to
the Baath' party, courts, etc. During all this time, the nationalist parties
tried to oppose this, arguing that the material that could be found in
these buildings, would be useful to the future Kurdish State!
<p>To put down this generalized proletarian revolt, Saddam Hussein sent
his most loyal troops to clear the region, after Bassorah and the other
insurgent cities of the South had been crushed! As soon as the Republican
Guards got closer to the North, and as the first reports about their atrocities
arrived, as soon as the proletariat realized that the Republican Guards
had succeeded partially in crushing the South and that white terror was
coming up North, towards the Kurdistan region, as soon as the insurgents
realized that the Coalition armies had left the Republican Guard nearly
unharmed and in any case sufficiently powerful to organize the terror against
them, they withdrew from the cities towards the mountains, with their arms,
luggage, children, trying to escape by all possible means the repressive
hell that was about to hit them. We already gave some examples of the violence
with which the insurgents struggled against local authorities and it is
easy to understand that they expected the worst of the Republican Guards.
For tens of years they had been submitted to the repression by the shock
troops of the Iraqi regime, and they knew they should not expect any mercy
of them.
<p>The whole of the information was transmitted to us directly by comrades
from that region who had participated in these struggles. We do not possess
yet all the details about the different clashes and confrontations that
we have mentioned (one can easily imagine all the difficulties for these
comrades to communicate with us, in view of the horror of the defeat that
they are submitted to today!), but of course we will continue to centralize
all the information that these comrades will give us. As soon as the war
started and at the very moment when the bombings started, these comrades
also circulated an "appeal against the war" that was produced by our group,
in Arabic. Other material produced by our group was also circulated, before
and during the war.
<p>A few days after the "anniversary" of the Halabja massacre, while the
struggle was fully going on, particularly in the North of Iraq, in the
Kurdistan region, our group sent a leaflet there, in Kurdish, which was
also circulated in the area. Here are some excerpts from this leaflet that
was called: "No Kurdish nation! No Islamic republic!" and that focused
mainly on the critique of nationalism, in all its forms.
<blockquote><i>"The Halabja massacre and all other filthy nationalist actions
are the arms of democracy (...) The proletarians and the exploited from
Kurdistan, as all the exploited of the world, can only abolish misery by
turning their guns against the Kurdish nationalists and by treating them
the same way as they have been treating the Baathist State. The bourgeois
are our enemy, wherever they may be. So, what can be the difference that
the nationalists make between "the external enemy", the "momentaneous enemy",
the "main enemy", small or big? (...) The Halabja massacre is the direct
result of the law of this class society, as history has proved us a thousand
times. As soon as the revolutionary movement fights against Capital and
its nationalists, as soon as Capital loses control, the only response by
the bourgeoisie will be the massacre of proletarians!</i></blockquote>

<dir><i>History has given us many examples: Kronstadt and Petrograd in
Russia, Dresden in Germany, Sabra and Shatila by Israel and the Arab States,
Halabja by the Baathist party... without mentioning all the examples that
have been hidden from us.</i></dir>

<blockquote><i>The official media of the whole world, together with all
types of Marxist-Leninist groups, have collected money in the name of the
Halabja massacre by spreading their lies about these events. In this job,
all their lies have been cautioned by the dogs Talabani (PUK) and Houshiar
Zebari (KDP) (...) The nationalist bourgeois have prevented the population
of Halabja from leaving the city before the chemical bomb attacks, while
letting their own relatives and militants go (...) Capital itself engenders
war, misery, illness and repression. The Halabja massacre is the direct
product of money and work. This massacre has been perpetuated with the
help of the Western countries. They arranged themselves to put all the
blame on Saddam Hussein, while putting their horrible pictures in their
papers. (...).</i></blockquote>

Taking into account the insurrectionary movements that spontaneously shook
many Iraqi cities, before, during and especially after the war, one can
easily understand why the Coalition powers did not have any interest in
completely destroying the Republican Guard, once they were sure about their
own victory. If the Coalition army had destroyed the Republican Guard,
then it would have been up to them to confront the insurgents and to ensure
social peace and this would have implied a very high political and military
cost for them. On top of this, none of the other bourgeois factions in
Iraq represents a valuable alternative for the main power involved in the
Gulf war: the imperialist giant called USA.
<p>Kurdish nationalist autonomy is being considered to be too destabilizing
for the whole region, and besides -as soon as the outcome of its military
confrontation with Iraq was clear- the Pentagon stopped flirting with the
Kurdish nationalist leaders. In the same manner, Washington is considering
the establishment of an Iran-like Islamic republic to be dangerous and
contradictory with the other imperialist interests in that region. This
is why, during the decisive days when the fall of Saddam Hussein seemed
most likely, all observers were surprised once more by the support the
Coalition powers gave to the Iraqi leader whom only a few days earlier
they had called "the new Hitler". For us, this stands as an additional
proof for our analysis of Capital, as far as the fragility of inter-imperialist
alliances is concerned. For sure, the Coalition would prefer the same Baathist
party to maintain law and order in Iraq, but headed by somebody with more
credibility than Saddam Hussein.
<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">The war and its perspective</font></u></h2>
It is the proletariat that constituted the real limit of the war, and above
all, the proletariat in Iraq that broke national unity and assumed defeatist
struggles. But the limit was also made up by proletarians from other countries
who did not participate in the imperialist crusade that Saddam and some
others -under the cover of anti-imperialism- had called for. The disequilibrium
between imperialist powers was such that it became impossible to continue
generalized war.
<p>Nevertheless, from the point of view of the US and of its allies, the
whole operation did bring about a positive political and military outcome,
especially because of the lack of struggle and of proletarian autonomy
against the war. A bourgeois outcome of course, not only in relation to
the commercial business of the war (who would still buy Russian tanks today?)
but also and especially, because of the national and international mobilization
and because of the reconstitution and consolidation of the spirit of the
most important military power in the world!
<p>From the latter point of view, the war has reached the capitalist and
imperialist objectives that were searched for. However, from the most global
point of view, from the point of view of the general need for destruction,
which will only serve to open a new phase of reconstruction and expansion,
there is no doubt about the fact that the Gulf war was completely inadequate.
However lucrative the commercial deals are, the ones that many different
factions of Capital contracted during the war and during the period of
reconstruction in this area, the destructions caused by the war were very
small compared to today's necessities for the destruction of capital.
<p>Capitalism needs war still a lot more. This is why we insist that much
on the actual limits of the war, because the tendency for a more generalized
war remains acute. And nobody can guarantee that today's limits of this
war will also be the limits capable of preventing the generalisation of
another war tomorrow. The difference between today's blocs and the lack
of adhesion to one of them, cannot be a permanent limit for other wars
to come. As a matter of fact, because of the rapidity in the changing of
interbourgeois alliances -engendered by the depression and today's crisis-
and also because of the experience from this last war that will push the
weaker factions of the bourgeoisie into making concession to an even higher
degree so as to reinforce their bloc and engage into military actions -
one can foresee the coming of more equally balanced polarizations, in terms
of military power, that will be much more dangerous for the world proletariat.
In the future war, there will not be on one side a giant and on the other
side a dwarf, but there will be two opposed giants, and not only in military
terms, but also in terms of the power that derives from the different myths
about the "causes to defend the nation".
<p>Here we have to mention that the weakness of Saddam Hussein does not
exclude the possible coming of much more radical factions that will be
capable of raising the banner of "third world" ideology or radical anti-imperialism
in a much more coherent manner. These factions would also be capable of
giving rise to a popular mobilization of the entire nation for waging war
in a much less conventional way and therefore in a much more murderous
way in regard to the troops of the main imperialist watchdog. Neither can
we discard at all the possibility that there might be a more general decomposition
of the stronger bloc in this war and the birth of new polarizations between
the main industrial powers, including from within the bossom of each country.
We cannot either discard the possibility that the standards of international
trade will completely explode, opposing e.g. the bourgeois factions in
favour of the complete application of the law of international value to
other more protectionist factions. Such a polarization would be the most
logical and profound one to develop during the coming years: however, it
will only become a material force if it manages to crystallize itself in
a discourse capable of mobilizing the masses and of inducing the proletariat
to kill and die for the fatherland. Such a polarization will appear with
completely different discourses and ideological justifications (we discard
the reappearance of the old fascism/anti-fascism form) which, however,
are not ripe yet.
<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">Our action against war, for the centralisation
of all international forces</font></u></h2>
We are not creators of parties, nor do we create "Internationals". We start
from the existing reality of which our group is also a product. However,
by reappropriating the historical program of our class and Party, we try
to transform ourselves to become active factors, i.e. organised, disciplined,
conscious agents.
<p>The community of struggle against capitalism and war is an objective
reality that emerges from the interests of the proletariat in opposition
to the interests of Capital, its economy, its wars. With its strength and
its weaknesses, the common action of the proletariat forges it as a class,
as a unified force. The ICG is an expression of this process and it fights,
on the highest possible international level, to centralise this force,
so as to build up an international direction according to the interests
of the proletariat and the historical program of communism.
<p>We repeat here each one of our calls for revolutionary defeatism and
for the organisation of the community of struggle against the war. This
is why we advise our readers, who have not read all our publications, to
read more in particular the following issues of the French language review
"Communisme" (before "Le Communiste"): 7, 25, 27 and 29 in which we have
developed a whole series of appeals and propositions. In very concrete
terms of activity, our group proposed in all these texts:

<li>
the coordination of the internationalist activity together with the whole
of organisations and proletarian groups that fight against the war, to
turn back our arms against those who send us to war, for revolutionary
defeatism.</li>

<li>
the organisation of the circulation of information about struggles of this
kind, and especially about the Middle East, in view of the very explosive
character of the contradiction between war and revolution in this area.</li>

<li>
to reinforce and centralise the different networks for the survival of
proletarians in struggle, prisoners, fugitives, exiles,...</li>

<li>
to circulate the different texts and material in different areas of the
world, such as texts about the struggles and other internationalist activities,
as well as more historical texts that lay out the never changing perspectives
of communism.</li>
</ul>
Whatever might be the immediate developments of the war situation in this
region, the Gulf war has re-actualized the contradiction of always: war
or revolution, capitalist civilization or communism, and therefore it has
given more validity than ever to our plans and proposals.
<p>During the war itself, we experienced the general weakness of our class
in everything we have tried to organise or to encourage. While it was important
to take up and circulate different information, while deserters and fugitives,
in different places, had to be backed up, or also, in order to assume on
a larger level some direct action of propaganda and agitation against the
war, we were objectively very isolated, mainly here in Western Europe,
since we already mentioned how defeatism in Iraq did allow for more centralised
action.
<p>As there do not exist any larger class organs to participate in in order
to promote and reinforce revolutionary defeatism, as there do not exist
any forms of coordination of proletarian action against the war, we had
to limit ourselves, here in Europe, to the organisation of some action
of propaganda, and this is how, with our own forces as well as with some
of our close contacts, we circulated leaflets and reviews, and we produced
and put up posters. For us, communist militants, it is a real tragedy that
our class was led to die and to kill, without putting up any massive or
significant resistance; it is a real tragedy that - in the hour of truth
- when it was necessary to prevent the depparture of troops and assume massive
and violent action against the enemy "in our own country", we found ourselves
to be alone, we, the comrades of the ICG together with some other militants
and close sympathizers, and with a balance of forces that was completely
paralysing.
<p>Denying this sad reality, denying the impressive force of counter-revolution
today, comes down to being its accomplice! From our point of view, this
terrible reality does not discourage us. It confirms the invariant road
we are following, the struggle of always, against the stream and far away
from all popularity.
<p>Today capitalism is stronger than ever. Nevertheless, it has not been
able to avoid depression, crisis, and neither will it be able to avoid
complete bankruptcy tomorrow, nor a new merciless commercial war that will
finish in a new war altogether. Capital has bypassed partially one imperialist
contradiction, but it continues to exacerbate the whole of the general
contradictions of its system. Sooner or later, the contradiction WAR or
REVOLUTION will polarize once more the entire world. Everything that is
being done to diminish or postpone the contradictions, in fact only delays
the moment when these contradictions will explode, when they will again
come to the forefront of the international scene, but with much more power
still!
<p>Sooner or later also, with this new and inevitable explosion, the proletariat
that has been so absent as an international autonomous class during the
ultimate convulsions, will again stand at the centre of the historical
scene, and again the contradictions of capitalist society will fuse in
the contradiction between war and revolution, between capitalism and communism.

<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">Revolutionary defeatism in Iraq</font></u></h2>
In the last chapter, we wrote that as long as comrades in Iraq can manage
to get information to us, we intend to continue to centralize information
from the region. Since then, we received new information directly from
comrades and proletarians, some of them writing from the front line of
action. They want to make it understood, as soon as possible, what situation
they have been faced with. The new details confirm and reinforce our previous
conclusions: proletarian revolutionary defeatism and autonomous struggle
against all capitalist factions, including nationalist and islamic factions,
was extremely significant.
<p>We have attempted to put the main points down in this chapter. We apologize
for the relatively disorganised and sometimes bitty presentation - bear
in mind that some of this information was obtained by very indirect means,
by communication with comrades and proletarians, some of them in the midst
of armed confrontation with the State.
<center>
<h2>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">oOo</font></h2></center>
We have already mentioned that significant proletarian struggles against
the State had already broken out before the star of the war: food riots,
anti-war demos, etc... we have now got further information on the situation
and the state of mind of soldiers and proletarians in general, before the
allied bombing began.
<p>As a result of the Iran/Iraq war, it is difficult for the State to control
the area, particularly the cities. Ten years of war have literally armed
the majority of proletarians. The marshlands, for example, have become
an area of convergence for deserters and other proletarians. Soldiers who
have been fighting for ten years will no longer put up with a system now
demanding taxes or a boss or foreman giving orders. Moreover, in glorifying
soldiers returning from the battle front (indispensable war propaganda),
the State indirectly encouraged insubordination and resistance to its control
over daily life. It responded in a confused manner to try to maintain social
peace, but was unable to halt disobedience and generalized disorganisation.
<p>In Baghdad itself, before the bombings, everyone was preparing to flee
the city and there was a flourishing trade in forged laissez-passer documents,
organisation of hide-outs, etc. Everyone had organised their desertion
well in advance of the first bomb dropping on the city: privates, but also
some officers who had ripped off their stripes and were sometimes the first
to leave. The biggest barracks in Baghdad began to empty as the first shells
fell and not a single shot was heard in defence of the barracks. There
were desertions and officers were executed. Soldiers and other proletarians
made up a corps of shock troopers fighting the Baathist forces. During
the war, they managed to gain control of two areas of the city: Al Sourah
and Al Sho'ela. Within Baghdad, these areas became magnets for further
deserters. Hundreds of soldiers from all over the country escaped from
the main barracks in Baghdad and went to such supportive districts, whose
inhabitants enabled them to return to their homes, by providing them with
rest, food and civilian clothes.
<p>As the threat of a new war became more and more real, resistance to
it took on various forms - from passive reaction to violent and armed action
against army recruiters. A decisive role was again played by <b>the core
of armed proletarians</b>, who responded so significantly to the Iran/Iraq
war. Before and during the war, they directed resistance against the military
at various levels and were now able to transform initial passive resistance
(refusal to sign up, to accept superiors' orders, to go to the front -
often supported by the family and friends) into conscious military confrontation
with recruiters and others supporting the army.
<p>As always, executions of a few officers carried out by the most resolute
minority were initially not openly supported by proletarian conscripts.
Although they sympathized with this kind of action, state campaigns against
defeatism were still maintaining state terrorism. However, they gradually
overcame their fear and executions of officers reached massive scales.
Soldiers carried out mass lynching of "their own officers" and it got to
a stage where the hierarchy required for cohesion of the army no longer
existed. Officers were terrified and lost the balance of power. Soldiers
did whatever they wanted and the officers were reduced to apologizing and
asking forgiveness. They tried to pretend that they were also against the
war and had nothing to do with re-mobilization.
<p>The situation within the army became so chaotic that when the Allied
military offensive began, officers ripped the stripes off their uniforms
for fear of being recognized and executed on the spot by the masses of
deserters. To be seen wearing stripes meant suicide.
<p>At various strategic points in the South defeatist units went even further
- attacking official party headquarters, ooccupying food warehouses and
distributing the food to starving proletarians. They destroyed the secret
police headquarters, killing hundreds of policemen. Uprising developed
in Basra, Naseriyah and Diwaniyah. Historically, deserters and other proletarians
in hiding from the State are concentrated in this area. In previous issues
we wrote about military offensive carried out by the Iraqi State on the
marshlands a year after the Iran/Iraq war, which resulted in the death
of thousands. At that time government figures estimated 10,000 deserters
hiding in the area. Now they talk of 1 million, 55,000 of which are armed
deserters.
<p>In this part of Iraq, uprisings started as the Allies' land offensive
began. The proletarians' situation became increasingly unbearable due to
massive bombings of Basra, Ammarah, Naseriyah, Najaf and Karbala. Organised
minorities centralized their activities and struggles took place around
all these cities. Contrary to everything that has been said about the religious
nature of the movement, religion played no part in the proletarians' struggle.
Najaf and Karbala are sacred cities for shiites but the uprising had nothing
to do with islam, despite what the bourgeois press try to make us believe.
Proletarians used sacred sites to hang Baathists. Mausoleums were riddled
with bullets and angry proletarians pissed in the mosques. Difficult, therefore,
to talk of "religious fanaticism"!
<p>The Allies had reached the gates of Najaf and Karbala at the time of
the uprisings there. It is clear that they halted the land offensive to
permit the Iraqi Army to carry out an attack on the insurgents.
<p>As the Iraqi Army descended on the cities, chaos ensued and deserters
fled in all directions. Some asked for asylum and aid from the Allied troops
but were told "we'll give you something to drink if you're thirsty, but
only in exchange for your weapons." They were then sent back, unarmed,
to the city to be massacred - one example of collaboration between Saddam
and the Allies against the uprising.
<p>We have already described how Saddam recalled his troops posted in the
North when large units of armed proletarians from the South began to advance
towards Baghdad, thus increasing the disorganisation of the State in Kurdistan.
<p>Thousands of militants from various regions converged in the North -
Turks from Kirkuk, Iranians who had fled the war and repression at the
time in Iran, etc... As cities such as Halabja and Qal'at Dizah had been
decimated by Saddam a few years before, they took refuge around Suleimaniya
(there were more than 70,000 proletarians organizing themselves into radical
groups for self-defence, struggle against state control, against Kurdish
or other nationalists). This mixture of proletarians, with varying horizons
and experiences, produced a situation in which Kurdish nationalist held
very little sway, their usual slogans "Freedom for the Kurdish people"
and "Rights for the Kurds" having little effect on the march uprising in
Suleimaniya.
<p>In order to counter the large scale uprisings in cities such as Arbil,
Kirkuk, Mosul and Suleimaniya... that started with the launching of the
land offensive, Saddam signed an agreement for peaceful coexistence with
the nationalists. Yalal Talabani; leader of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan
(PUK) and Massoud Barsani, leader of the Kurdish Democratic Party (KDP),
announced publicly in April and May 1991 that they had reached an agreement
with Saddam Hussein. Even more recently, Talabani confirmed that during
the war his organisation deliberately avoided taking any action liable
to destabilize the State "out of national respect", guaranteeing a mutual
respect for territory under the violent monopoly of whichever force. We
now know that the "People's Mujahedin" of Iran also took part in these
agreements and that their shock troops were used against the proletarian
uprising.
<p>In the North, proletarian struggle was outside of and opposed to the
official nationalist opposition parties, such as KDP and PUK, from the
outset. The internationalist and defeatist proletarian vanguard denounced
them as <u>participating</u> in the war.
<p>We now have further information on the context and conditions in which
confrontations with the State took place, particularly during the March
uprising in Suleimaniya. Before coming on to this, we would like to mention
further news we have about a women's demo in Suleimaniya during which 300
women were arrested and later killed. The demo turned violent when a militant
woman from Iran tried to take a soldier's gun off him and was shot dead
by another soldier on a watchtower. This militant has now become a symbol
of proletarian struggle against war and State, a recognized martyr reflecting
the image of struggle in Suleimaniya. It is of no consequence to proletarians
from Iraq that she was from Iran - what counts is what she did. We have
not told this story as an anecdote, but because it expresses the anti-nationalist
content of the movement, rising out of a struggle in which proletarians
no longer walk in the gutter bourgeois ideology digs to make proletarians
confront each other as Iraqis, Iranians, Kurds, shiites...
<center>
<h2>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">oOo</font></h2></center>
Despite the media's insistence on the entirely spontaneous nature of the
uprising in Suleimaniya, it is now clear that it was the result of intense
organisation undertaken by vanguard minorities. Their militant activity
was intense in the six months before the uprising. A group called Communist
Perspective was formed and their publication, "The Proletarian", was distributed
mainly amongst militants. Links between militants had been severely limited
over the years due to repression and the memory of recent massacres. Militants
organised themselves in secret. When riots broke out during the occupation
of Kuwait, comrades from Communist Perspective organized debates with other
militant minorities. In the course of analyzing the situation and "what
should be done", the Shura ("Shura" means "workers' council" in Persian
and Kurdish) movement was born. Initially there were about 300 militants
(from both Iran and Iraq) who decided to organize themselves, homogenize
their positions, deal with technical and medical problems, commandeer weapons,...
<p>In Suleimaniya, they decided to attack on the 8th of March at 13h00.
Groups were formed and given specific targets - barracks, police stations,
secret police and information headquarters, the "United Nations Hotel"
(a hotel used by the United Nations, but which turned out to be a secret
police base), main entrances to the city and surrounding areas to prevent
nationalists and journalists from entering,... All proletarians were delighted
with this course of action - tensions had been running for the a while
and everyone was expecting something to happen. The army could sense the
growing hatred and tension and was forecasting that something would blow.
Nevertheless, the offensive on Suleimaniya took them by surprise - the
city was attacked from all sides simultaneously.
<p>Our comrades have given us specific examples of how the groups of internationalist
insurgents were themselves overtaken by proletarian mass action, driven
by their class interests and hatred. This occurs in any insurrectional
process and is illustrated by events as a few hundred armed revolutionaries
advanced into Suleimaniya and were greeted by the masses of proletarians,
all carrying weapons. The proletarians' sole objective was to violently
impose their own interests on their oppressors and, in order to do so,
much to the surprise of the revolutionary insurgents, they had managed
to arm themselves not only with light hand guns, but also heavy artillery,
and were preparing to use them against the State.
<p>In the course of the attack of the city, more and more proletarians
joined the fighting. When the barracks were taken over, arms were distributed
to proletarians prepared to fight. They were given orders to attack milk
stores (milk had been rationed), prisons and to release prisoners. Anyone
in military uniform was massacred on the spot.
<p>The uprising was particularly violent, proletarians taking revenge for
the years of massacre and organized state terrorism. They attacked Saddam's
secret police force.
<p>After two days of fighting the hide-out of political police fell into
the hands of the insurgents. Fighting was very violent as the highly trained
soldiers defended the building. Victory was won as increasing numbers of
proletarians joined the battle and hundreds of Baathist police hiding in
the building were killed.
<p>The occupation of Suleimaniya got underway starting with the reappropriation
of machines, secret documents and weapons and this explains the comments
of some nationalist leaders reported in western newspapers:
<blockquote><i>"Disorder benefits none, there are undoubtedly agitators
amongst those sowing the seeds of disorder... they are destroying everything,
not only attacking and killing members of Saddam's secret police which
is understandable but they are also burning all police files and registers
of property and civil status... It is clear to us that agitators, Baathists
are responsible, because, as you imagine, we will need all this later -
every state organisation needs these documents!"</i></blockquote>
What these bourgeois fail to understand or better put, arose not to admit,
is that the aim of the revolt was not to reorganise the state and capital's
administration, or to liberate the nation, but like every significant proletarian
insurrection, <b>the struggle is against the State itself</b> and aims
to attack all of its manifestations - military, police, public buildings,
parties and security and property documents.
<p>On hearing that the Baathists had hidden in a park outside the town,
proletarians descended on it shouting:
<blockquote>
<h3>
<i>"Long live Shura, abolish the State!"</i></h3>
</blockquote>

<dir>
<h3>
<i>"We want soviets!"</i></h3>
</dir>
Slogans supporting "Kurdish autonomy" are practically non-existent. Proletarians
organised into militia to prevent Peshmergas (fighters of nationalist organisations)
from entering Suleimaniya. It is clear to all the insurgents that the nationalists
are working hand in hand with Saddam.
<p>The nationalists went on to Kirkuk to take control of the city. They
arrived first, but were closely followed by militants from the Shura, armed
to the teeth. In Kirkuk the PUK and KDP are in the majority and with the
balance of power in their favour, they fought against the government and
the Shura.
<p>The agreement between Saddam and the nationalists to quell the rebellion,
includes a proviso that "Arabs" (deserters from the South who took part
in the uprisings in the North) be returned to "their own" area.
<p>After the uprisings "Free Kurdish Radio" made daily broadcasts threatening
those in possession of arms or Shura leaflets with execution.
<p>A rift developed between Communist Perspective and the Shura, due to
disagreements on positions. However we do not have any details of this.
The split demobilized and distanced many proletarian sympathizers, although
solidarity was maintained between the groups in the face of nationalist
repression.
<p>Briefly, the Shura can be described as an internationalist proletarian
organisation, opposed to Kurdish or other nationalists. It fights to strengthen
the revolutionary movement, not only in Iraq, but throughout the world.
It defines capital as a worldwide social relationship which can therefore
only be abolished worldwide by a world revolution (9).
<p>After the uprising the movement died down a bit and the Shura went underground
again to escape massacre.
<p>The army and the nationalists retook Suleimaniya in mid-April. The alliance
between the government and the nationalists was perfect - the nationalists
denounce the militants of Shura and give the State all information they
have: names, addresses, activities,...
<p>The Shura called for denunciation of nationalists throughout the world.
The Kurdish nationalists organised a radio campaign, claiming that they
had liberated Kurdistan, that the cities were free thanks to the PUK and
KDP and that their example should be followed to clear the city of anarchists,
troublemakers, etc.
<p>On the 30th and 31st of May there were more riots in Suleimaniya. Looting
was organised and many soldiers gave up their arms out of fear of being
massacred. Government and nationalist forces called for reinforcements.
Despite their hatred of nationalists, the proletarians did not kill them
and the PUK imposed a curfew by shooting at anyone out on the streets after
7pm. In this way, the PUK remained in control of the situation.
<p>Significant proletarian uprisings also took place in Raniyah, Kirkuk
and Arbil. Deserters and armed minority groups played an important part.
These minorities described their position as being against all bourgeois
factions (governmental and nationalist) and were concentrated and trained
in the area of Karadakh. Confrontation between nationalists and internationalists
was open. Internationalist comrades know that defeat is synonymous with
massacre and that nationalist militias act without mercy.
<center>
<h2>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">oOo</font></h2></center>
It is an absolute lie that the Allies only bombed military targets and
"collateral" civilian targets during the Gulf war. There are two possibilities:
either their lies about the Allies' force and technological strength were
even greater than we had thought and wrote about in the previous chapter
of this text, or military installations were not the targets of the bombings
in the first place. We now know, thanks to internationalist comrades in
Iraq, that 80% of the bombings were carried out on civilian targets. We
also know that Iraqi military installations are practically intact and
that chemical weapons and nuclear research centres were left untouched.
Baghdad still has the same capacity for producing chemical weapons and
building nuclear warheads as before the war.
<p>As for the bloody battles in which Allied "heros" and soldiers of the
Republican Guard were engaged, only 5% of the Republican Guard were killed
in the war. Proletarian struggle took a far greater toll on the state cracktroops
than the whole of the Allied offensive.
<p>As it was to be expected, the maintenance of bourgeois order was much
more of a preoccupation and determining factor to the Allies than their
conflicts with "damned Saddam". Today (July 1991), the Republican Guards
still play essential role in the region. There is no doubt that, over and
above their desire to liquidate Saddam, the Pentagon and the most powerful
forces of international capitalism in general, consider the Baath party
to be a good guarantor for order in the region (this not excluding alliances
with nationalist and religious factions - on the contrary). It is clear
that the decision not to attack critical sectors of the Republican Guard
and to stop the war were motivated by the absolute necessity for a local
force capable of guaranteeing social peace. This was illustrated by pictures
broadcast by the media, which they themselves considered surreal, showing
North American marines protecting soldiers and the Republican Guard from
proletarian anger and subversion.
<p>In the same way, fundamentally, humanitarian missions are concentrated
efforts to disarm the proletariat. In the camps the U.N. works with the
nationalists and nothing is done without their agreement. <b>Food is only
given to those who surrender their guns!</b> Nationalists make constant
radio appeals in a sometimes threatening, sometimes reassuring tone of
voice, calling for wanted militants to give themselves up. They read out
their names, say they know where they are hiding and promise them an amnesty
and food in exchange for their weapons... "Humanitarian" aid is thus sold
to those ready to accept State discipline and submission to order... The
Allied forces repay them with a bit of bread and medical attention.
<p>Neither the government, the nationalists, nor the Allied forces managed
to control the situation. This is why they had to form an alliance. The
government sent several patrols out in every northern city and gave them
orders to find proletarians from the South and send them back. But the
situation was so tense that soldiers threw down their weapons and expressed
their solidarity with the proletarians every time one of them refused to
show his identity card.
<p>Out of ignorance - or as a deliberate policy of disinformation - the
proletarian rebellion in the North has become identified with Kurdish nationalism
and that in the South with Iranian State Islam.
<p>Without underestimating the repressive ideological strength of nationalists
and religious forces, we must stress that all struggles described in this
article were organised apart from and against them. They never call for
struggle against the State and actually constitute some of the state's
most reliable defenders.
<h4>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">* 20th April 1991 *</font></h4>

<h3>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">Notes</font></u></h3>
1. These ideologies prevent them from being able to explain the contradictions
and the imperialist wars that made in the past the Russian bourgeois State
oppose the Chinese State, and the latter oppose the Vietnamese State, or
this one oppose Cambodia...! And instead of understanding these contradictions
as being part of the general imperialist contradictions in the struggle
for the raw material, for markets, for good deals,... they give us this
wishy-washy soup in which the determinants are analyzed from the point
of view of the ideologies of the different bourgeois dictators (heirs of
Stalin against heirs of Mao, the latter ones against Ho Shi Min's, these
against Pol Pot's,...). The materialist explanation of opposed economical
interests is substituted for this ideological soup, as if there had ever
been in history one war that might have been explained on the basis of
the ideas of its protagonists!!!
<p>2. It may seem incredible from the Marxist point of view but there has
been a lot of simple-minded persons to consider these divisions stable
and fixed once and for ever and to materialize this belief in the programme
of their organisations. A centrist organisation like the ICC for instance,
does not only consider state capitalism as a new characteristic "dominating
the social life" in "the phase of decadence", of which the example of the
so-called socialist countries is the best demonstration; the ICC does not
only accept the bourgeois ideological division between developed and under-developed
countries, but has also fixed these divisions in its platform for years
and not only do they talk about three worlds like all the politicians,
but also claim to be able to explain all the contradictions and the imperialist
wars thanks to the famous question of the blocks (just like the bourgeois
press does). Therefore, it is quite easy to understand why, just like the
bourgeoisie and its politicians, who spend their time talking about the
collapse of communism, the ICC spends its time explaining the collapse
of the blocks. While, in fact, what it should try to explain is the collapse
of its view of the world.
<p>3. Only a short time before the launching of the land offensive, a military
analysist of the Salomon Brothers Company declared: "The whole of the military
industrial sector is making profits... while only a very small part of
the defensive potentials that have been moved into the Gulf area have gone
into action... when the exhibition on television will start, showing the
tanks, all the land equipment, the Marines with their material, then the
values of the producing companies will undoubtedly rise on the stock exchange
market."
<p>4. See "1984... 1985... 87... 89... pire que pr&eacute;vu - La citoyennisation
de la vie" in "Le Communiste" No.27.
<p>5. It is obvious that we absolutely do not deny that parties and unions,
as real apparatus of the capitalist State, continue to have a fundamental
role to dominate the proletariat and to ensure capital's capacity to send
them to war. We simply want to stress the fact that they are no longer
(as this was the case for instance at the end of last century and until
the second world war in some countries, or even until recently in some
other countries still) at the center of the "collective" life of the worker,
a center for discussion, for meeting, i.e. a reference in regard to the
relations with the outside world. Today, nearly everywhere, because of
the particular form of counterrevolution, this fiction of "collectivity"
does not exist any longer and proletarians have been individualised up
to a point never known before!
<p>6. It is obvious that all ideological construction bases itself on reality
and on the deformation of that reality. In this case, reality means that
for Capital, and therefore for all imperialist sides, nature is only of
little importance (because for all of them, only the law of capital exists
as an immutable law, i.e. the law of the highest rate of profit that dominates
the whole environment). And that's why poor mother nature becomes always
-in wartime as well as in times of peace -- more degraded, be it in the
middle of huge industrial areas, or in the middle of the always growing
desert.
<p>7. As for any other kind of sale of the commodity "workforce", the free
decision is determined by the freedom to face starvation; in this particular
case, by the alternative: to go to war or to starve! In the United States,
since the misery of the lower strata of the proletariat is so violent and
since the possibilities to find a job are nearly inexistent, the only way
to survive is to join the army! This reality affects more particularly
blacks, Portoricans, and also the "sans r&eacute;serves" of Mexican, Central-American...
origins, and that is why there is a much higher proportion of these fractions
of the proletariat in the army than there is in the civil population. But
in spite of this, in spite of the contradictions that derive from this
and in spite of the enormous possibilities for revolt that exist in this
army, it is sure that the coherence of any military body is much superior
when this body is composed of wage-labourers rather than when it has been
composed through forced conscription (as all major wars in history have
shown us!).
<p>8. In the beginning, when this city was conquered by part of the Iraqi
army, North American television talked about a "mosquito bite on an elephant
skin"; but the next day, after the Coalition forces had reconquered the
city, the battle all of a sudden became "an important military victory
for the Coalition!"
<p>9. This is a description of what Al Shura was initially. However, a
widespread "Shura movement" developed with about 54 shuras (workers' councils)
in Suleimaniya, some pro-C.P., some marxist-leninist and some along the
lines of the original Al Shura and Communist Perspective.

On August 1st 1991 there was a loud bang during the night in Tehran and
we heard that a food storage warehouse had been blown up in protest at
delays in distribution of welfare food allowances. People had been waiting
two months for their social security food supplies. Apparently, nighttime
explosions are quite common, public buses being the most frequent targets.
<p>Tehran has 11 million inhabitants and the traffic and activity in the
city at night is busier than most European cities during the day. Nearly
every Iranian we met asked incredulously "why did you come here?," saying
they hate the system and describing how hard life is in Iran. However,
it was difficult to find any written expression of the class struggle.
Comrades living there confirmed that this is the case and explained that
there are Pasdaran ("Revolutionary Guards" - government soldiers) specially
employed to whitewash anti-government and anti-religious graffiti. We were
unable to find any political leaflets or publications either.
<p>The Pasdaran's most visible concern was with the Islamic dress code
for women. Any man in Iran, whether an official Pasdaran or not, can make
himself a self-appointed guardian of Islamic moral values and can reproach
any woman he considers to be flaunting too much of herself. They are on
the street, in the shops, in hotels... always watching to see whose scarf
has slipped too far back or who is not wearing the mandatory socks or tights
under her overcoat. Women "unsuitably dressed" are barred from offices,
museums, will not be served in shops or restaurants.
<p>The only advantage for women in this male-female apartheid is that they
rarely get asked for their identity cards and rarely get searched. The
examples given here actually represent a major relaxation in the dress
code. Previously, women were stoned for showing a strand of hair and black
chardors were obligatory. Now people have gradually pushed back the limits
imposed on them and wear "Western" clothes covered by European-style raincoats
instead of a chardor. They can show their fringe under the headscarf and
men are now allowed to wear short-sleeved shirts. This change is also reflected
in the distinct decrease in public Islamic fervor. Up until 1987, Friday
prayers were held in a major, very long and wide street called Revolution
Street. Thousands and thousands of people would go and the street was closed
to traffic. We went back there one Friday, to find a Mullah preaching himself
hoarse to only eight people, whilst cars and buses drove up and down. The
government knows it can only reverse this trend at its peril.
<p>The atmosphere in Tehran is very tense. Many people have told us that
"Iran is pregnant with revolution," and this is certainly the way it feels.
People are impatient, tempers easily frayed, and they smile and laugh only
rarely. Homelessness, unemployment, food prices, the number of drug-addicts
and, very visibly, the anger of proletarians are on an upward spiral. Almost
everybody we spoke to told us "Life is very difficult here... Everything
is expensive... Our revolution wasn't to bring these bastards to power..."
As one taxi driver said: "Sometimes I am forced to take on so many jobs
that I don't see my wife and children for a whole week and this is certainly
the case for most of my colleagues."
<p>In July 1991 there was a demonstration in which people demanded more
food. They used a slogan "We have become beggars, the Mullahs millionaires."
The demo spread over Tehran, Asfahan and Hamadan. Seven women were killed
in Tehran when they discarded their headscarves. Further demos occurred
on August 18th 1991, and spread over Tuysarkan, Hamadan, Zinjan, Tehran,
and Asfahan. The same slogan was used and there were clashes resulting
in 2000 arrests and 5 deaths in Zinjan, 5 arrests in Asfahan, and a further
50 deaths in Hamadan. In Tehran a demonstrator set fire to the City Hall
and killed the mayor.
<p>As a result of increasing class struggle, the government has become
roughly divided into two main factions - something totally contrary to
the philosophy of the supposedly united "Party of God." Rafsanjani realizes
that liberalization and increased tolerance is necessary to avert another
revolution. Khameini and his followers still favor the hardline approach.
<p>After spending days enquiring about the relative safety of various routes,
we went to Sulaimania.
<p>The border between Iran and Iraq is not marked, with often only a single
Pasdar sitting at an apparently arbitrary place. He is not so much interested
in preventing people crossing or scrutinizing travel documents as he is
in assessing their "bribing potential," searching for hidden dollars and
goods obviously intended for sale in Iraq. He then frightens smugglers
into bribing him to let them pass. This is a further example of the changing
social climate, whereby previous "guardians of Islamic morals," prepared
to kill anyone threatening to corrupt the Muslim State, are now more interested
in personal financial gain. We were not bodysearched - fortunately, as
we had leaflets hidden in our underpants and dollars in our shoes.
<p>The first town we entered, Nizarah, is a devastated area, now full of
refugees from Sulaimania, Kirkuk, and Arbil provinces. There are several
Red Cross and U.N. camps but people overflow in their thousands to the
mountainsides. Their only shelter are lean-tos that they have built out
of branches and leaves.
<p>Between the border and Nizarah, there are two checkpoints manned by
Peshmerga from the Kurdish Front. They levy taxes on smuggled goods and
search for Arabs travelling in the area, most of whom are deserters and
anti-government militants. In their attempts to keep "Arab" and "Kurdish"
communist militants divided, the Peshmerga want to force Arabs out of Kurdistan
(except those they can make use of). It is dangerous for Arabs travelling
around Kurdistan and to gain any degree of protection they have to be able
to prove that they are Peshmerga for the Kurdish Front (KF). The only Party
in the Front that will accept them is the Iraqi CP. Any Arab found by Nationalist
Peshmerga without KF documents is taken prisoner and then handed over to
the Iraqi authorities, most likely to be shot. However, despite the risks
involved, some Arab comrades working with the Shuras do manage to travel
to and from Kurdistan, holding meetings with Kurdish comrades and taking
information back to militants in Baghdad.
<p>When Talabani was in Iran one day in his car he passed many of the refugees
fleeing into Iran. At first nobody realized it was him, but when he stopped
nearby one old woman recognizing him bent down, scooped up a handful of
the mud she was walking barefoot in, and asked him to lean out of the car
window so that she might throw the mud in his face. He remained composed.
"Of course," he replied. "I will do whatever the Mothers of Kurdistan request
of me." The woman dropped the mud and cried limply, "What have we done
to deserve this? Why are you doing this to us?"
<p>Since government-Kurdish Front negotiations, the checkpoints around
Sulaimania are manned by Iraqi soldiers and Peshmerga of the Kurdish Front
(mainly KDP and PUK) working together. The soldiers sent to man checkpoints
and to go on patrols in the Sulaimania district are young conscripts and
are terrified of the Kurdish Front. Firstly, they realize that a breakdown
in negotiations may result in them all being killed in new fighting. Secondly,
they know that if they try to desert, the Kurdish Front will round them
up and send them back to their army units - to a certain death. Thirdly,
and most importantly, the lack of a centralized and well-organized proletarian
group in Kurdistan means that there are very few places to which the soldiers
can turn for solidarity and mutual support.
<p>At the end of July there was further fighting and Kirkuk came back under
the control of the Shuras and other insurgents. Militants found government
documents marked "Confidential - Top Secret, June 1991" (when KF-Baathist
negotiations were still in progress) in one of the secret police stations.
These give orders to shoot "troublemakers from Shuras, Iraqi Communist
Party, and Islamic organizations, and to kill, on the spot, any soldier
who appears to have deserted or who cannot account for his gun...."
<p>On arrival in Sulaimania, we went straight to see some Shura contacts.
We were waiting for a comrade, who was to take us to one of the Shura bases.
Suddenly, he rushed into the house, grabbed his gun, cocked it, acknowledged
our presence with a hurried "Hi" and rushed out. We all followed, thinking
that fighting had started up again. Out on the street we saw a man pointing
a rifle at a group of women crouched on the ground. The comrade ran up
behind him and shouted "Drop it or I'll shoot." People started running
out of their houses, armed with pistols, and surrounded the man. He was
forced to give up his rifle - but in the scuffle a few shots were fired
and overheard by Kurdish Front Peshmerga out on patrol of the city.
<p>They got out of their jeep and asked A. to show them his license for
the rifle. Our comrade replied with derision, "You can wait all year and
I wouldn't even show you a license for a bullet." He turned to the crowd
and said: "The Kurdish Front want to take our rifles off us and hand them
back to the Baathists, just as they returned our commandeered tanks to
them." The Peshmerga were livid but they could sense the animosity of the
crowd. After a short discussion amongst themselves, they climbed back into
the jeep and drove off. Our comrade then took us to see one of the Shuras.
They told us that we had arrived at a bad time and that the length of our
stay would be determined by the danger of the ever-changing situation in
Sulaimania. They had heard that 250,000 soldiers were going to advance
on Sulaimania, so it was vital for them to constantly keep up to date with
events. They warned us that long discussions may not be possible, as they
would have to leave to assess the situation at regular intervals, especially
during the day.
<p>There were 56 Shuras in the beginning, each one set up largely according
to district. Existing Shuras would call for people to set up further ones
in their own areas. However, many of them had widely conflicting viewpoints
and so people would tend to join the Shura most closely representing their
own ideas.
<p>All leaflets and publications produced by the Shuras and other organizations
have, to a greater or lesser extent, democratic tendencies. The movement,
as far as "practical activities" are concerned, has been overridingly anti-democratic.
However, this dictatorship of the proletariat has gone largely unmentioned,
even in publications written by comrades who were amongst the most radically
active during the uprising. For example, when secret policemen were taken
prisoner by the Shuras the organizers of one Shura consulted the PUK on
how they should deal with them, as some members wanted to put them on trial,
and convict them accordingly. While they were deciding how best to organize
this, radical Shura members took matters into their own hands, breaking
into the building and killing all the secret policemen themselves.
<p>During the uprising insurgents had taken control of all government buildings
except for the main secret police station. The secret police were shelling
the city at random, killing many people, but it was clear that they could
not defend the headquarters for much longer. A major mistake was made by
the Shuras, mainly due to lack of centralization of information. The pro-nationalist
Shuras sent for the Nationalist peshmerga who were in the mountains near
Sulaimania, asking for their help in toppling the last Baathist stronghold.
These Shuras hailed the Peshmerga as heroes who had saved the day. But
the proletarian Shuras, for example Communist Perspective Organization,
had been unaware of plans to involve the Nationalists, and were furious.
<p>There is still a major problem with lack of centralization of activities
and information today. Some members of proletarian Shuras, who had not
heard about very strong anti-nationalist activities had been carried out
by other Shuras and had therefore not been able to coordinate with them.
In some parts of the city Shuras were welcoming Nationalist Peshmerga as
"our brothers," whilst in other areas, Shura people shouted "Down with
the Baath regime, Nationalism, and the Kurdish bourgeoisie!"
<p>However, the movement was generally "spontaneous" and pro-working class,
with slogans about the poor and exploited of Iraq, etc. Nationalism was
initially very weak. The things that enabled the Nationalists to hi-jack
the movement were:
<p>1. The Shuras did not have a clear political direction. For example,
instead of writing "working class" or "proletariat" in their leaflets and
slogans, they used terms such as "the people" of Kurdistan, etc. They did
not understand that "People power" - as opposed to "Proletarian power"
- is the rule of people as citizens particcipating in capitalist society.
It thus signifies the rule of money and profit, contributing to the health
of Capital.
<p>2. The Shuras did not have organized and centralized strategies during
the uprising and did not take enough precautions against the Nationalists.
For example, it did not occur to them to take over the banks and it was
only when the Nationalist Peshmergas did so that they realized their mistake.
As a result of occupying the banks, the peshmerga strengthened their position
enormously, having the means to buy and distribute food and other goods,
thus increasing people's dependence on them.
<p>3. All Shuras and organizations had democratic tendencies. Even proletarian
Shuras were demanding the right to freedom of expression, demonstrations,
publications, etc. It can be seen in all their activities that they did
not have a practical grasp of the State as a social relationship, attacking
concrete manifestations of the State in the form of Baathist party offices,
etc., but neglecting to target anti-communist movements, such as Nationalism,
as well. This represented counter-revolution within the Shura movement
itself.
<p>4. The western media and western aid agencies built up the Nationalist
movement with propaganda and practical help. The Nationalists were able
to use the local media to denounce the Shuras as "immature troublemakers
and looters."
<p>A dangerous consequence of the militants' open participation in the
uprising is that most of them are now well-known as communist militants
and, in their present defeat, are at great risk. We reminded them of the
massacre of the militants of Sanandaj in Iran in 1980. We warned them to
be very much on the defensive, if offensive action against Kurdish Front
bases is no longer possible. Because of the geography of the Sulaimania
province, winter makes it practically impossible to flee from attack. The
only way to flee Sulaimania is into the mountains, and the city itself
is surrounded by a 60 mile wide ring-road. This was built as a military
strategy for greater control of the city, in response to mass desertion
and strong militancy in the region.
<p>During discussions two main areas in which comrades in Europe could
be of help were highlighted:
<p>1. Financial. They are planning to send some comrades to live abroad,
within easy access of Iraq but where they would be able to form a point
of contact. We were very happy to hear this and agreed that we need to
support such moves toward centralizing and developing communist activity.
<p>2. Written material - they said that the political climate in Iraq is
such that the demand for proletarian publications is very high. They clearly
have a lot of practical obstacles in their way with regards to writing
leaflets, etc. and want us to send them leaflets so that they can photocopy
and distribute them. They also asked for books documenting proletarian
history that still remain banned in Iran and Iraq, their working class-oriented
reading matter being restricted to Marx and Engels.
<p>We told them that the reason we came was (besides giving financial help
and obtaining information) to make a step towards centralizing our activities,
to build a basis for continued contact, to develop communist activity through
shared experiences and to give direction to the movement. They agreed with
all of these points. In discussions, the Shuras members and us agreed on
most main points. However, on the whole, they had not thought out clear
political principles and our discussions were largely one-sided, with us
talking and them listening. They often contradicted themselves which made
things quite confusing. They explained how it had been practically impossible
to be actively organized for years, up until 6 months before the invasion.
They had had to deliberately avoid meeting up with comrades for discussion
to prevent the secret police from knowing he had contact with them. Any
gathering of more than 3 people was highly suspect in the eyes of the police.
Possession of a pot of "TIPEX" (white-out), let alone a typewriter was
punishable by hanging, if you had no license for it. Even secretaries had
to hand in their typewriters to a private police office every day after
work... It was therefore logistically very difficult to produce leaflets,
etc. However, 6 months before the invasion, the state appeared to lose
its grip and it became comparatively easy to contact comrades, etc. Discussions
were then about practical issues of how to arm themselves, how to organize
physical attacks and later, how to set up Shuras. Clearly, they have not
had much chance to develop opinions on "political theory."
<p>This is one of the reasons why they are so desperate for written material.
They kept interrupting, asking us to send them communist literature on
our return. "Before the war, which was obviously planned to crush and manipulate
the expected uprising, the working class was beginning to start and lead
activities to destabilize the State. Events, particularly because of the
war, are developing at a much faster pace than the proletariat is prepared
for," said a comrade.
<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">The main discussions</font></u></h2>
Here, in summary, are the main points of discussion.
<p>1. Since the existence of capitalism the world has consisted of two
opposing classes, and despite competition amongst themselves, all states
are united in a common interest - exploitation of the proletariat.
<p>2. Communism cannot be built in one country. The Iraqi state cannot
be abolished by armed uprising confined to Iraq. Uprisings like the one
in Iraq are products of the historical experience of the working class,
revolution being a continuous - and not isolated - process.
<p>3. We do not advocate guerilla warfare alone as a means of bringing
about communist revolution. However, we are under direct armed attack by
capitalist forces and on occasion our class needs to retaliate and if possible,
go on the offensive. Obviously, sometimes it is against the interests of
the struggle to take up arms and expose ourselves further to capitalist
attack. We are an historical class fighting the capitalist class in the
form of a social movement, not as one machine against another.
<p>4. Nationalism is a capitalist policy to crush the communist movement,
its aim being to hide the true nature of the class struggle. Neither workers
nor capitalists are national, they both belong to international opposing
classes. "Nationalist" workers have been brainwashed.
<p>We disagreed that nationalism is a planned capitalist policy. The nation
exists as a result of the capitalist mode of production. Nation and Nationalism,
the differentiation made between Black and White, Men and Women, Queer
and Straight, Arab and Kurd, etc, reflect the needs of capitalist society
and are not cynical policies. Patriotism is a real characteristic of the
bourgeoisie. In this regard, international capitalists seem to be opposing
each other, but this only constitutes the competition they need. It is
their nationalism which unites them as an international class against the
proletariat. Nationalism is not something imposed forcibly by the state
on society. It is an integral part of the capitalist social relationship
and is not confined to the ruling class. Millions of workers have died
and are still dying in defense of the Nation. We cannot say that they have
been brainwashed and are sacrificing themselves out of a robotic subjugation
to the state. Their sincere patriotism results from the capitalist social
relationship and class contradictions.
<p>They contradicted themselves many times, but still insisted that nationalism
is a planned capitalist policy rather than a movement evident in human
beings subjected to capitalist social relationships.
<p>5. A large proportion of our time was taken up with stories of events
in Sulaimania.
<p>6. Party and Class.
<p><u>Party:</u> All communist struggle and activity aiming to destroy
the capitalist way of life since its emergence represents activity by the
party of the proletariat... so that your participation in the uprising,
our journeys, etc, represent, whether we like it or not, activity by the
party, albeit only very weakly centralized. The ICG, for instance, is a
centralizing force of existing class struggle. The reason why past revolutionaries
were defeated is not because of the absence of the Party, but because of
the balance of class power between proletariat and capital.
<p><u>Class:</u> For us, being "proletarian" is not synonymous with being
a "worker." The proletariat as an international class is determined by
its struggle against capitalist society and has a deep meaning which cannot
be defined solely on the basis of income, degree of exploitation, etc.
In short, the communist movement consists of the anti-capitalist activity
of the proletariat. They agreed that, although it is an international class,
globally the proletariat is very weak and does not centralize itself internationally
as a "class" and a "party." We discussed how the power of the proletariat
in any one country is dependent on the our power throughout the world.
The same interdependence is true for capitalism - if Bush catches a cold,
Saddam sneezes.
<p>7. We had a discussion about Marxism and Marx. A comrade said he considered
Marx's work to be a product of class struggle and Marx to be a fallible
militant. We all agreed that capitalism had portrayed Marx's work as the
be-all and end-all of communist theory and Marx as the God of the working
class. Communism is a dialectical and social movement and did not start
from, nor does it stop at, Marx. It is a movement that digs a grave for
idol worship. To illustrate these points, we talked about class struggle
before Marx, e.g., the Qaramita and Mazdaq revolutions, and how individuals
and organizations existed in Marx's lifetime, who were not members of the
1st International, did not know Marx and yet had very similar programs
to him, e.g., El Productor in Cuba.
<p>8. Peace and War. They totally agreed with the statement used by the
ICG in our leaflet: "They drag us to work as they drag us to war." They
agreed that the existence of capitalism signifies war in itself, and "peace-time"
can never exist for the proletariat. However, they criticized us for saying
"Neither peace nor war," which we explained was a reaction to the very
strong peace movement in Europe, which sees war only as military conflict,
not as illnesses, accidents, isolation, work, etc.
<p>9. We strongly criticized and rejected the contents of their publications
(and some comrades totally agreed). They by no means reflect the nature
of the movement in Iraq, nor even the eyewitness accounts they related
to us. They tried to justify the weaknesses of their articles by explaining
that they wanted to write them in a language that people would understand
and that the situation appeared to demand. Our reply was that we wouldn't
be surprised to hear such excuses in Western Europe, where "social peace"
reigns and "getting the communist message to the masses" has assumed a
disproportionate degree of importance. However, to hear this in Iraq, where
the issue of the class struggle forms part of everyday conversation, was
disappointing. The bourgeoisie does not only try to crush us by the use
of prisons, massacres, torture, isolation... but also makes us feel we
have to modify the language of communism, so that "people will understand."
However, the result is to distort our history and our positions. We pointed
out all the leaflets in which they had made demands for the "the right
of free political discussion, the right to hold political meetings." Some
comrades told us that it is impossible to find an ideologically sound,
or in the communist point of view, a good leaflet produced in Sulaimania.
<p>We asked them where and when they have seen a State grant communists
"the right to destroy all States" (!), which can be the only historical
program of our movement. In many places they have written "people" instead
of "proletariat," which is not a mere word, but reflects ideology and we
pointed out the danger of this. They explained that as far as they were
concerned, "people" means proletariat and that the bourgeoisie are not
"people!!" The most striking thing is the contradiction between what they
say and what they do. In practice they are against democracy, the nation,
free rights... As we mentioned earlier, the past political climate prohibited
them from reading communist literature, active discussion, etc. Another
reason was that they underestimated the movement, thinking that the "people"
would never understand concepts such as the "proletariat."
<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">Leading up to the invasion of Kuwait</font></u></h2>
* About 8 months prior to the invasion of Kuwait, the government announced
that those entitled to welfare benefits would be allocated 250 grams oil,
250 grams sugar, 500 grams rice, 1 bar of soap, and 5 kilogram of flour
per month per person. Before, the daily wages of government employees (teachers,
bank employees, etc) were enough to buy 2 kg of rice and the daily wage
of the average worker was enough to buy 14 pieces of bread. Before the
Iran-Iraq war, monthly social security food tokens had provided far greater
amounts than this per person. Benefits had stopped during the war and this
recommencement, albeit at a much lower level, was desperately needed. However,
tokens were only distributed for 2 months and now people do not receive
any of their allowance. People, desperate for food, started selling their
TV, fridge, radio, etc. 80 kg of flour used to cost only 6 dinars, but
rose to 400 D. in the North and 800 D in the South. Most of the rotten,
rusty factories that had been closed for years were reopened. The cheapest
food, potatoes, became a meal for the rich. 1 Kuwaiti Dinar (1000 Fils)
was worth 950 Iraqi Fils in 1980, but in 1991 the Iraqi Dinar had been
so devalued that 1 Kuwaiti Dinar was worth 10 Iraqi Dinars.
<p>* Shortly before the invasion the government stopped the conscription
of farmers and their sons and announced an amnesty for many prisoners,
on the proviso that they return to and start working their land for agricultural
production.
<p>* Conscription (from the age of 17 to 45) was reinstituted as soon as
Kuwait was invaded. However, vast numbers of soldiers deserted, especially
in Sulaimania and in the Marshlands. Many of them couldn't desert, because
they didn't have any money and had been sent there without their official
papers. In general, most people, in the hope of getting rid of the Baath
regime, did not want the government to withdraw from Kuwait. (Another sign
of the hopelessness and desperation of the movement.)
<p>* At the beginning of February the Clan Army leaders in Kurdistan tried
to calm the populace, spreading rumors that a Republican Guard Unit had
been set up in Sulaimania. They warned that any popular uprising would
result in the decimation of the area in which it arose by the Republican
Guard.
<p>* On the 5th of March 1991 (just before the uprising) there was a meeting
between the Clan Army leaders and a representative of the Baath Party in
Sulaimania. The Shuras have the documents recording the minutes of this
meeting, in which the Government gave the Clan Armies free reign to kill
all those involved in any uprising.
<p>* The night before the uprising, militants (who were to go on to form
Shuras) paid a visit to the Jash (Clan Army soldiers) and asked them to
help them by giving them weapons. They were given 2 pistols and a Kalashnikov
going on to use them to attack houses belonging to the Jash and disarm
them. Some of the Jash immediately and willingly came over to fight on
their side.
<p>* One organization, Communist Perspective Organization, was set up about
6 months before the uprising. Shortly before the uprising, another one
was formed, called "Uprising Group." This was based purely on direct action
and did not publish any leaflets, etc.
<p>Communist Perspective Organization had developed their political positions
and organization before the uprising. They had coordinated their activities
with other militants and had clear political objectives. Some of them had
already been arrested for militant activity before the uprising.
<p>The militants who took weapons from the Jash had been in contact with
Communist Perspective Organization and had asked to work with them in practical
anti-State activities. Communist Perspective Organization wanted, above
all, to avoid becoming a populist organization only serving to coordinate
anti-government attacks, regardless of individual insurgents' positions.
They only wanted to work with proletarians dedicated to the same aim.
<p>* The allied bombing was in progress and the uprising had not yet started
in Sulaimania. Deserters came back to Kurdistan from the South and told
people that an uprising had started in Kut, Ammarah, Naseriyah, Samawah,
and Hellah.
<p>* On 2/29/91 deserters reported that Basra had been taken over by insurgents
and that army units, complete with weapons and tanks, had come over to
their side. There was also an insurrection in the Al-Thawra area of Baghdad.
The comrades and people we saw also assured us that the movement in the
South is far from being lead by the Shiites. In a rare moment of honesty
- and against the best interests of capitaalism - the media divulged that:
<blockquote><i>"All the damage was the result of anarchists and saboteurs...
They were anarchists, criminals. They drank whisky inside the shrines,
and made love to women..."</i>
<p>(London Independent, July 1991)</blockquote>
* On the 5th of March insurgents took control in Raniyah. Their main slogans
called for people to set up Shuras.
<p>* 3/6/91 - City of Chwar Korna joined the uprising.
<p>* 3/7/91 - Militant groups and individuals made preparations to attack
government offices and installations in Sulaimania. Some insurgents who
were unaware that militants had been planning an uprising for months and
that much of the points of attack had already been organized, tried to
inspire others to join the rebellion. They did so by spreading a rumor
that the police headquarters had been occupied by the Peshmerga, thus inadvertently
spreading very useful propaganda for the Nationalists (which was very successful!).
<p>* There were armed insurgents in every area of Sulaimania. Some had
been given weapons by Jash sympathizers, others had forced the Jash to
hand over weapons if they refused to fight with them. 2-3 hours after the
fighting started on the 7th, some insurgents "decided" to form Shuras,
which actually came about as a result of communist militant activity, past
and present, and the influence of the 1979-80 Shura movement in Iran.
<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">Particular motivating factors to form Shuras
were:</font></u></h2>
1. A need for more organization and practical direction of the movement
by militants, to prevent nationalist peshmerga appropriating the struggle
to their own cause. however, at the same time, another group of rebels
were, also in the name of Shuras, calling for the peshmerga to return to
fight in the uprising. They thought that they could follow the Leninist
idea of using the local nationalist bourgeoisie to fight "the greater evil"
of the Iraqi state. Most of these insurgents now work with the Kurdish
Front.
<p>2. A need to prevent massive looting. Opportunistic sharks were clearing
the city of, for example, hospital beds and electrical equipment and taking
them to Iran to sell. As hospitals came under the control of the insurgents
and increasing numbers of rebels were wounded, such items became vital
to the struggle.
<p>3. They saw a need to organize militant action - where their main targets
should be and how they should attack them. For example, 48 conscript soldiers
were picked up and then hidden by one of the Shuras, to protect them from
indiscriminate killing by the Nationalists. They were later released in
a safer area. They also aimed to develop their activity and spread it to
other parts.
<p>* The same day nearly 30,000 people, some armed and some not, converged
on the Shura headquarters at Awat School, where Shura members talked to
the crowds through loudspeakers. "These are our headquarters, a base for
councils of the exploited. Set up your workers' councils. Make the Shura
your base for long-term struggle. Bring looted goods and food here and
we will distribute them. Class consciousness is the arm of freedom. Revolutionary
people, revolutionary exploited, the achievements of the revolution have
cost us our own blood! Keep it going! Don't waste it!"
<p>Shura supporters captured six hundred secret policemen and brought them
to the headquarters. Some Shura members went to consult PUK leaders in
the mountains regarding the 600 prisoners. Noshirwan, a military commander,
said that they should not be killed: "they could be useful later." The
Shura members themselves wanted to parade the policemen, listing their
catalogues of torture in front of the crowds before killing them. However,
the crowds were livid at Noshirwan's suggestion and even prevented the
Shura from parading the men, pouring into the building and killing them
all themselves.
<p>* By the time the city came under control, there were 56 Shuras in existence,
including the Refuse Collectors, Cement, Cloth, Cigarette, and Sugar factory
workers' Shuras.
<p>* Communist Perspective's Shura (CPS), which included some of their
members and many sympathizers, were in close contact with the above 5 workers'
Shuras. They held meetings in which they discussed how the workers had
taken over the factories, killing Baathist managers and employees, etc.
Communist Perspective Shura stressed that factory machines should be protected
and not destroyed in the heat of the uprising. They anticipated a time
when the uprising would be cut off from any external supplies and would
have to support itself for food, clothes, etc.
<p>* 3/10/91 - Shuras were set up in Arbil and took control of the city
in 3 hours; there were 42 Shuras.
<p>* 3/12/91 - Shura's representatives from Sulaimania went to Arbil and
held meetings regarding the centralization of work. The Awat Shura told
all the other Shuras that a central committee should be formed. This was
set up and they started to produce Shura membership cards, to be able to
identify those attending their meetings and armed Shura militants. However,
there was some conflict and unity broke down as a result of three different
viewpoints:
<p>1. Members of the central committee must be politically pro-working
class.
<br>2. The Shuras represent "the people" and anyone should be allowed to
sit on the central committee, not only communist militants.
<br>3. The members should be democratically elected and anyone opposed
to the Baath regime should be allowed to vote.
<p>* The peshmerga arrived in the city shortly before it came under the
complete control of the insurgents. They occupied all the commandeered
government vehicles, the bank, and took over government properties, thus
influencing people to concentrate on looting rather than the struggle.
<p>* 3/16/91 - The anniversary of the Halabja Massacre. A memorial was
organized by the Shuras, Kurdish Front, religious parties, Iraqi Communist
Party, RF, and some small leftist groups. There were more than 10,000 Shura
sympathizers, and the first speeches were made by various Shura groups.
The CPS spoke about working class struggles in Turkey, Brazil, etc, how
the proletariat and communism are against all nationalist movements, and
the conflict in Kurdistan is the same as all others, between labor and
capital, bourgeoisie and proletariat. The main slogans used were:
<blockquote><font face="Comic Sans MS">"Bread, Work, Freedom"</font>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">"Bombs, tanks, planes will not chase us
from this city."</font>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">"Only workers can bring about a different
life."</font></blockquote>
The Kurdish Front, nationalist Shuras and the religious people shouted
them down, mocking and ridiculing their political positions.
<p>* 3/17/91 - The Kurdish Front had not been paid the respect they felt
they deserved at the memorial day and realized that the Shuras had widespread
mass support. They started to broadcast lies on the radio about the Shuras,
saying that many of them were ex-Baathists, looters, troublemakers and
emphasizing how the Shuras despise religion, in an attempt to alienate
any Muslims from supporting them. They tried to spread rumors that the
Shuras had collapsed because of their inability to lead the people and
run the city and they announced the establishment of a Kurdish Peace Force.
<p>* 3/18/91 - On hearing this, the Shuras arranged a meeting and decided
to send 5 representatives to see the Kurdish Front, to discuss the rumors
and solve the problem. However, many Shuras did not agree with this and
organized demonstrations, using loudspeakers denouncing the reactionary
and dangerous policies of the Kurdish Front.
<p>CPS made it clear that they are not only against the Kurdish Front,
but also against the Kurdish Nation and, along with the members of Hasta
and Militant Front (Shura), disrupted the meeting...
<p>This dispute clarified the positions of various Shuras and their individual
members and they divided into three main factions:
<p>1. Communist Perspective Shura
<br>2. Radical Leftist Organizations
<br>3. PUK and KDP, or Kurdish Front
<p>* 3/18/91 - Fighting began in Kirkuk. CPS and Leftist Shuras went to
support the struggle. Many peshmerga went and returned with looted expensive
cars, etc.
<p>* 3/20/91 - Kirkuk was taken over and six Shuras were set up.
<p>At this time the radio reported that Jalal Talabani was in Sulaimania
and called for all inhabitants to go to the Peshmerga headquarters to hear
"what good news he has to give you." The only people that went were their
supporters and when they realized that support for the Shuras had increased
and spread to other cities, they started rumors that government and Mujahadeen
Khalq army units had arrived in Chamchamal. They frightened people into
leaving en masse; first, because there was a great fear of the Mujahadeen
Khalq and secondly, because they heard that that evening Jalal Talabani
had been at Sheikh Salari Havids' house and had told him to advise all
peshmerga families to leave as soon as possible. That same day the peshmerga
and their families left the city and told people "The Army is coming.."
as they went. Thirdly, the Shuras' propaganda against the Kurdish Front
and the Nationalists had been grossly inadequate and insufficient to convince
people of the Kurdish Front's lies and quell their fear, particularly in
the light of past massacres.
<p>On the same day the Shuras organized a demo, telling people through
loudspeakers, "We will stay and fight... those who are leaving are cowards
and the gravediggers of this city..."
<p>70% of the city left. 5000 soldiers and 60 tanks arrived the following
day. Sulaimania was taken over after a fight, but there were no subsequent
"gratuitous" killings carried out by the Peshmerga against the population.
However, in Kirkuk and Chamchamal, revenge was wreaked on insurgents, including
old people, children and even hospital in-patients...
<p>* The cities of Kirkuk, Sulaimania, Chamchamal, etc, were recaptured
soon. This was done mainly by the Iraqi Communist Party, CPS, and other
Shura militants. Tanks and military vans were burned down. Nevertheless,
the end result was the same, as the State (Kurdish Front, Nationalists)
returned and took over remaining property, "to keep it in a safer place,"
i.e., to give it back to the government. Some Shura members got "very angry"
(in an entirely ineffectual way) and argued with the Kurdish Front, telling
them that issues of life and death were at stake and should not be played
like a game of chess.
<p>* 5 days after the start of the uprising in Sulaimania, Shuras were
holding daily meetings in Amin Zaki Bak School, attended by about 1000
people. Representatives from all the different Shuras came and raised various
points for discussion. There were many arguments and some representatives
stormed out of the assembly. The main points put forward were:
<p>1. The need for solidarity with Shuras in the South.
<br>2. Religion should be separated from the State.
<br>3. The need for political freedom (Democracy).
<br>4. Rule by the Shuras or by Parliamentary Democracy?
<br>5. Self-determination for the Kurdish nation.
<br>6. Equal rights for men and women.
<br>7. The Allied Forces must pull out.
<br>8. Class struggle or Nationalist struggle?
<p>* 3/21/91 - one of the Shuras was keeping 9 secret policemen hostage
but killed them without consulting the Kurdish Front.
<p>* 3/23/91 - The Shura in Kirkuk took over the radio station and broadcast
to the city. They also distributed all the food they had found in government
supermarkets, and divided the houses of secret policemen up amongst the
homeless.
<p>* During the second uprising in Kirkuk, the insurgents went to take
over the oil and gasoline plants outside the city. We were told that there
was a battle lasting about 2 hours around one factory. The insurgents were
being shot at as they approached, but they outnumbered the factory's defenders.
After a while, the shooting stopped and people were surprised to see nationalist
Peshmerga coming out of the building, signalling for the people to hold
their fire, which they did. The Peshmerga explained that the factories
must not be looted as they are needed by the Kurdish state. (There you
have it!)
<p>* 4/3/91 - A demonstration was organized by CPS, SWE and proletarian
Shuras. They counteracted rumors spread by scaremongers about the imminently
advancing Iraqi forces and the collapse of the Basra uprising, attempting
to curb the tide of people fleeing Sulaimania. Slogans used were "We will
stay and fight!," information was broadcast about the strength of the Shuras,
not only in Sulaimania, but throughout Iraq and people were encouraged
to stay and support the movement.
<p>That afternoon fighting started up again in Sulaimania. The army only
held out against the rebels for a very short time, being rapidly disarmed
following a fierce attack. Yet again, the Kurdish Front returned captured
heavy artillery to the army.
<p>* 6/29/91 - At the same time as the Nationalists were holding demonstrations
in Duhok and Panjwin against the withdrawal of the Allied presence in Kurdistan
(in contrast to Shura-led demos demanding that they get out) offices, shops,
and police stations continued to be attacked in Arbil, Sulaimania, and
Dehok, the insurgents commandeering further food and weapons whilst under
fire by the Peshmerga. Similar struggles were also taking place in the
Al-Thawra district of Baghdad.
<p>* July '91 - the Iraqi Communist Party Peshmerga, Shuras and other radical
leftist group members went to Kalar (a town on the main route to Sulaimania)
as they had received information that the Mujahadeen Khalq, who had massacred
the whole population of the town of Tchiman shortly before, was advancing
on Sulaimania. Kalar is very small and is split down the center by a dual
carriageway. The insurgents hid themselves on the roofs of the houses and
told everybody to be quiet until the unit entered the town. But when a
woman saw that the soldiers were dressed in Kurdish clothes and had hung
a portrait of Jalal Talabani on the tanks, she happily (stupidly) rushed
out towards them. They then realized that the houses were inhabited and
turned the tank guns on them and fired, first aiming at and killing the
woman... the insurgents then started shooting, managing to blow up the
tanks and kill all the Mujahadeen. Some of them didn't believe that they
were Mujahadeen until they searched the bodies and found their papers.
<p>* 7/13/91 - Food Aid had been given to the Kurdish Front to distribute
to the "needy." Naturally, the Peshmerga had shared it out amongst their
closest friends and were living well while the poor waited, for over a
month, for food and medical supplies.
<p>By the 13th people could not be fobbed off any longer... They attacked
the Kurdish Front headquarters in Zakho, injured and disarmed many Peshmerga
and distributed the food supplies, going on to burn down the headquarters
and the food warehouses. Some of the Peshmerga fled to Raniyah to get help
and on their return searched houses for suspected "ringleaders," imprisoning
them, making them pay fines, and releasing them after shaving their heads
as an extra humiliating touch.
<p>* 7/17/91 - There was a violent demo in Arbil which the Peshmerga again
tried to bring under control, extolling the virtues of peaceful demonstration,
suggesting people wait for the outcome of negotiations with the government.
However, they were ignored and the Shura led attacks on government buildings
under a slogan "Bread, Work, Freedom."
<p>* 7/18/91 - Some of the Shuras held a meeting in Sulaimania and decided
to support the struggle in Arbil by carrying out similar activities. They
tried to keep their plans secret but Kurdish Front spies had infiltrated
the Shuras, and knew that continued uprisings were inevitable but were
determined to avoid a repeat of Arbil, where the movement left them behind.
They thought of ways in which the struggle could be given the direction
they desired:
<p>1. By preventing the Shuras from organizing themselves.
<br>2. By manipulating the movement into a purely violent struggle (guerrilla
warfare, guns against guns, instead of class against class) a very successful
policy, diverting people's attention from the true nature of the struggle.
<br>3. By broadcasting propaganda denying that they had supported the Iraqi
Army, preventing looting and aided police in Arbil thus denouncing Shura
members as liars, as they had published accounts of such Peshmerga action
in Arbil.
<p>The Peshmerga changed tack, shooting soldiers and burning their vehicles,
but soon realized that they had nowhere near as much support as the Shuras,
whose influence was increasing daily. They tried yet another tactic, calling
for a stop to the bloodshed, parading the streets as if on a victory march
and then announced "The agreement has been signed. We have autonomy for
Kurdistan, democracy for Iraq!"
<p>* 7/20/91 - CPS, SWC and other leftist organizations organized another
demo in Sulaimania. Their principal banner was again "Bread, Work, Freedom."
Shura members heard that Barzani had given the Kurdish secret police permission
to infiltrate the demos. The demo remained a peaceful march through the
city, with the Shura members taking a back seat, only talking quietly to
individuals, denouncing the Kurdish Front as the enemy, calling for formation
of anti-nationalist Shuras, but this time from the sidelines only. The
Shuras made the mistake of underestimating the degree of mass support for
them, largely as a result of insufficient contact with Shura militants
in central and southern Iraq. The Kurdish Front attacked them during the
demo, destroying their banners, beating them up and imprisoning some of
them. The Shura missed their chance of rallying massive public aggression
against the Kurdish Front, which could have been sparked by a few militants
turning their weapons on the Peshmerga. Instead the Shura members turned
and ran - and they still cannot find words strong enough to express their
regret for such a gross error.
<p>* In the beginning of September Communist Perspective Organization received
a letter purportedly from the Shuras, asking to arrange a meeting with
them in Halabja. On the day of the meeting, CPO members were waiting in
their headquarters for them. However, when a comrade saw approximately
400 armed Peshmerga advancing toward the area, the comrades realized they
had been set up. They positioned themselves on the roof to defend themselves
and many Shura and CPO sympathizers joined them.
<p>The PUK had intended to disarm them and had written the bogus letter
in order to be sure that active CPO members would be in the building at
the time... The Peshmerga realized that they were ready to retaliate and
told them that they just wanted to talk, but CPO replied that there can
be no point of common discussion between them and the Peshmerga. When the
Peshmerga realized that the crowd were on the CPO's side, they turned back,
telling people that nobody can to them, they are very aggressive...

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">On the contrary, they must show that they

In this process socialist proletarians, radical factions, and the avant-guards
of the movement have the practical task of assuring the formation, propaganda
and organization of proletarians within a different framework. We have
to confront the miserable conditions of life, the economic blockade...

capitalist policies to destroy revolutionary forces.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">There is no doubt about the fact that current

proletarians to "mount the world stage" and become truly active, representing
the needs of their struggle... Only as a centralized and united movement
will the proletariat be able to confront the bourgeoisie and get their

cigarette, electricity, clothes and municipal workers including "Tahir"
and "Hmurabi" factory workers formed shuras at "Nassir" camp. Chicken farmers
and the unemployed in Sulaimania set up a joint shura with petrol workers

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">The main point of discussion during the first

thrilled to take part, elected representatives in free and direct voting.

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">These meetings showed workers what strength

watching them. From time to time, from every corner, workers would stand

They gave accounts of barbaric and inhuman behavior and the unbearable
life of workers. Following on from previous world-wide historical experience,
the bell of liberty, equality, and workers' government rang throughout

The situation of the Shura members is now fairly precarious. They have
to keep up to date, hour by hour, on the activities of the Nationalists
and the Baathist Army. The Shuras now have information networks from city
to city, which largely involve individuals travelling at short notice around
the area. They are worried that the Kurdish Front might secretly allow
army divisions into Sulaimania or that they may have inside information
about the movements of government troops.
<p>A few members of the Shuras know from experiences in the Sandaj revolution
that when the Nationalists scatter and desert a city without warning the
inhabitants, a massacre is imminent. They are therefore on the lookout
for mass movements of Kurdish Front forces.
<p>One day a man in Kurdish clothes was shot dead, who was known to be
a secret policeman. The documents he had on him showed that he had permission
from Masoud Barzani to pose as a peshmerga. It is unclear who killed him,
but it was definitely not the Nationalists.
<p>On our way back, one of the interesting things we were told was that
the agreement between the Baathists and the Kurdish Front was signed ages
ago. It was kept secret because the issues of "compromise" and "autonomy"
have become a farce and the PUK and KDP are aware of the mass support for
the Shura movement. Proletarians are fed up with compromises and want to
continue the fight instead.

<u><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+2>1. Introduction</font></font></u></h2>
In this text we are going to try to draw the lessons of the struggles that
broke out in Burma in the spring of '88. First of all we would like to
underline one or two points to place these events in their local and international
context.
<p>Considering, from a worldwide point of view, the past ten years, we
can assert without much risk of making mistakes that there have been social
tensions, confrontations, struggles, which confirm, if there has ever been
any need to do so, that even in periods of profound social peace the proletariat
is never crushed totally, that it never disappears completely from the
scene of history. Of course, taking a closer look, we notice at once that
those explosions of anger are weak, that the demands are confused, etc.
The same weaknesses can be found in almost every struggle wherever it breaks
out and the events in Burma are not exceptions to the characteristics of
today's struggles, which are sporadic, rarely concomitant in different
countries, and occur within sectorial, national or other sorts of frontiers.
The reader will find in our reviews different attempts to understand, analyze
and draw lessons of the struggles of our class: hunger riots in Morocco
in 1984 and in Tunisia in 1986, the conflicts in Poland, in Gaza and the
West Bank, in England during the miners' strike, in the Iran-Iraq war,
in Algeria and in Argentina,...
<p>As to the struggle of the proletariat in Burma, we want to underline
some quite important qualitative differences in comparison with other struggles
close in time. They are of relative importance of course. Their importance
only exists in relation with the context of social peace, the context of
our class anaesthesia.
<p>First, the struggle in Burma can be distinguished by its duration: it
lasted at least seven months. Then by its massiveness; indeed, even if
we know very well that never during its history has the proletariat been
defeated by the lack of numbers (the lack is rather qualitative than quantitative),
it's to be underlined that there were not just one or two sectors, one
or two factories in the foreground, even though that's how the movement
had started - like anywhere else. In Burma, all what the bourgeois press
calls "the population", "the people", very quickly committed themselves
in the struggle: some helped insurgents to hide, giving them shelter and
food; others demonstrated in the streets or looted the shops, attacking
all symbols of wealth, others, like the soldiers for instance, refused
to shoot or even deserted. Many proletarians joined the general strikes
and entire cities were paralysed.
<p>Finally, the third important point of this struggle is the organization
of the insurgents. We know that entire cities and ports were emptied of
their administration and ruled by the insurgents for a while. We know that
the targets of the looting were not chosen by chance and that facing the
bourgeois terror a proletarian counter-terror was organized: self-defence
groups were set up, police headquarters looted, the defence of large areas
of the suburb of Rangoon assumed. We think we may affirm that for the past
few years there have been many attempts to lead the struggles a proletarian
way.
<p>But, unfortunately, in this case even more than in that of the struggles
in Iran and Iraq we depend on the information given by the bourgeois press.
Therefore we have tried to gather as much information as possible from
the largest number of newspapers available. We consulted the press of a
lot of countries from China to France, from Cuba to Italy. But no information
is reliable and the result is not the same as it would be if we could have
gone there or received news from militants.
<p>From October '88, the news items got rarer and fewer, so meagre, so
poor that we don't really know what has been going on there since about
December '88.
<p>However, this doesn't mean that the bourgeois order has been restored
or that the proletarian movement has been crushed. Experience taught us
that the death of a struggle movement is generally proclaimed, shouted
out and praised by the bourgeoisie as the victory of democracy over this
or that dictatorship, as the triumph of a national liberation movement
over a government paid by this power or that bloc. The withdrawal of the
troops, the creation of a new independent State, the promises of elections
very soon, the recognition of the opposition,... usually mark the defeat
of the movement, the end of the struggle. We haven't heard anything like
this about Burma. We haven't seen any clear signs of the political publicity
generally mobilized by the bourgeois to mark their victory against the
proletarians, the crushing of a proletarian struggle.
<p>The bourgeois black out, the very fact that the subject of "Burma" almost
completely disappeared from the pages of newspapers, have proved again
that the bourgeoisie wants to divert the attention of all those who might
have a feeling of community with this struggle. According to the bourgeoisie,
of course, the proletarians in Burma set a very bad example to their brothers
all over the world. The bourgeois world State does everything to repress
the movement in the Burma itself by supporting the Burmese bourgeois on
the one hand, and to smother its example, preventing its spreading outside,
thanks to the powerful media. But the silence the bourgeoisie tries to
impose does not mean that the bourgeois order has been restored in Burma.
The social situation and the hatred for the State make the equilibrium
the bourgeoisie tries to impose by terror extremely precarious. To live,
the proletarians are forced to negate the laws and to confront the bourgeoisie.
From this and the past waves of struggles the proletarians in Burma have
drawn lessons which will make it possible for them to be in the vanguard
of the world proletariat in this region for the big fights to come.
<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+2>2. The historical context of
the social explosion</font></font></u></h2>
26 years of General Ne Win's leadership at the head of the BSPP (Burmese
Socialist Program Party) only resulted in accelerating and catastrophically
deepening the ruinous effects of the capitalist world crisis. Burma, considered
in the fifties as one of the biggest rice producers and exporters, has
now become one of the "poorest" countries of the planet. The living conditions
of the proletarians have extremely rapidly deteriorated. The annual per
capita income has tumbled from $ 690 in 1960 to $ 190 in 1988, which is
lower than that in China.
<p>However, in this region, Burma is a little different from the other
countries. In the beginning of the fifties, the bourgeoisie applied there
a stalinist social democratic "anti-imperialist" policy with nationalizations
and one-party system (the BSPP). The leader, U Nu, put forward a policy
of virulent nationalism. He had fought against the British in the colonial
times. U Nu tried to arrive at a synthesis between "marxism" and buddhism.
He was the first translator of Marx into Burmese. His faction represented
an anti-imperialist-social-democratic-buddhist line, which means, in practice,
the reinforcing of the "Independent National State" and the crushing of
the proletariat in the name of nation and democracy (a well-known method
from the Philippines to Nicaragua, from Europe to China). U Nu, overthrown
by General Ne Win in 1962, went into exile and later came back to take
the lead of the "democratic opposition".
<p>The proletarians' economic situation has become catastrophic during
the past years: the average wage was worth one cup of tea daily for each
member of a family of 3 members, in 1988. The black market is the only
way to survive. In September '87, the government removed 70% of the banknotes
without warning or compensation.
<p>Even so, the proletarians in Burma do not live in conditions as miserable
and extreme as our brothers of Bangladesh and India do. The rapid concentration
of capital, and of exploitation determined in Burma the development of
the proletariat and of its struggles, even though the latter were controlled
and repressed by a national union of the stalinist kind. Due to this "development",
on the one hand, there is an "educated" proletariat, "organized into trade
unions", but on the other hand, the traditions of struggle are much stronger
than in the neighbouring countries.
<p>In Burma, religion is not of much importance, but it is interesting
and characteristic that there, the same way as in Russia (where the Orthodox
Russian Church coexisted with the one-party government and took an active
part in the military mobilization of proletarians for the 1939-45 war),
the Stalinist faction of the bourgeoisie has maintained a considerable
number of Buddhist priests, even though their ideological influence on
the proletariat has been insignificant (this isn't true for India, for
instance). The religious institutions have served as a kind of security
reserve for the bourgeoisie and during the last period of the uprising,
Buddhist monks would do the job for which they have been kept in reserve:
pacifying the movement, imposing the banner of non-violence and democracy,
fighting (sometimes physically) the violent manifestations of the need
of the proletariat.
<p>The past three decades have seen the slowly increasing militancy of
the proletariat (violently expressed in the '70s) determined by the deterioration
of the living conditions. To face this, the bourgeoisie had to develop
a lovely range of different and competitive bourgeois factions to channel
the revolt, to enrol the proletarian fights in fights which are absolutely
alien from the causes of their revolt, from their needs. Until 1988, the
most efficient factions were the guerilla movements, the pro-Chinese, pro-Indian,
pro-British, pro-Russian,... nationalist groups (1).
<p>That assortment proved to be enough during more than twenty years to
enrol the discontent proletarians and to kill them slowly in fights between
the various armed groups and in the army of the State. But inside the army
a growing discontent was developing because of the deterioration of the
living conditions there also, the weariness, the lassitude of the endless
combats. The relative equilibrium expressed by a relative social peace,
with continuous combats in the mountains and along the borders on the one
hand, and, the violent imposition of work in most areas, and first of all
in the big cities, on the other hand, thus, this relative equilibrium worked
thanks to (and in) a context of relative economic stability.
<p>But, since the deepening of the world economic crisis in the seventies,
problems began to accumulate: the world market prices moved violently up
and down, the competition between various groups of capitalists sharpened
and the exploitation increased. In Burma, the ruling faction was in a dilemma
as to how to adapt to the changing international conditions while facing
the real menace of working class uprisings. This phenomenon became more
and more acute, because, facing the development of the wrath of the working
class, the bourgeoisie had already been forced to put forward its radical
faction. But if Stalinist reformism (considered erroneously as a "violation
of general norms of capitalism") is necessary to fight against the working
class; on the other hand, Stalinism as a ruling bourgeois faction is a
trump the bourgeoisie burns, making it useless for the future. So the hands
of the Stalinist governments are more or less tied when they have to consider
(because of the local concretizations of the world crisis) the possibility
of reforms. They have to shake the status quo in which they feel at ease
to avoid the weakening of their country in the international competition.
But they know by experience that shaking the form of their extremely static
government might cause even more trouble because the proletarians might
see a breach and rush into it.
<p>The bourgeoisie won't forget the "destalinisation" in Russia which resulted
in "outflankings" it would rather have done without. "Conservative" forces
following the letter of the stalinist dogma refuse any kind of reforms,
because their fear of the proletariat is greater than the weight of the
necessity to make the country competitive in the world market (cf. Ceausescu,
Brezhnev,...); the "reformists" rather choose a general reform of the economic
- and, accordingly, political - structuress, they incline to favour "a sort
of westernization" (cf. Yeltsin,...). Eventually, the "pragmatic" faction
overcomes (cf. Gorbachev, Ne Win,...) undertaking half-hearted reforms
and trying to conserve the essence of the old version of bourgeois government.
<p>Of course, it is not a question of choosing a "better" or a "worse"
solution, it is a question of emergency in the context of the deepening
world crisis of capitalism. One expression of this is the pendular movement,
the oscillation movement swinging to "the right" then to "the left"; pendulum
movement between taking reform measures and their withdrawal, one step
towards the "westernization of the economic politics", then another step
towards the reinforcement of central control; measures to change the political
structures, then (in the form of "counter-reforms" or sometimes of a "military
coup") measures to consolidate the old structures.
<p>In the seventies, this swinging movement was characteristic to Burma:
political opening, loans on the international financial market, encouraging
people to learn English,... and then, isolationist moves with increasing
efforts to pay the debt back, increasing central control in the political
life, a ban on the English courses at the schools,... But all this couldn't
stop the local effects of the world crisis of Capital and the worsening
of the social situation. The bourgeoisie, no matter what their ideology
is, necessarily MUST diminish the social wage, increase the exploitation,
deteriorate the working conditions, directly or indirectly (shortages)
raise the prices, reinforce state terror making reference to the interests
of the "true" (parliamentarist) democracy (reforms), or to those of the
"people's democracy" (called "dictatorship of the proletariat" by stalinists).
<p>We mustn't forget that the situation had already been tense in Burma
since the fifties which implied, even before the deepening of the world
crisis, a local militarization of the State administrative apparatus and
the economy.
<p>From the bourgeois point of view, the worsening of the social situation
meant the accumulation of problems with the industrial and agricultural
production (in '87 they decreased drastically and the exports went down
to a minimum level mainly because of internal tensions), the weight of
the debt,... The fragile stability was disappearing with the price-rises,
the increase of the pressure of capital on the working class; the situation
of the latter became unbearable. For the proletariat, life was getting
more and more expensive every day and the wages were insufficient to feed
the families, which compelled the workers to work ever more to buy rice.
<p>An example: the daily wage of a worker amounted to 10 kyats in 1988
(officially, in August '88, one dollar was worth 6 or 7 kyats while on
the black market the exchange rate was 40 kyats for one dollar). In 1988
the price of the rice increased by 400%, we can imagine the situation of
the proletarians whose average wage was 10 kyats while it cost 50 to feed
one family!
<p>What's more, the commerce totally aligned itself to the black market
prices, that is to say goods were sold at a price six times higher than
the regular ("official") price. For the proletarians it became impossible
to avoid the deepening of poverty, even trying some funny business, working
overtime,... weren't enough any more.
<p>From the point of view of the capitalist order, the everlasting solution
to escape the crisis is the massive destruction of commodities (mainly
the proletarians, because they are the most dangerous ones). This destruction
will then make it possible, just like a good breath of fresh air, to re-invest,
re-build, give work... Therefore, this capitalist order has to massacre
the proletarians: "peacefully" starving them to death, if possible, or
by killing them more rapidly and efficiently in internal or international
wars.
<p>In Burma, the decrease of wages went thus under the minimum level of
daily existence, and this situation, permanent in Bangladesh or in India,
provoked here a real shock. The difference between "life" in 1988 and twenty
years before was all the less bearable since all the expectations that
the situation would take a change for the better had gradually vanished.
On the other hand, the situation of the soldiers (proletarians in uniform)
followed the same pattern: problems of food, permanent wars against the
autonomists, families ruined by the crisis and on the verge of starvation,
etc. These elements led to desertion and refusal to shoot at demonstrators.
<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+2>3. The Struggles</font></font></u></h2>
In February and March '87, more than 200 officers of Rangoon (capital of
Burma) and Mandalay (the second largest town) were arrested for having
criticized, during a religious service held for the soldiers, Ne Win's
economical policy of the "empty iron rice bowl" (ironical diversion of
the declarations and goals of General Ne Win who claimed he would give
a rice bowl to every citizen). Then, in March '88, riots broke out after
the police murdered a student during the repression of a demonstration.
Confrontations lasted more than a week and the initial reasons of the rioters
changed into a refusal of the government decision to take out of circulation
all the banknotes of more than 15 kyats ("to fight against black market"
- the same measure with the same argument  was taken in Russia by the Gorbatchev
administration, in 1991). The real aim of this step was to diminish even
more drastically the "buying power" of the proletarians in Burma.A massive
revolt followed: rioters set shops on fire and attacked those they considered
rich, taking their possessions away.
<p>In May and June '88: further strikes and demonstrations, further looting.
General Ne Win imposed the martial law and the curfew. As it often happens,
the social movement in Burma started from the "student" sector, which isn't
surprising, considering how faint their hopes were to get a job and how
dark the future they had to confront was - "they": the proletarians not
yet unleashed in the employment arena. But the worsening of the economical
situation rapidly made thousands of people go down to the streets and support
the young "student" proletarians. General Ne Win mobilized the elite troops
in the capital to crush the movement.
<p>During the summer, the number of rioters increased. In August '88 some
reports spoke about millions of demonstrators. Several police quarters
were looted. "Protesters seize guns", China Daily wrote on 11th August,
"A number of police stations are in the hands of the demonstrators and
they have seized the weapons from the police". The Burmese bourgeois reacted
with the well-known mixture of promises and repression. The government
promised to introduce reforms in the economy, and, as it always happens
in countries ruled by a Stalinist government, stressed the "westernization",
which "will bring welfare to the people". At the same time, the police
and the army fired at the crowd and killed several demonstrators.
<p>Since July proletarians had gone to the offensive: more and more often
in Rangoon, but also in other big towns like Mandalay, rioters undertook
an active fight against the state and the private property. They fought
with iron clubs and sharpened bicycle spokes, with knives and swords, machetes,...
they beheaded militaries, attacked the villas of government officials,
etc.
<p>In the port of Rangoon the workers refused to unload the freighters.
Those carrying food were looted. The insurrectional pressure was so strong
that General Ne Win resigned on 23rd July. General Sein Lwin, called "the
butcher of Rangoon" for his role in the bloody repression of the March
demonstrations, took his place. It was him who gave his soldiers the following
order: "Hit to kill, shoot to kill". General Sein Lwin pledged a total
reform of the economy and the introduction of a multiparty system in Burma.
"General Sein Lwin's reputation for brutality has been balanced (sic) in
recent weeks with a rare show of pragmatism in promoting reforms" - The
Guardian, August 11.
<p>Although the press tried to underestimate the insurrectional elements
of the demonstrations (and will always do so), stressing (as it always
does) the democratical aspects of the struggles, the latter reached, at
the end of August, such a violence that the press just didn't talk about
it any more. Only a few lines filter here and there, as for instance the
burning of the houses of 36 ministers and deputies by angry demonstrators.
<p>August was a month of continuous riots. The proletariat took the power
in several towns. In the port of Kowsong, the inhabitants assaulted the
office buildings and threatened to set them on fire. They expelled the
employees and the police. In Pegu, a lot of soldiers joined the insurgents
and together they prevented the arrival of military reinforcement coming
from the capital. In Prome, some soldiers refused to shoot at the crowd.
In Toungoo, an officer is said to have been killed by his soldiers who
also refused to shoot at demonstrators. In Rangoon, different units of
the army shot at each other, which shows the social confrontation existing
within the army; all the accesses to the city were closed to prevent the
inhabitants of other cities from going to help the insurgents of the capital.
The buddhist clergy interceded and implored the government to give the
proletarians some concessions in order to be able to impose law and order
again. On 10th August, an incident quite revealing of the depth and the
extent of the social confrontation, an airplane was dropping leaflets on
Rangoon threatening to bomb the city if the people kept on resisting the
army. On 14th, a diplomat holding a post in Rangoon said: "Hunger is the
engine of the uprising, democracy comes after"; and the French newspaper
"Lib&eacute;ration" wrote on 30th: "Burma is drifting (off), the insurrection
has spread all over the country and is on the capital doorstep..." It is
quite significant that the government accused (and therefore recognized
the existence of) "a network of clandestine organisation that feeds and
coordinates the movement". "The present instability is due to the organization
and the intervention of these trouble-makers", it said. Liberation on 14th
August added: "The movement is structured into closed cells, gathering
a few individuals knowing each other very well and trusting each other".
Contacts were made with old militants who had participated in the movements
of '70 in Burma and '73 in Thailand (those movements directly belonging
to the worldwide wave of struggles of 1967-1973). The press talked about
at least 6 clandestine groups acting together, and about 30 secret leaders
acting through the student union created on 17th March and banned by the
authorities without any delay. The bourgeoisie might spectacularly stress
the aspects of organization and leadership of the struggle, which does
not always exist, to frighten the citizens, nevertheless this kind of campaign
there was based on real aspects of organization and leadership of our class.
<p>During August, thousands of demonstrators were massacred by the army.
Reports speak of 3,000 deaths in only one week. General Sein Lwin, unable
to calm down the confrontations in spite of the promises and massacres,
resigned on 12th, giving his place to Maung Maung, a lawyer. The bourgeoisie
tried to calm down the situation, placing a puppet at the head of the government.
Straight away the latter demanded peace and tranquillity, a sine qua non
for the recovery of the economy. He suppressed the martial law to show
his will of pacification (but of course the army kept on shooting at demonstrators).
Maung Maung's fight against the proletariat was supported by part of the
"democratic opposition", like General Aung Gyu, a reformist military leader,
who had accused the former governments of corruption and had been arrested
in July for having "attacked the state". Confident in the "good image"
his past of "an oppressed of the regime" gave him, this general stood for
non-violence on both sides "to avoid anarchy and more bloodshed", as he
said. Maung Maung introduced an amnesty for some prisoners, most of whom
(but it was kept secret) were members of the bourgeois factions jailed
by the military regime: democrats, nationalists, liberals,... Many thousands
of proletarians remained in jail, which later led to one of the biggest
massacres in Burma.
<p>It is important to stress that the common efforts of the government
(promises of reforms, amnesties and police terror) and of the opposition
(discourses on anarchy, participation in the demonstrations to impose non-violence
and the respect for property) didn't manage, at this stage, to pacify,
calm down or crush the movement of resistance, which was threatening to
escalate into a general insurrection.
<p>The opposition supported the government and cooperated with the army,
while always stressing the importance of "pacific protests against dictatorship"
and of the necessity of avoiding chaos. Monks also participated in the
struggle against subversion, calling the army units to defend a factory
attacked by "a gang of more than 500 criminals", then they organized an
"alternative system" of self-management, shouting loud and clear their
submission to the rioters interests! Another figure of the opposition came
into the limelight: Daw Aung San Suu Kyi (nicknamed by the media "the Burmese
Cory Aquino"), the daughter of a Burmese independence leader, Aung San
killed by a bourgeois rival faction in 1947. With this aura of prestige,
she fought for democracy and multiparty system, with the clear conscience
of the bourgeois humanists, exterminators of the working class in struggle.
<p>By the end of August, the proletarians' movement gained importance in
the army as well as in other capitalist institutions. Defections from the
army became massive, soldiers turned their arms against their officers.
At the same time, there were proletarian revolts in several prisons of
the country. Some escaped and many prisoners were massacred. 13kms from
the capital, in the prison of Insein, surrounded by the army, rioters set
the buildings on fire and tried to break through the military cordon to
escape. 2 of 6 thousand managed to fight their way out but at least 1,000
prisoners were killed in the continuous outfire of the army. Later, the
government ordered a new amnesty and freed the rest of the prisoners from
the jails, which had become in all cases unusable and uncontrollable, almost
everywhere in ruins... In August and September, more and more soldiers
could be seen with other proletarians. Rifles appeared side by side with
the bicycle spokes and machetes, though the latter remained the dominant
weaponry and beheading the dominant method to kill the bourgeois.
<p>At this point it is important to go into details speaking about the
role played by the different bourgeois factions, and, on the other hand,
about the way the international press reported the events. Two kinds of
pacifism, of non-violent discourses have emerged:
<ul>
<li>
The first one was the traditional propaganda for non-violence: "We demonstrate
peacefully, we demand reforms, rights, amnesty, change of government, and
all this in a peaceful way", (even the catholic priests and nuns joined
the demonstrations in September with the slogan "Jesus loves democracy";
Burma's Supreme Buddhist Patriarch called for restraint while the troops
pursued demonstrators into the hospitals shooting at everybody). Events,
however, quickly surpassed that kind of propaganda. Proletarians resisted
the massacres and the attempts to lead their struggle astray. This is why
the bourgeois opposition pushed by the necessity to stay credible began
to radicalize itself and accepted, and even encouraged, violence against
the ruling faction. The former, absolute non-violence-type discourses transformed
into a propaganda for "differentiated violence".</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
The other pacifism tried to be more... violent! "One may behead soldiers
and policemen of this government because it has no right to exist, terrorism
can be OK but only as a means of installing a pluralistic democracy. BUT,
shoplifting, stealing in offices or boats, looting houses of the rich,
etc. are counter-revolutionary activities. Criminals who take alien properties
will be executed." That was the discourse and the ideology of those radical
democrats.</li>
</ul>
In some towns, where the representatives of the national State administration
had been chased by the insurgents, the local democratic forces, supported
by the commercial bourgeoisie, the professionals and the monks, organized
structures to maintain the production and the market, to defend the private
property,..., leading astray towards bourgeois interests the attempts of
proletarian leadership. But the proletarian movement still wasn't defeated
and kept the strength to fight, strength shown by the constitution of self
defence militias and proletarian organizations in the worker neighbourhoods
of the suburbs and even in whole towns.
<p>The two stars of the opposition, Daw Aung San Kyi and General Aung Gyi,
issued then a call to create an "interim" government "to give democracy
to the people". The call didn't take any effect. Looting continuously spread
and in almost every case the targets were stores of food (mostly rice).
To crush the proletarian resistance, the bourgeoisie resorted to massacres.
<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+2>4. Social tensions within the
Army</font></font></u></h2>
Within the army, known as one of the most disciplined armies of Asia, dissensions
were more and more fierce. The living conditions of the soldiers, while
better than those of the other proletarians, were far from being good.
The compulsory military service was long and hard, the pay was meagre,
the canteen rationed, the iron discipline was maintained by extreme brutality;
corruption was widespread. On the other hand, the army was constantly on
war against the different guerrilla groups. This situation brought along
increasing discontent. The tension had increased so that in August '88
"elements of the army came in the National Bank of Commerce to take under
the threat of their weapons 600 millions of Kyats to be distributed to
the soldiers." -Lib&eacute;ration, 9/9/88-
<p>The discontent and the resistance of the proletarians wearing a uniform
increased day after day. Soldiers participated in looting. Mutinies burst
in several military bases. In at least 3 towns soldiers went over to the
side of the rioters. But in spite of all this the army did not disintegrate;
it always remained master of the terrain and, in spite of defections and
mutinies, the proletariat could not emerge out of and against this structure
of the bourgeois state.
<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+2>5. The Government needs the
opposition</font></font></u></h2>
The vital necessity for the bourgeoisie to deny the class confrontation
taking place in Burma expressed itself in different ways: according to
some there were only "students' demonstrations", or "groups of people"
defending their "specific interests"; according to others it was the defence
of the "general interests of the people", it was "democratization" that
was claimed for. But, during the summer of '88 the difficulty to hide the
tendency of the proletarians in Burma to "anarchy" (2) urged the media
to concentrate on the "political aspects" rather than on the events. The
chorus about the danger of chaos and anarchy was followed by discourses
and declarations of oppositional factions and of daughters of heroes of
independence, etc.
<p>At the beginning of September the government rejected the call for an
"interim government". Maung Maung seemed to have understood the overriding
general interest of his class: to preserve an opposition whose influence
on the movement might become important. Neither the world capital nor its
local managers had any interest in destroying the nascent credibility of
the opposition by letting it enter the government.
<p>Moreover, it is much likely that this premature opening would not have
been sufficient to channel the movement, while it would have risked to
weaken the local bourgeois. Far from being able to understand it, Daw Aung
and her friend, the old General, as well as the grandson of the ex-secretary
general of the United Nations, U Thant, and other democrats would have
been ready to decredibilize themselves in exchange for government power.
But, to let it happen would have been stupid of <b>the</b> bourgeoisie.
It was much more useful that the general strike paralysing several towns
and carried on in Rangoon, could remain a "protest action" claimed by the
"democratic forces", which had just got on the moving train. U Nu, an anti-fascist
bourgeois leader of the early 60s, formed a "transitional anti-government"
with his "League for Democracy and Peace" joining Daw Aung San to try to
channel the general discontent towards the claim for a multi-party system,
for democracy and for the human rights - rights of the good citizen, faithful
patriot, good worker and serious family man!
<p>At this stage, world capitalism had already begun to prepare the future
arrangements and inter-imperialist struggles after the smashing of the
proletarian movement. Since long many countries had already fought to get
a part of the territory surrounded by the Burmese borders, and some of
them were still interested in setting up military bases along the Indian
Ocean coastline.
<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+2>6. The opposition unites to
get rid of the Government</font></font></u></h2>
While riots continued in many places, democrats hurried to take the situation
in their hand. Meanwhile the army "reinforced defensive positions at the
Ministry of Defense, the radio station, the main railway bridge, the residential
district of the ruling elite...". Little by little everything was being
set for the "last" ideological as well as military massacre of proletarians...
Before this, the bourgeoisie took the last step to divide the proletariat
into "criminals" and "democrats".
<p>On 11th September, the parliament decided the ratification of the pledge
to have free elections and establish a multi-party system (3). The New
York Times reported on 13th Sept.: "demonstrators do not follow the official
democratization line or the oppositional groups", which "can not offer
any immediate leader or organization" acceptable for the insurgents. U
Nu, the self-made leader of the "rival government" "appears to have been
mostly ignored by the demonstrators". Tin Oo, former defense minister who
had defected from the Socialist Program Party (the governing party of the
country), Aung San Kyi and Aung Gyi asked protesters "to be patient", saying
that "the people should continue peaceful demonstrations, using the weapon
of moral courage"... By the middle of September, as Time wrote, Burma was
"at the edge of anarchy", because "the government agreed to elections,
but mass protests continued". At this moment, and for a little while, the
balance of forces between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat seemed to
be hanging on, the struggle seemed to have arrived at a key moment when
any action matters concerning to the future events.
<p>The army went on reinforcing its positions. The government went on pledging
to do this and that and the oppositional factions went on preaching democracy
and tolerance as well as the need to avoid anarchy. Then came the call
for the general strike "to demand democracy at once": a bourgeois attempt
to recuperate at least the apparent leadership of the events, which progressed
in fact towards a general refusal of work. We may compare this situation
with that in Poland in 1981, when the Solidarnosc was forced - in order
to protect the state and channel the radicalization of the struggles -
to threaten the government with a general strike. The threat led to a vast
military repression, a coup. In Poland, the same way as in Burma, the general
strike declaration followed a movement that - in practice - had already
refused to work and had organised strikes for a long time.
<p>The opposition tried to recuperate and transform the struggle. But public
order hadn't been restored, the proletarians refused to go home or to go
back to work. After the failure of the attempts of a "soft" recuperation,
the pendulum swung to the other pole: after the carrot, the stick! On 18th
September General Saw Maung seized the power, and imposed curfew. The day
before, in the evening, a group of insurgents had fought against army units
outside of the Ministry of Commerce. Proletarians captured soldiers who
had shot at the crowd. They wanted to kill them, but "the opposition leaders
intervened and pleaded for peace" (Reuter, 19/9/88). Soldiers had their
life saved.
<p>On the other hand, there were no "peaceful methods" used by the army,
which had several reasons to practise the hardest repression: on the one
hand, the general interest of the bourgeoisie was to put an end to the
insurrectional state of the country (surely because of the possible repercussion
and contagion in the neighbouring countries, or elsewhere in the world,
where proletarians can easily identify their own situation with that of
their brothers in Burma); on the other hand, within this general interest,
the particular interest of the Burmese army was to stop the defections.
According to reports, in only one week before the coup some 6,000 soldiers,
marines and airmen joined the insurgents.
<p>Some other factors are also to be taken into account - factors that
push the bourgeoisie to use the "heavy-handed" method: the anger of the
old governing generals confronting the oppositional factions' refusal to
collaborate and the necessity to put an end to the violence raging against
the army, the police and all the signs of richness.
<p>From the moment of the coup (which was a real butchery) strikes and
demonstrations were banned. This coup, as well as that in Poland in 1981,
was not a real change of government (in the sense of the replacement of
a bourgeois faction by another one) but only a purification of the state
carried out by the former local leaders because of the need to get straight
to the point: to protect itself from disorder and anarchy.
<p>General Saw Maung, chief of the military committee, who had been minister
of defense in Ne Win's government (a post he took up again later) rapidly
committed himself, just like Jaruzelski had done it in Poland, to "carry
on" with the reforms, democratization,... Later, the General declared that
he had used the army only "in order to halt social chaos in Burma and ensure
that the elections could be held". The bourgeois oppositional factions
reacted to the coup with mild protests and demanded talks with Saw Maung.
They rebuffed offers of support from the autonomist groups. The Buddhist
monks also lent a hand, issuing a statement calling for the "dialogue"
(remember the role of the church in Poland). At the same time, army patrols
shot to kill without any warning when they saw any group of more than 5
people in the streets.
<p>But the proletariat, weaker and weaker, wasn't yet defeated. On 20th
September the suburb of Rangoon still put up a fierce resistance to the
army. The latter could not enter the quarter, or demolish "the barricades
made of cut pipes and trees. These positions were defended thanks to wooden
spears, bottles of acid mixed with gravel, molotov cocktails and 'jinglees'
(catapults and darts)" -Liberation, 20/09/88.
<p>The day after the coup, groups of proletarians raided police stations
in Rangoon, taking rifles and ammunition. Rangoon radio spoke of a "mob"
of 1,000 attacking police and "killing seven policemen, including two deputy
station commanders". On 21st September, three days after the coup, "the
barricades of the worker suburb of Okkalapa, one of the resistance bastions,
were defeated". Instantaneous executions were innumerable, and the crematoriums
of the country worked day and night to wipe all traces of the slaughter
as soon as possible.
<p>We never got any news of what happened next. The blackout became complete,
concerning the following events of the class struggle in Burma. But in
spite of the silence, we know that violence against our class has increased,
we know that the bourgeois, conscious of the weakening of the proletarian
forces, have increased the cruelty of the white terror to an enormous extent.
<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+2>7. By way of conclusion</font></font></u></h2>
The bourgeois press has fulfilled its function: on the one hand, hiding
and transforming the reality of the social movement (which from revolutionary
became "student", then "democratic", etc.), on the other hand and later
on, simply hiding the reality of the bourgeois terror. But beyond the horror,
beyond the cannibalism of counter-revolution, above all the press tried
to hide the strength of the revolution: it was very difficult for the bourgeoisie
to make the proletarians in Burma leave their own terrain of struggle.
The strength of the proletarian struggle determined the extent of the means
the world bourgeoisie set up for repression.
<p>The difficulty met by the bourgeoisie to crush the proletariat locally
in Burma, shows more clearly than any discourse that the proletarian forces
did not fight for "more democracy", for "a changing of the ruling faction"
(i.e. the change of torturers), but did fight to defend our class interests.
The answer of the bourgeoisie was and will always be a deluge of fire and
blood, accompanied by discourses on the "necessary reforms". The clear
refusal of the proletariat forced the bourgeoisie to develop a very strong
repression immediately. But it could not isolate the most combative and
radical vanguards by granting reforms and making promises. This solution
would have made it possible to isolate the vanguard to massacre it and
this way to crush the proletariat, repressing, torturing slaughtering it
massively. For the bourgeoisie, it would have had the advantage of opposing
one faction of the proletariat against other ones, of imposing its own
lessons, of trying to make people believe that the repression applied by
one particular sector of the bourgeoisie (the army, the fascist,...) was
due to the excesses of a minority of irresponsible proletarians (hooligans,
"terrorists", agent provocateur of the enemy,...). The bourgeois in Burma
do not seem to have been able to arrive at this level of division of the
proletarian forces.
<p>This partial failure is very encouraging for our class and its future
struggles. It means that lessons of this movement will remain alive for
most of the proletarians. If it is true, these lessons will permit the
movement to start again straight away or to reach a higher level of force
more quickly (centralization, political clarity, refusal of divisions and
reforms, knowledge of the enemy's methods and of the necessities of the
revolutionary struggle, etc). Besides, it is possible, even probable, that
some of the (clandestine) structures set up by the proletariat during these
seven months of confrontation have slipped through the net of repression
and are working to maintain the indispensable continuity between the different
moments of the social confrontation, which can't do anything but develop.
The proletarian movement in Burma wasn't strong enough to prevent the repression
(it couldn't be in just one country), but it has probably been strong enough
to slow it down, to diminish it. The bourgeoisie can only develop its repression
WITHOUT LIMIT when the proletariat has lost its capacity of resistance.
Facing a movement of those dimensions, the bourgeoisie was obliged to restore
social peace by repression. But when the proletariat remains strong, the
bourgeoisie has to prevent it from reacting against repression and must
therefore modulate it, limit it.
<p>In Burma the situation has remained quite explosive. The national economy,
paralysed for months during the struggle as well as during the repression,
continues to be hit by (and to contribute to) the effects of the deepening
crisis of the world capitalism. There are shortages, unemployment, misery,
and many proletarians have been fired for having participated in strikes.
All these factors, the depth of the economic and social crisis prevent
the proletarians from respecting the laws.
<p>Although we do not say that the proletarian struggle in Burma during
those months of 1988 can be considered as something of crucial importance
as to the development of interclassist confrontations, it was, at the same
time, an important event of class struggle (also because of the concentration
of proletarians, the proximity of China and therefore, the point of the
possible contagion from one "bloc" to another,...); the exceptionally high
level of confrontation between the two classes in this local case proved
what we had already said many times before: There is not ONE centre of
the revolution that should be the reference or the leadership, the guide
for the struggles everywhere else.
<p>These divisions between "developed" and "underdeveloped" countries,
between socialist or non-socialist, between "aggressive" and "less aggressive"
countries, etc. are based on moralist, progressist and racist conceptions.
They only divide the world proletariat and slow down its struggle. As many
times in other periods and in other places, the proletariat in Burma has
proved that there is only one working class and only one way to make its
(our) revolutionary project triumph. The world proletariat doesn't draw
strength from those who give lessons, or from the experiences of the "mature
proletariat" of this or that area, but indeed from its own practical struggle
against the bourgeoisie to re-appropriate its own history.
<p>Instead of looking for privileged areas and dividing the proletariat
by this way, it is much more important to understand that the emergence
of our class and of its vanguard everywhere in the world is historically
and universally determined by the antagonism between the bourgeoisie and
the proletariat.
<p>The development of the social confrontation, when it becomes acute as
in Burma, tends to revolve around the question of the military confrontation.
This question is essential for the proletariat because it is forced to
turn the weapons of the criticism into the criticism by the weapons (to
prevent the cannibalism of counter-revolution), as it involves the danger
of the social confrontation to be transformed into militarist interbourgeois
confrontation. In order to satisfy its needs and to defend itself, the
proletariat in Burma was capable of retaliating by the arms against the
bourgeoisie. It undertook the military confrontation and the preparation
against the police in a more and more global and general way. Thus organized
and armed structures were created for the self defence of workers' areas,
for the attack of state buildings, for the looting and re-appropriations.
It is important to stress the numerous attempts of the proletariat to organize
itself. Through the information that have filtered, it seems evident that
structures like that emerged. Of course, according to its Machiavellian
vision of history, the bourgeoisie always talks of one unique centre of
subversion, but it seems, that on the contrary, these structures were and
remained strongly decentralised (we regret it but understand it very well).
On the one hand, it can be explained by the will to resist the extremely
violent repression, but, on the other hand, it scatters the proletariat
and slows down its tendency to constitute into one unique centralized force.
<p>So, not having forgotten the lessons of the past, the proletarians in
Burma put forward the necessity to organize and protect themselves very
quickly. But this vigilance against repression, expressing a level of understanding
the real nature of the antagonism, must be surpassed by structuring different
levels of contacts and centralization to reinforce the struggle by giving
it a unique leadership. If, at the beginning, it's mostly the homogeneity
of living conditions, the starvation,... which determined the quick development
and extension of the struggles, very quickly, attempts to generalize the
movement, making contacts between different towns appeared. It is highly
probable that those structures played a role in the refusal of the solutions
the bourgeoisie proposed.
<p>Tens of structures were set up, militants went to ask the militants
of the previous struggles to give them advice on what the necessities of
the struggle are. Many of these newly created groups were opposed to China,
to the USA, to Cuba, USSR,... considering them all alike, as they are in
fact, even if sometimes, still under the influence of nationalism, these
groups stressed the "will for independence of the Burmese people" as the
reason for their opposition (4).
<p>During the violent workers' uprisings that burst out recently (Algeria,
Venezuela, Morocco, Tunisia, Mexico,...) the proletariat confronted the
bourgeois repressive forces - armed with machine guns and armoured cars
- with stones, knives and sticks as their  only weapons. In Burma it was
different: partly due to the continuity they were able to give to their
struggles, the proletarians had drawn lessons and refused to let themselves
be slaughtered, disarmed. First, proletarians used home-made weapons, then,
whilst the movement was developing, they showed that the bourgeoisie would
not have to disarm bleating sheep but proletarians fighting, determined
to defend their struggle. This determination as well as the large number
of deaths in the ranks of the army pushed a lot of soldiers (proletarians
wearing a uniform) to refuse to assassinate their brothers, to desert,
to struggle against the state.
<p>This permitted the proletarians to get more weapons and increased the
destabilization of the state. But, if it is clear that the proletarian
struggle destabilized the army to an extent that soldiers confronted other
soldiers, nevertheless, this destabilization was never deep enough to really
threaten the state. To reach that level the struggle must overpass a lot
of limits, and, for example, practically and directly internationalize
itself, knocking about ideologies such as the "bad management", the false
opposition between "socialism" and capitalism, the "specifically national"
problems, etc.
<p>On the other hand, during their struggle against the state and its repression,
the proletarians did not only refuse to confront the state with bare fists,
they chose the targets according to their/our needs: the needs of our struggle.
They also systematically refused to go where all the forces of opposition,
all the ex-members of the regime, the monks... wanted them to go, that
is to say: to confront the machine guns of the army. Such a refusal expresses
the change from a reaction against misery to an organized action against
the whole society, and it also undoubtably expresses a step forward for
the proletariat. But it is very difficult to give a continuity to it because
of the isolation of the proletarians in Burma. This is the reason why the
bourgeoisie has been able to transform the social confrontation into a
purely militaristic interbourgeois confrontation, a terrain on which the
bourgeoisie is of course dominant today. In the course of such a development
those who gradually take the lead of the movement against its own interests
are the "military specialists": armed groups for national liberation, guerrilla
groups, etc.
<h4>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">* December 1988 *</font></h4>

<h3>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">Notes</font></u></h3>
1. There are many ethnic minorities in Burma that are fighting for the
independence of their patch of land. These autonomist groups are generally
situated along the borders and have been waging war against the government
for more than 20 years while fighting each other as well. The strongest
guerrilla group during the revolt in 1988 was that of the CP of Burma,
which practically didn't intervene at all during the struggles. The next
is the Karens, a real state within the state with its own army of course,
and with compulsory military service, as well, its cops, its universities,
its own laws, lawyers, its highly developed network of production and exchange,...
The Karens occupy a zone of about 600 kms along the Thai border. They are
more than 2 million and 4,000 of them are constantly armed. They represented
in 1988 the second strongest oppositional armed force just after the "CP"
guerrilla group that is situated along the Chinese frontier. The Karens'
principal income come from smuggling.
<p>Right from the beginning of the movement the Karens tried to contact
the insurgents and form "activists" for the combat. Though after the coup,
5,000 to 10,000 young men joined the Karens to learn the army drill; no
autonomist-type demands occurred during the struggle, nor did the proletarian
militants let themselves be enroled by separatist groups during the fight.
Today there are at least 9 groups supposed to be united within the National
Democratic Front, which comprises about 30,000 armed fighters who are in
a constant discord.
<p>2. By these "tendencies to anarchy" we mean disrespect towards private
property, law, etc., we mean disrespect for the bourgeois values and norms,
for those who defend them and for those who teach them. We support this
kind of anarchy and stand for it as the struggle of our class for the satisfaction
of its needs.
<p>3. These declarations had very little effect upon the demonstrators.
No trace of quietening down, content or satisfaction was expressed.
<p>4. It is almost sure that, just as the opposition campaigns and the
slaughters by the government, the autonomist and guerrilla groups participated
in the crushing of the movement, recuperating for themselves the militants
who managed to escape from repression. Enroled as they are, those militants
deviate their hatred for the bourgeoisie into the hatred for the governing
faction and wage war against the latter. Separatist groups lead astray
the armed struggle of our class towards an interbourgeois militaristic
fight for the national autonomy of this or that piece of land.

<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">The so-called discovery</font></u></h2>
12th October, 1492 means for the inhabitants of the continent which is
now called America (after the colonizer), the beginning of an endless tale
of suffering: exploitation, oppression, state terrorism, repression of
any kind of resistance,... still existing today.
<blockquote><b><i>"The capital"</i>, says Marx in The Capital, <i>"was
born running with blood and mud from every pore, from head to foot."</i></b></blockquote>
What is called "the discovery of America", as well as the conquest and
colonization, which followed, is nothing else but the process by which,
at one very precise moment in the past, the capital placed its terrorist
conditions of reproduction. Whereas in Europe the primitive, bloody and
terrorist accumulation of the capital took centuries, during which producers
were evicted and deprived of their means of production (meanwhile, the
other pole of the globe was experiencing a concentration of the capital),
it was done in a few decades on the American land and the global process
only lasted one or two centuries (1).
<p>During the history of the human race, <b>this barbarity, inherent in
the development of the capital</b>, and carried out successfully through
civilization, is one of the most horrifying events that has ever taken
place.
<p>It is no use making comparisons between atrocities, just because the
death of one single human being who resisted the capital's civilization
should move each of his brothers, who all over the world struggle for the
suppression of the system.
<p>Nevertheless, despite the fact that some genocides are given publicity
whereas others remain systematically hidden, at least we want to claim
that the slaughter of human beings which the capital brought about with
the conquest and colonization of the American continent is even worse than
the one of the two World Wars together, including, of course, all the murders
in the concentration camps built by the European and North-American progressive
bourgeoisie in the course of this century!
<p>Denying the festivities that the upper classes of Europe and the whole
American continent are preparing to commemorate the 500 years of such a
"glorious epoch" means opposing ourselves in practice to the ideology that
the capital is forcing on us and means stressing the fact that the terminology
used is a sign of it. "The discovery of America", in the language used
every day at school, at work, in the shops, in the street, etc., may seem
to be no more than the mere, innocent and neutral description of an event.
Nevertheless, if we take the time to think about it, we can realize that
it is, on the contrary, precisely the subjective and interested vision
of the colonizer, the exploiter and of the European dominant class which
carried out a successful conquest and colonization: from its point of view
and only its, a continent was discovered. The natives who lived on that
land <b>never </b>discovered America! Unfortunately, what they discovered
at that time was rather <b>THE BARBARITY OF THE EUROPEAN CAPITALIST CIVILIZATION</b>.
The very grammatical subject of the "discovery" (who discovered?) doesn't
hide very well the historical subject, which shows clearly that it is,
in fact, an <b>interested and partial</b> vision of history.
<p>In the eyes of the capital (the genuine historical subject of the "discovery"
and of the conquest and colonization that followed), it was, <b>indeed</b>,
the discovery of an enormous productive labour force to be used for its
valorization and to enable the capital to set up itself as a mode of reproduction
of human race. In the eyes, let say, of the members of a primitive communist
society that lived on a land called later America, it was a military, political
and cultural <b>INVASION</b>; the beginning of the end of its community,
the beginning of slaughter, work, exploitation and oppression.
<p>What was, on the one hand, the development of the social form of the
reproduction of the European white human race and of its Judeo-Christian
culture with its specific forms of exploitation and cannibalism was, on
the other hand, and according to the faculty for adaptation to that form
of exploitation, either submission in complicity with the local exploiter
classes (only the societies in which the exploitation of man by man had
existed could adapt themselves to that form of exploitation), either a
general physical extermination.
<p>A few months before the 500th anniversary of that fateful day when the
capital started imposing the barbarity of civilization on the whole American
continent, the dominant classes in Europe and in America are preparing
the festivities for 1992 and have got the nerve to talk about celebrating
the "discovery" and the "meeting between two worlds", as if two civilizations
had met on a voluntary basis to improve their respective way of life, whereas,
in fact, the capital led a terrorist and bloody fight to impose itself
on the human beings who then lived in "America".
<p>Therefore it is easy to understand why, among the exploited of that
continent, a still vague movement started to reject and deny this campaign
carried out by all the characters of capitalism: the Church, the Spanish
and American (North, Central and South American) governments, the political
parties, the media, the cinema..., was born.
<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">Rejecting and denying</font></u></h2>
Considering the latter as something which represents the movement that
rejects and denies such festivities, here is one of the first documents,
written almost two years ago, which deals with that.
<blockquote><font face="Comic Sans MS">"The Farmers and Natives Organizations
in the Andes, The National and Native Organization of Colombia (ONIC),
The National Association of Users Farmers - Unity and Reconstruction (ANUC)
and the Union and National Unitarian Federation of Farmers and Breeders
of Colombia (FENAGRO), The National Federation of Farmers and Natives'
Organizations (FENOC-1), The Confederation of The Native Nationalities
of Ecuador (CONAIE) and The ECUANRUNARI Movement of Ecuador, The Farmers'
Confederation of Peru (CCP) and The National Agrarian Confederation of
Peru (CNA), The Single Union Confederation of Farmers of Bolivia (CSUTCB)
and The No Land Movement of Brazil, who met in Bogota (Colombia) on 14th,
15th and 16th July, considering that:</font></blockquote>

<blockquote><font face="Comic Sans MS">1.- Whereas the 500 years of the
wrongly called 'discovery' and conquest of America are near, the governments,
churches, institutions, media, advertising agencies and the big transnational
building entrepreneurs have taken a series of initiatives to 'celebrate'
what they call 'the meeting of two worlds'.</font></blockquote>

<blockquote><font face="Comic Sans MS">2.- There was no meeting on that
fateful day, 12th October, 1492, but rather a military, political and cultural
invasion led by the European continent and more particularly by the Spanish
State, which submitted our population to a brutal genocide and cut down
the political, economic, cultural and mental evolution of our ancestors.
So, what could have been a fruitful exchange of different cultures led
to one culture, the conquistadors', dominating the other using arms and
evangelization on a discriminating and unfair social basis poisoned by
racism.</font></blockquote>

<blockquote><font face="Comic Sans MS">3.- Death, in all its forms, was
the expression of the European civilization on the American land from slaughters
to the physical extermination due to over-exploitation, including tortures
and exports of illnesses and epidemics. 90 million people died as a result
of the killing of the Indian communities: one of the worst crimes against
humanity, which is still going on today, but in more subtle ways, which
are not, for all that, less brutal and ruthless!</font></blockquote>

<blockquote><font face="Comic Sans MS">4.- On behalf of the European civilization,
supposedly superior, the conquerors ruined a large part of the scientific
and technical progress, of the artistic and cultural expressions, of the
languages and the social organization of the indigenous peoples to take
over everything by evicting the farmers from their lands, by plundering
the resources and seizing the fruits of the work of the conquered.</font></blockquote>

<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">Our position</font></u></h2>
The <b>Internationalist Communist Group</b> doesn't hesitate for one single
moment <b>to oppose openly</b> all these festivities which our secular
enemies are preparing and appeals to the international proletariat to resort
to <b>direct action against</b> them.
<p>Billions of dollars have been invested in the festivities and in the
campaigns through which they will build the public opinion they need and
through which they will harass the exploited of the five continents and
more particularly those from America. <b>We appeal to the avant-garde proletariat</b>
to take action against such campaigns; we call on them to make of every
factory, every school, every mine, every office... the place to denounce
parties, trade-unions, governments, media, which take part in the campaign,
to make it the sphere of activity against all the previous capitalists
as well as against the capitalists of today, who, all, with no exception,
have Indian, half-cast, black, white,... blood on their hands.
<p>The ways direct action will be led depend, of course, on the possibilities
and on the balance of forces in each place at a time when the international
weakness of the proletariat facing its historical enemy is acknowledged;
any general recipe would be no more than a mere vain statement. The fact
that we don't call on a generalized sabotage or on an insurrectionary and
revolutionary strike doesn't mean we don't agree with that kind of action,
but it is because, first of all, the proletariat having no international
guidance or conscious common action at the moment, it would only be a dream
and also because throwing rotten eggs or a few Molotov cocktails during
the festivities, going on strike here or occupying places there don't deserve
yet the name of sabotage, neither do they imply there to be any general
leadership. It will rather be a modest expression of <b>the present rejecting
movement</b> that we are struggling for to<b> generalize it and hardenit.</b>
<p>We intend <b>to radicalise it</b> in the deepest sense of the word,
that is to say to go back to the roots. And, as we have already said it,
the root of the problem is our old-aged enemy: the capital, our well-known
enemy, the bourgeois society on the whole, which forced the human race
to submit itself to it. That is why hardening the movement against the
so-called festivities is, and can only mean, a struggle <b>against the
whole capitalism</b>. Moreover, we talk about <b>"generalizing"</b> both
in the quantitative and qualitative expansion of the proletarian participation
in this struggle, in the sense of the confrontation against all the capitalist
forces, and finally, in the sense of the historical relation between this
struggle led by the exploited and the oppressed of the five continents
during colonization to resist the capital, and the nowadays proletariat's
struggle, the everyday struggle against austerity, against capitalist exploitation
and the struggle for the suppression of that criminal system. That's the
reason why denouncing the festivity campaign and confronting it is not
a different struggle, but is rather an additional aspect of the social
war between the exploiters and the exploited.
<p>If the struggle is divided, if its contents which is to be a struggle
against capitalism, turn out to be a struggle for peaceful coexistence
between classes (whether it be on behalf of the meeting between two worlds
or of Latin-American unity against yankee imperialism), that would be a
reactionary obstacle. That's why,through our struggle against these festivities,
<b>we
launch an appeal</b> to face and denounce all the bourgeois, left-wing
or right-wing forces, which will try to make of the historical struggle
against capitalism a mere contradiction among its own factions, between
the "imperialists" and the "others", or, which is even worse, among nations:
between Europeans and Americans, between inhabitants of South-America and
inhabitants of North-America.
<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">Against the bourgeois left-wing</font></u></h2>
Let's take as an example the point 5 of the document mentioned above. Even
if it describes part of the reality, the fact remains that it divides and
alters the aims by mixing everything and eventually dissolves the main
contradiction into another one, which opposes debtors and creditors of
capital, that is to say a contradiction between bourgeois factions, as
we denounced it in our central review in French (2).
<p>This is being done consciously or unconsciously, considering as grammatical
subject what is not the historical subject: Latin-America; and suggesting
continuity between the previous exploited and submitted in all America
and this <b>non-subject</b> which is Latin-America. There is no doubt that
this position corresponds to the Latin-American bourgeois' interests (and
consequently, to those of capitalism), the very bourgeois who stand as
a victim of a genocide in which it deliberately took part.
<p>This conjures up an old story: a South-American journalist, who was
considering Juan Ram&oacute;n Jimenez responsible, harassed him saying:
<i>"...
you, the Spanish, the colonizers,... responsible for the slaughter,...
the obscurantists,... your grand-fathers..."</i> He answered quite rightly:
<i>"It
will be yours, mine, the poor, are overseas in Spain, well buried."</i>
<p>And this is true not only for the Latin-American exploiting class of
Latin and European origin, but also for the bourgeois of Indian origin,
seeing that in many cases the indigenous dominant classes contributed to
the barbarity of colonization. In fact, as we already said above, the natives
who didn't live in a society with class exploitation resisted wage labour
to the death and/or were exterminated (or killed themselves in many ways,
including conscious and deliberate collective infanticide); that's why
most natives of today, who are exploited proletarians, are descendants
of societies in which exploitation already existed; and besides the fact
their own exploiters may have sold them to capitalist bosses, they could
accept wage labour capital imposed on them because they were used to working
for others, to producing overwork for their "own" native bourgeois. For
example, in the Inca Empire, the "mita" and the "yanaconaje" were forms
of overwork appropriation that the capitalism later was going to subsume
in its being, thanks, in many cases, to the caciques, who watched over
labour force.
<p>Latin-Americanism clearly expresses the counterrevolutionary interests
of the left-wing bourgeoisie, who, on this occasion, and as every time
a proletarian movement expands, tries to turn the class war into an international
war of capital (between nations).
<p>The only bourgeois solution to that is:
<ul>
<li>
to hide the real continuity which exists between the previous indigenous
communities the capital exploited and slaughtered to deprive them and make
proletarians of them, and the today proletarians all over the world;</li>

<li>
to hide the real continuity which exists in the Latin-American States,
between the local bourgeois and the previous criminals, presenting the
enemy as external (or showing an enemy abroad).</li>

<li>
to substitute false continuity for the real one, such as asserting that
all Europeans and North-Americans are privileged (so as to divide the common
aims and interests of the proletariat) and presenting them as the heirs
to the colonizing states.</li>
</ul>
We must acknowledge that the enormous lie according to which there are
no poor people in Europe and in the USA, is, objectively, for the proletarians
in Latin-America, as strong as a popular prejudice; and the bourgeoisie
knows how to use it. Only the proletarians' struggle against their own
bourgeois will change this fact. As for now, movements still crop up separately
(unlike in the end of the last century and in the beginning of this one
when there were unity and various levels of coordination between proletarians
in the south, north and centre of the American continent). As far as we
know, even the struggle and reject movement of the 500th anniversary festivities
makes no exception: the organizations which started working against these
festivities in Latin-America were not aware of the indigenous proletarian
movement in North-America until there were very important struggles in
Canada and some others in the USA which stressed, once more, the same history
and the same current interests among the exploited, both in the north and
in the south.
<p><u>To what extent is the protest movement against the festivities infested
or dominated by the left-wing bourgeoisie?</u> It is difficult to respond
to that point so far and, in fact, the very happening of the festivities
and the denouncing of them will tell us about the proletariat's autonomy
from that left wing or, on the contrary, the proletariat's subordination
to it. That's why the determined struggle against the festivities must
always imply the denunciation of the pseudo anti-imperialist left-wing
bourgeois.
<p>What seems to us to be objective is, that in all structures and organizations
which existed before or which have been developing for two years to denounce
the festivities there is an important position of struggle in this respect.
In the various spheres for discussion and reflection that have come out
both at international level and in each country, we can see that proletarians
and proletarian organizations coexist with old leftist or unionist structures
(among which many signed the first communique mentioned above). So, we
notice that a lot of left-wing capitalist structures, from the Cuban State
to the many American intellectual groups or unions of the different countries,
which, at the beginning seemed to be opposing the festivities, submitted
(in many cases sold themselves), little by little, more or less barefacedly,
to the 1992 festivities, and, in many cases, today, they even come to condemn
(sometimes, they quell) those who don't sell themselves.
<p>In the first place, with this article we aimed to expound our position
on the whole, as a group, against the festivities and, more particularly,
we aimed to set out our stand on several topics we received to be denounced
and thought about. Nevertheless, seeing the diversity and contradiction
they contained, we have chosen, in this first text, to limit ourselves
in explaining that <b>our position in the struggle stands against the festivities</b>
(denouncing also, on the whole, the left-wing bourgeoisie).
<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">Against the festivities</font></u></h2>
We will end by reiterating our stand and our appeal to struggle against
the 500th anniversary festivities. Nobody knows exactly the real figures
of <b>the immense slaughter the world capital will be celebrating</b>,
but no one doubts they were dozens of times bigger than those which the
imperialists who won the "First and Second World War" attribute to their
enemies. Recently, some old information has been published and new studies
realized. Researches carried out at the Bekerley University, for instance,
prove that of the 25,200,000 inhabitants of the central region of present
Mexico in 1519, only 1,075,000 survived a century later, which means a
level of extermination (repression, labour, illnesses...) of 24,125,000
human beings. According to a compilation of information made by Adolfo
Colonbrees and published in his work: "<b>To the five hundred years of
the shock of two worlds</b>", Aztecs, Mayas and Incas counted, at the beginning
of colonization, 70 to 90 million of human beings; 150 years later, they
were 3,500,000. Let us add, that, seeing that most natives succumbed because
of capitalist exploitation, the bourgeoisie brought, as a substitution
labour force, the Black from Africa, which cost, according to Jose Chiavenato
in "<u>The black in Brazil</u>", 100,000,000 black human lives to our species.
<p>We must also add that all those, calling themselves Marxists, who praise
progress and civilization, are making themselves accomplices of all this.
In our opinion, it is clear that wavering between supporting resistance
to exploitation (the essence of the historical communist position even
during precapitalism) and supporting the whole of the progress of Capitalism
(the essence of the historical position of counter-revolution, social-democracy),
Marx and Engels will come to support, on behalf of civilization, bourgeois
positions such as, for example, the war launched by the Yankees against
"lazy Mexicans" (3). The Theses of our programme clearly fight against
such positions. They denounce progress, civilization (see thesis 32, a.o.)
and they claim that the present struggle of the proletariat is not the
successor of progress and bourgeois revolution (as social-democracy says),
it is the successor of all the exploited classes of the past. We also include,
among those whom we denounce as accomplices, the so-called followers of
"Communist Left". Indeed, all those who defend that capitalism was in a
progressive phase till 1914 or any other date, all the supporters of the
theory of ascendance and decadence of Capital, inevitably support the criminal
work of the capitalist civilization. Therefore, we are neither astonished
by the fact that in the face of the gigantic generalised campaign of the
Bourgeois State for the festivities of the 500th anniversary those people
didn't say a word, nor by the fact that they have made themselves the accomplice
of the festivities.
<p>We shall end this article on the 1492-1992 festivities by repeating
our call for social war against capital:

<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">Notes</font></u></h3>
1. There might have been preexisting forms of trading capital in America
but, anyways, this is not the right time to enter into arguments to know
whether or not this antediluvian capital succeeded in leading this barbarity,
or to assess how long it would have taken to come, in an autonomous way,
to a generalized submission to exploitation.
<p>2. On that subject, see: "La cuesti&oacute;n de la deuda: basta de versos"
in <i>Comunismo</i> 19, June 1985, "Deuda externa: las fantas&iacute;as
sin salida" in <i>Comunismo</i> 21, February 1986 and "La question de la
dette: assez de prose" in <i>Le Communiste</i> 27.
<p>3. This position is clearly explained in an editorial, which was not
signed, in <i>Neue Rheinische Zeitung</i>: "Democratic Pan-Slavism", a
reaction to "An appeal to The Slaves" of Bakhunin in which it is said,
word for word: <i>"... Will Bakhunin reproach the North-Americans for waging
a 'war of conquest', which, of course, meant a severe blow to his theory
based on 'justice and humanity', but which was carried out successfully
to the advantage of civilization only? Or is it by chance that the wonderful
California was snatched from the lazy Mexicans, who didn't know what to
do with it? Is it a misfortune for the wonderful Yankees to exploit the
gold mines there, to increase the means of transport, to make, in a few
years, of the most appropriate coast of that peaceful ocean, a place with
a high density of population and a busy trade, to build big cities, steamboat
lines, a railway line from New-York to San Francisco, to really open for
the first time the Pacific Ocean to civilization and, for the third time
in history, give a new orientation to world trade?"</i>
<p>As we can see, it's the traditional bourgeois position in favour of
progress and civilization, against resistance to work and exploitation,
which Marx and Engels support here.
<p>Some tried to exonerate Marx saying that he was not the direct author
of that article but, as we know, the editorial staff of the <i>Neue Rheinische
Zeitung</i> was under the sheer and mere dictatorship of Marx. (Engels
MEW t.XXI p.19). Moreover, Engels undertook to stress, in a letter to Herman
Sch&uuml;ler on the 15th May 1885, that this was, indeed, Marx's position:
<i>"As
well as the article against Bakhunin and Pan-Slavism, Marx's work and mine
of that time can hardly not be separated, since there is division in work."</i>
