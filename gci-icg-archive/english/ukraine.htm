<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">1. Introduction</font></u></h2>
Human prehistory self caricaturing more than repeating itself, a lot of
similarities are to find in our different texts treating that period. Indeed!
Far to consider the different revolutionary focuses as many elements separated
one from the other, we conceive them of in the contrary as many distinct
moments <u>ALL</u> taking part at the same dynamic, at the same revolutionary
attempt. It would be methodologically impossible to us to set them apart
to pull out lessons at each time distinctive, pretending here or there
about objective or subjective differences as done by several leftist schools.
(1)
<p>Therefore, it's normal that a whole of common characteristics is found
in what we describe as forces of the revolutionary movement of that period,
like in Russia, in Germany, in Hungary, in Belgium, in England, in Argentina,
in India,...and in so many other places of the world at that period. We
have insisted in our texts on the existing breaking points towards nationalism,
trade-unionism, parliamentarianism, etc. We have also tried to describe
at each time the process of organisation in force of the revolutionary
minorities coming from different political "families" melting into the
same communist party, that process of organisation in Party, culminating
in the attempt to erect in one and only centralised and international force,
the whole of that vanguard.
<p>But if the multiple focuses of struggle of these crucial years '17 -'23
comprise enormously similarities as for their forces, it goes similarly
concerning theirs limits: understanding of internationalism limited at
the addition of national parties, limit of the critic of Democracy, limit
of the understanding of the dictatorship of the proletariat, etc...The
whole of these weaknesses crystallizing in a general limit of that period:<b>
the lack of rupture with Social-Democracy.</b>
<p>And we do not speak here about the "formal" Social-Democracy, as often
the Capital tempts to limit it to the long string of parties federated
within the IInd International, but well, all fused denominations and this
<u>under
any flag</u>, of the totality of reformist forces having had for practice
and as
<u>content</u>, the affirmation of counter-revolution, under the
form of a bourgeois program for the proletariat. By painting itself to
the colours of revolution, Social-Democracy succeeds thus to impose the
capitalistic program to workers.
<p>Social-Democracy gathers in the facts and in a practical, concrete way,
the most suited forces to fit up the Capital, to mobilize the proletariat
for a project which is not of its own, demobilizing at the same time the
proletarian struggle, emptying it from all its revolutionary substance.
In this way Social-Democracy is the poison against which the proletariat
has always fought <u>within its organizations</u>, structures, associations,
independent of the flags whatsoever. This relentless fight has reflected
beyond all "marxist", "socialist", "revolutionary trade-unionist", "anarchist",
"bolshevik", "revolutionary socialist" organizational term,... by the struggle,
often armed, having taken place also <u>within</u> all these groups, independently
of the flag they stuck to. It is well <b><u>the frontier between revolution
and counter-revolution</u></b> that constitutes the fundamental, essential
separation between the world of Wage and Communism, and not any <u>formalistic</u>
term where the flag would classify mechanically some in a camp and others
in the opposite. Neither the label nor the flag are the guarantees of a
real revolutionary practice.
<p>Thus, many of these putting forward the rupture with the Second International,
reproduced the totality of its program, under other names! This was the
case of Lenin and other bolshevik militants in Russia, for example, that
after having resolutely participated in the development of the revolution
in Russia, brought back the totality of the process of rupture with Social-Democracy...
in the framework of Social-Democracy, understood as program, going finally
to assume the local reconstruction of the capitalistic State.
<p>This reminder is fundamental to approach appropriately the question
of lessons of the insurrectional movement in Ukrain. Indeed, about all
this question, a division between two ideological poles has taken place:
on one hand, these, defining as "anarchists", having supported Makhno,
one of the main leaders of the proletarian movement in Ukrain, right into
his errors, and on the other hand, self-proclaimed "marxist" militants,
refusing most of the time, when they did not assert openly with Lenin that
capitalism was better, to open their eyes facing the reconstruction of
capitalism in Russia led by the bolsheviks. They have complementarily refused
to recognize, in the movement in Ukrain, a moment of revolutionary rupture
of our class.
<p>The bourgeoisie can then deal with history: once again, it imposes its
stupid methodology aiming to look for some "all goods" and some "all bads",
blind masses and authoritative chiefs,... It succeeds thus to reduce proletarian
struggle in Ukrain into a war between bolsheviks and makhnovists, or even
worse, into a war between "communists" and "anarchists", instead of seeing
there <u>a confrontation between revolution and counter-revolution</u>.
A confrontation that has effectively taken place between on the one hand,
the
<b>Red Army</b> struggling for the defense of the Russian capitalistic
State in full recomposition and, on the other hand, the <b>Insurrectional
Revolutionary Army</b> constituted on basis of the struggle of proletarians
in Ukrain. But the confrontation between revolution and counter-revolution
gets materialized as well <b>within the Insurrectional Revolutionary Army
of Ukrain</b> between on one side, the forces defending the front with
such or such bourgeois army, and on the other, those opposing to it, for
example! In the same way, this same contradiction, revolution and counter-revolution,
was quite as much present within the bolsheviks (cfr. the "communist lefts"
that have got free from them) than within these who claimed themselves
from anarchism (cfr. the struggle between makhnovists and individualists
or other social-democrat "intellectuals" from the movement).
<p>As an example, here is Arshinov's comment, active participant of the
insurrection in Ukrain by the side of Makhno, about indifferentism of a
lot of these invoking the flag of anarchy in Russia at this moment:
<p>"Most of the Russian anarchists that had passed through the theoretical
school of anarchism, remained out of the way, in isolated circles having
no reason to be at this moment; they sought to go into thoroughly the question
to know what was this movement (the insurrection in Ukrain - NfR) and how
it was necessary to consider it; and they remained inactive, getting over
their inertia with the idea that the movement appeared not to be purely
anarchist."
<p>And further, about "anarchist" individualists:
<p>"But these having no passion of Revolution, thinking firstly about manifestations
of their own "ego", understand this idea (the liberation of the individual
- NfR) to their own way. To each time thaat it concerns practical organization,
serious responsibility, they take refuge in the anarchist idea of individual
liberty, and being based on the latter, attempt to avoid all responsibility
and prevent all organization."
<p>Arshinov in "History of the makhnovist movement" - 1921
<p>Let's explain things clearer. When we approach this part of the history
of struggles of our class that has constituted the insurrection of the
proletariat in Ukrain, the problem is not (only!) to see what are the avant-guards
having asserted <b>theoretically</b> the "dictatorship of the proletariat",
but well above all the real forces having tempted to impose it <b>practically</b>.
Thus, the permanent invocation to "Marxism" from the bolsheviks does not
bring them closer to the communist program than some "revolutionary socialist"
or "anarchist" fractions struggling practically (alongside of "bolshevik"
militants in rupture with their own organization, anyway!) for the generalization
of the revolutionary war, for example. In Ukrain, the Red Army, under Trotsky's
orders, accomplished the worst treasons under cover of the superior interests
of the proletariat, while in its war against the Russian State in reconstruction,
proletarians in struggle against its Red Army, tempted themselves to really
impose the dictatorship of their needs, the dictatorship of the proletariat.
<p>But things are even more complex: those imposing their needs, these
thousands of proletarians in arms, rebels against all capitalistic armies
facing them and tempting to recapture their control, these proletarians
in war against Denikin's and Wrangel's White Armies, Trotsky's "Red" Army,
austro-german armies, Grigoriev's or Petliura's nationalistic bands, these
armed workers therefore, when they attacked the bourgeois, looted the banks,
reappropriated violently the wealths and <u>asserted so their dictatorship</u>.
Very often, they refused to call it just as it is, "dictatorship of the
proletariat", for the good and simple reason that it was difficult for
them to give to their revolutionary action the same name than the one used
by these too busy <u>to develop Capital</u> and to betray the proletariat,
to prevent its dictatorship! And this fear to be terminologically assimilated
to the enemy has been transformed unfortunately also very often into another
ideologized theorisation (while the pretending of anarchism, then!) of
the revolutionary practice they assumed, therefore limiting also this practice.
<p>At this stage, and before our enemies transform once more what we tell,
it is obviously important to emphasize <b>the importance for the flag to
coincide with the action! </b>An indispensable moment of strengthening
of communism as movement lies in its capacity to recognize itself theoretically,
in the totality of its goal, and therefore in the totality of historical
formulations by which it has asserted itself as movement, all along the
history of the classes struggle. If we have insisted here (and if we insist
so much often!) on the importance of the real communist movement, veiled
well often by numerous flags more or less confused, it is because the vulgar
logic has an incorrigible and haunting tendency to impose "what appears"
as "what is", to confuse the flag with the movement and to deny thus entire
patches of the ruptures of our class.
<p>In a word, with these methodological warnings peppered with examples
of the real contradiction between the communism bearing social forces and
those defending capitalism, we want to define the framework of our rupture
with the bourgeois mechanistic methodology isolating the contradictions
around the ideology, chiefs and flags:
<p>- therefore we will describe first briefly in this text the worldwide
struggle context in which the class struggle in Russia is part of;
<p>- we will see then - and quite also briefly - how, in the context of
the victorious insurrection of the proletariat in this zone, Capital has
transformed into fierce agents of its reconstruction those who, some months
earlier, organized in minority within the bolshevik party, constituted
one of the avant-guards of its defeat;
<p>- then we will deal with the proletariat insurrection in Ukrain, facing
Brest-Litovsk peace, another moment of the capitalistic State reconstruction
in Russia;
<p>- and in the framework of this uprising, we will see how the proletariat
will find one of the highest moments of its struggle centralization into
the constitution of the Insurrectional Revolutionary Army of Ukrain, around
"anarchist communist" militants, whose most famous was Makhno;
<p>With this fast description of the viewpoint guiding us (the proletariat
before its "heroes", the class struggle and not the ideological struggle,...),
we want to assert once more what really, essentially separates revolution
from counter-revolution, it is the practice, <b>the real practice of the
struggle centralization around a revolutionary program.</b>
<p>As we have told it above, this practice found in these struggle years,
and independently of its protagonists, a huge limit in the lack of rupture
with Social-Democracy, understood as content, as program, as practice:
Social-Democracy, understood as historical Party of Capital for the proletariat,
it is this force showing Capital defending, maintaining and developing
itself by investing the flags of its own enemies, by incarnating itself
in the flesh of its enemies! Social-democrat program is thus defended by
"anarchists", "bolsheviks", "revolutionary socialists",... pseudo-communists.
These are the most convinced opponents to the counter-revolutionary Brest-Litovsk
peace that transform themselves into its fiercest defenders! These are
the best chiefs of the insurrectional army of Ukrain who associate themselves
monstrously with the warrior capitalists of the Red Army!
<p>But the false polarization between "anarchists" and "communists", as
history vision, still dominating today, it is the triumph of social-democrat
conception. The kind of criticism confusing the social movement in Ukrain
with the flag and coming down to the flag of anarchy's criticism (criticism
generalized from the existence of some black-painted social-democrat ideologies
for better cheating), completes perfectly the imbecile opposite critics
from "anarchists" criticizing "marxists". They assimilate all what is called
"marxist", what is equivalent to put in the same bag whole the revolutionaries
being called "marxists", at the same time as "marxism" transformed into
a branch of Political Economy or a perfectly honest State doctrine thanks
to the works of the (particularly german or russian) social-democrat parties.
Facing all this bloody mess of confusions, it is fundamental to reassert
clearly that the real frontier delimiting the communist project from the
capitalistic project, is not located between "anarchism" or "marxism",
but well between proletarian struggle and Capital development, between
revolution and counter-revolution.
<p>Social-Democracy, product of Capital to workers purpose, don't give
a damn of "anarchist" and "marxist" labels, whatever the supporters of
the ideological formalism tell, and there is no flag behind which it would
not take refuge to cheat workers. In this sense, communist movement, the
real and practical movement of established order abolition, considers as
well as mortal enemies the <b>bellicose</b> Kropotkin and Kautsky, as ministers
Bela Kun in Hungary or Federica Montseny in Spain.
<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">2. War and revolution... up to Ukraine!</font></u></h2>
The triggering of the generalized slaughter of 1914 corresponds to the
necessity of the world bourgeoisie to resolve the crisis of overproduction
to which Capital was confronted. To survive to its contradictions, the
bourgeoisie has to crush the proletariat. It has to liquidate physically
the part of excess-proletariat to its needs of valorization, and to do
that, to stifle also its communist project of destruction of the money
and the exchange, only alternative to the capitalistic barbary. The crossing
point of that <b>crushing of the proletariat </b>by the bourgeoisie will
be done first, by <b>the National and Sacred Union</b>, that nasty pression
that the Social-democracy succeeds to impose between the proletarians and
each of the nations where they're exploited, and second, by the <b>physical
liquidation </b>of millions of proletarians forced then to confront militarily
each other in battles within which the different capitalist sides had prolonged
the relentless competition they went to to conquer such or such part of
the world market, under the form of territories,... (2)
<p>The capitalist contradictions were then, as usual, the crossing point
of that war against the proletariat led by the world bourgeoisie, during
four long years.
<p>During centuries, the french and english States had constituted a gigantic
empire from which they succeed to draw huge benefits, while the german
State, as an imperialism in full expansion in the race for profits, kept
closed in its national frontiers. Unable to find new outlets in faraway
colonies, the german bourgeoisie had to fall back on the european continent
to answer to its needs of expansion. The strategical objective was the
road which came from the heart of the german empire to today's Irak, symbolized
by the Berlin-Baghdad railway line and passing by Istanbul and the strait
of Bosphorus. The expansion of the capital in Germany should obviously
be opposed to mercantile interests of the empire of the Czars in the Balkans,
seeking a way out to the Mediterranean Sea. The politico-military blocks
were constituted by a serie of alliances and of counter-alliances. The
deflagration could then take place between on one side, the french and
english States, shouldered by the empire of the czars, fearing the coming
of the german State as a new rival on the world market, and on the other
side, the german economical colossus and its austro-hungarian allies, seeking
profits at the expense of other less competitive colossus.
<p>There was, of course, never any lack of opportunities to start a war.
Constituted blocs were face to face at different times (Tanger 1905, Agadir
1911, Balkans 1912), but the main problem for the bourgeoisie was to succeed
to impose war and death as perspective for the proletariat of the different
nations. It was the main role of the Social-Democracy: all melted political
families, from different national socialist parties to anarcho-trade-unionists,
from the "socialist" 2nd International to the "anarchist" international
Manifesto of the Sixteen, from trade-unionists of all ideologies to "socialist"
MP's,... all the different social-democrat expressions will call to take
part to the war. On one side (around Germany), they claim a democratic
fight against the reactionary and despotic Czarism, and on the other side
(around France), they invoke the image of the militaristic Teuton to go
to defend republican and democratic France, with flowered rifles.
<p>It's not the right place to develop the whole process used by the Social-Democracy
to impose, through its anti-war democratic speech, the need to be slaughtered
on the battlefields. We'll come back soon on that issue, when we'll talk
about revolution and counter-revolution in Germany.
<p>But the murder of an obscure Austro-Hungarian archduke by a more obscure
Serbian nationalist was enough to trigger the conflict. Sure of a rapid
victory, although other bourgeoisies weren't ready yet military speaking
to face a generalized war, German generals decided to hit westward first.
In a few weeks, the Capital of Germany hopes to realise the victorious
masterstroke of Bismarck which, in 1870, put an end to Napoleon III and
unified in Versailles, under the Prussian king's authority, the whole German
empire. Crashing the French bourgeoisie, Germany could face with all its
military and industrial potential the huge "russian human tide" which is
on the eve of an invasion.
<p>In a two weeks time, the deals should have been done. But the German
bourgeoisie lost its bet; his French homologue was not beaten and it was
in tears that it saw the billions of marks supposed to be brought back
lost in the adventure. No doubt it was an adventure for the bourgeoisie,
but certainly not for the millions of proletarians who, for the benefits
of the bourgeoisie, were crushed, torn to shreds, killed under tons of
irons and steel during four long and terrible years in the cold, rain,
sun, mud, illnesses...
<p>If the bourgeoisie worldwide would have succeeded to make believe to
the proletarians the need to be killed for its interests, it was at the
condition that the carnage would be merry and short in time. But, it was
not really the case! After two years of mutual massacres, proletarians
in uniforms refused to go and be killed at the rhythm of the national anthem.
With strikes in the back, refusal to carry out orders and fraternization
on the front (Champagne 1915, Verdun 1916, Aisne 1917,...) between German
and French proletarians, mutinies, revolutionary defeatism... put an end
to the carnages. From a common agreement, both staffs had to restore "order".
The same bourgeois order which consist to send brothers of the same class
to kill each other. But after two years of butchery, the proletariat was
not ready anymore to go whistling on the battlefields.
<p>The year 1916 marked therefore a qualitative change. From the mass grave
will emerge the most outstanding revolutionary wave this planet had never
known, leading to the October insurgency in Russia, at the prejudice of
the different fractions of the Capital, forced to end that butchery to
repress the proletariat which was about to reconsider years of exploitation
and misery.
<p>No one can imagine today, the effect of the announcement of the success
of the proletarian insurgency in Russia among the working class worldwide.
All throughout the world, communist movement found a new impulsion. That
achieved insurrection took place in a full revolutionary rise, at a time
where successive years of sweat and blood for work and war pushed the proletarians
to reconsider everything.
<p>We'll avoid here the way how more and more determined (and numerous!)
minorities get constituted and gathered everywhere in the world, to definitely
dismantle the old world; we won't develop the links those minorities constituted
and the efforts enterprised to endow in an international organisation aiming
the violent overthrow of the old world. Moreover, we can send our readers
to our different texts found out in the presentation of this issue to go
into thoroughly how, after taking an active part in the organization an
the leading of the insurrection, the Bolshevik party get rid of progressively
the whole revolutionary elements to, on the basis of the democratic illusions
of this old social-democratic organisation, get the agent of a powerful
counter-revolution in Russia.
<p>The transformation of the Bolshevik Party into a fierce agent of the
capitalistic reconstruction find <u>one</u> of its first and more important
cristallizations in the victory that Lenin obtained on all his rivals imposing
the signing of the Brest-Litovsk agreement with Germany.
<p>At that time -early 1918-, the contradiction between revolution and
counter-revolution is taking place between the partisans of peace and the
partisans of revolutionary war. Lenin, Zinoviev, Kamenev and Stalin will
heavily insist to impose to the majority of their organization and the
whole of the proletariat which is opposed to them, the end of the development
of the revolution. For the revolutionaries, it's clear that the insurrection
in Russia was only the starting point of the world revolution, and everybody
knew that if the revolution was not going further, Capital would impose
its dictatorship. The pursuit of the revolutionary war concentrate thus
immediately that stake.
<p>But the capitalistic necessity of reconstruction of the State in Russia
will find its fiercest defenders around the pacifist ideology of Lenin
who aim to preserve Russia, as <b>economy</b>, as <b>nation</b>, as <b>government</b>,
"as <b>stronghold</b>", as he justifies it. So, under the pretext not having
the necessary combativeness to pursue a revolutionary war, Lenin forces
the signing in march '18 of a peace treaty recognizing the occupation by
the German state of the regions of Latvia, Byelorussia, Lithuania and Estonia,
the same treaty abandoning lateral Ukrain to the imperialistic butchers.
But over the given territories, it's the bourgeois order in the area which
is ratified and countersigned by the Bolsheviks, it's the whole proletarian
movement which received a powerful smash-up: the capitalistic peace, the
peace of the graves, social peace will be the real winners of those negotiations.
Moreover, the treaty will give the opportunity to the German army to pull
immense troops out of its eastern front, and to proceed to a huge assault
against France, assault which will be stopped at only 60 km out of Paris
and we can imagine how bloody it was for the proletarians of the region.
The bourgeoisie, not yet reassured, can breath: the imperialistic war is
still going on for a while, pushing away the revolutionary developments.
<p>We have the general tendency to underestimate the opposition which manifested
itself facing these agreements. It was nevertheless a powerful and violent
one, at the image of what it concentrated as contradictions. Most of the
proletarian organizations were against the agreements. The majority of
the Bolshevik organization as well. Trotsky, who played a determining role
in the signing of these agreements, reports:
<p>"Over two hundred local Soviets, in response to the invitation of the
Soviet of Commissaries, stated their views on war and peace. Of them all,
only two large Soviets - Petrograd and Sebastopol (the latter with reservations)
- went on record as being in favour of peeace. On the other hand, several
of the big workers' centres, such as Moscow, Ekaterinburg, Kharkoff, Ekaterinoslav,
Ivanovo-Voznesensk, Kronstadt, etc., voted by overwhelming majorities to
break off negotiations. The same attitude prevailed among our party organizations,
and of course among the left Socialist-Revolutionists."
<p>Leon Trotsky's "My Life"
<p>The "socialists-revolutionaries left-wing" were particularly virulent
and organised, after the signing, an attempt against the ambassador of
Germany in Russia, to break in practice the conclusions of the sinister
signature. Soon after, they lead a riot against the peace agreements, in
Petrograd. "Anarchists" created Black Guard in Moscow to try to organize
the resistance to these agreements. And inside the Bolshevik party, Radek
and Boukharin seem to have even consider seriously to arrest Lenin with
the help of the "socialists-revolutionaries left-wing"!
<p>Obviously, the Brest-Litovsk agreements were not only the result of
the
<b>subjective</b> will of the Bolshevik leaders who succeeded imposing
it. It was more largely the fact of an <b>objective</b> balance of forces
still not in favour to the proletariat, balance of forces marked at that
time, for instance, by the delay of the German insurrection (the proletariat
in that country being unable to prevent the pursuit of the war!), and more
globally, by the limit of ruptures with the pacifist and reformist ideologies
the bourgeoisie deployed to offer an alternative to the revolutionary velleities
of the proletariat. But we will not insist here about the long developments
we have given to that question in our article "La paix, c'est toujours
la paix du Capital", about the Brest-Litovsk agreements in our issues 22
and 23 of our central review in french.

<font face="Comic Sans MS">oOo</font></h2></center>
We put an end to this introduction about the development of the war and
its revolutionary antagonism, giving a few elements about the stake Ukraine
represented in imperialistic terms for the different blocs and nations
in presence.
<p>In the gigantic chaos represented by the general mutual tearing of the
capitalistic nations in war at that time, Ukraine played a basic strategical
role. Grain'store of Europe, the possession of these vast superficies should
able Germany to face the maritime blockade imposed by England. Its conquest
got a primordial strategic factor as a necessity for the German Capital
to feed "its" proletarians on the frontline as well as backward to maintain
its social peace, so important for the pursuit of its war's goals.
<p>In the same line, the different resources of its soil, like the important
coal and iron mines Ukraine was overflowed, should replace the colonial
imports seized by the French and England navies.
<p>Since the very first days of the war, Ukraine will constitute a fundamental
stake that all fractions of Capital will look for. Then, we will see all
the armies of the region marching one behind the other to literally loot
this gigantic region and to contend ferociously for it: Russians against
Austro-Hungarians and Germans, the bloc around Germany against the government
of Kerensky, and later, the same bloc with the Ukrainian nationalists against
the armies of the Russian State painted in red, and later again, the same
"Red" armies against the White armies...
<p>It's in all that <b>contradictory context</b>, where the <u>development
of the revolution</u> is still at the day's order, with the struggle of
the proletariat against the bourgeois war and the progressive affirmation
of its perspectives, but also at the moment when the <u>counter-revolution
is spreading</u>, finding within the Bolsheviks agents useful to its development,
it's in that context, after the Brest-Litovsk agreements and the entry
of the German armies in Ukraine, the proletariat of that region will uprise
and organize an insurrection which will last almost three years, against
all the bourgeois armies which will tempt to take the control of it.
<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">3. Revolutionary war in Ukraine, against
Brest-Litovsk (march 1918 - december 1918)</font></u></h2>
The revolutionary struggle in Ukraine does not obviously date from the
reactions to the war. These reactions inserting in an history and a context
of particularly rich struggle, that we can represent here in only a few
lines.
<p>The great famine of 1891, and the epidemic of cholera of 1892 following
it, have awoke the wraths of the rural proletariat against the exactions
of the bourgeoisie. And it's on that encouraging field that "anarchist"
revolutionary minorities get organized, acting and asserting communism
as perspective.
<p>In 1902, the proletarian insurrection of Kharkov and Poltava started,
where the countryside's proletarians refuse to pay the tax, carry on to
massive reappropriations, to expropriations and redistributions of land
properties.
<p>In 1905, proletarian revolts in the countrysides, where the "socialist-revolutionary"
minorities have enormous influence (cf. self-proclaimed groups of "Zemlia
i Volia": Land and Freedom), open the revolutionary era. In the cities,
workers's riots follow one behind the other particularly in Ekaterinoslav.
In the countrysides real jaqueries are taking place: arsons of properties,
of large landowner's estates, destruction of accountabilities, expropriation,
and redistribution of lands,... the "Black Share", or "The land to those
who work it".
<p>The decree of Stolypin in 1906 will try, like the Bolsheviks later,
to break the solidarity of the rural proletarians against the great landowners,
creating peasants middle "class" (the kulaks), to attempt to put a definitive
end to the permanent turmoil in the countrysides.
<p>The story of these very violent clashes with the bourgeoisie and the
maintaining of the extremely harsh conditions of living, despite these
struggles, won't lead to a "merry" entry into the war! A lot of proletarians
will jib at leaving their poor tiny plot of land to go and be killed thousands
of kilometres away for a cause which seems quite obscure for them. The
declaration of war to Germany, on august 2nd 1914, arrives short before
the harvest's season, and the proletariat of the countrysides will be mobilised
with the troops in its back.
<p>As we have seen it above, two years of war will be enough to destroy
social cohesion. It's over to be russian, german, austro-hungarian, french...
In 1916-1917, everything explodes and in February 1917, similar movements
to Petrograd's rise against the government of Kerensky, and its local materialisations
in Ukraine. Soviets bloom from everywhere and even an ukrainian parliament
(the Rada), where the nationalist tendencies of the local bourgeoisie can
find a tribune. The Petliurists (3), those Ukrainian nationalists, will
be the more active inside that Rada. Nevertheless, in the countrysides,
the "socialists-revolutionaries" and the different "anarchist" fractions
will stay predominant. The "anarchists", under the leading of among others
Semeniuta, have until 1910 led a huge work of propaganda, and proceeded
to different demonstrations of worker's direct action: banks lootings,
expropriations of important landowners, vengeance against the little chiefs
(4)...
<p>With the confusion following the October insurgency and the changes
involved in it, several local bourgeoisies try to reply to the local revolutionary
movements by the constitution of independent countries: Finland, Poland,
Ukraine, Georgia... In February 1918, Austro-German armies invaded Ukraine
and, passing up through the Baltic states, come to 150 kms of Petrograd.
Then, the Bolsheviks ratify the peace of Brest-Litovsk which, as we have
briefly reminded above, will give the signal for the reconstruction of
the State in Russia, and allow the progressive smashing of all revolutionary
velleity, letting other bourgeois fractions to finish the job in other
regions. Therefore, struggling Ukrainian proletarians will be bound hand
and foot, send to the Ukrainian and Austro-German bourgeoisies, momently
freed of any revolutionary pression.
<p>Therefore, the proletariat can only uprise and fight. And it's a fundamental
point to remind that fact: <u>the proletariat, <b>from its own materialistic
interests</b>, could do nothing but to uprise!</u> There was no way at
any moment to accept the Bolshevik program imposed by the Brest-Litovsk
agreements! Facing all the classical counter-revolutionary justifications
of the leftist organizations, from the trotskysts to the maoists not to
mention the leftists of "Programme Communiste" or Battaglia Communista
and others, who argue the necessities of these peace agreements... "because
the proletarians had to feed themselves" (!!!), the facts have to be reminded,
to indicate in evidence the historical materiality and to pretend that
the only thing these agreements will give to the proletarians in Ukraine
(omitting the other questions right here),... was bullets and shells! <u>The
peace agreements, it's the German army which looted the fields and the
grain's stores reappropriated by the proletarians; it's the come back of
the Ukrainian landowners kicked out a few times before; it's the famine
for the proletarians and the bullets if they tried to resist.</u>
<p>By these concrete conditions, which have nothing to care about the so-called
historical considerations of the leftists, the proletariat couldn't materially
accept for a single moment "peace agreements" which disarmed them and pushed
them to the famine! It was not an ideological question, but a practical
one!
<p>Indeed, in the Ukraine, given by the Bolsheviks to the White armies,
the German troops put the hetman Skoropadsky, a rich landowner, at the
head of the State. With the assent of that new government, the German army
proceed to the looting of the region, raising everything they needed to
keep going its warry campaign and bring back raw material, wheat, cattle,...
to the back of the front and even in Germany. Hundreds of thousands of
trucks won't be enough to carry all what the emissaries of the German bourgeoisie
have taken.
<p>On the other side, as a price for the looting committed by their Austro-German
homologues, the Ukrainian bourgeois can get back the goods expropriated
by the revolutionary movement a few times before. The landowners retake
their properties and persecute all who are opposed to them. When the proletarians
resist and try to defend the goods they have retake to the bourgeois, they
are executed without any kind of trial. It's important to notice here again
that independently of all speeches about the liberation or the national
independence, Austrian, Ukrainian, Russian or German bourgeois, all agree
to crash the proletarians, to send them back to work, to submit them to
exploitation and to execute them if they resist.
<p>But from June 1918, the limitless repression which submit the proletarians,
will force them to react to bourgeois assaults. Combined to the generalized
revolutionary offensive in Russia which reinforce their own combativeness,
from every side, insurrectional acts emerge against the Ukrainian landowners
and against the Austro-German armed forces. The proletarians from the cities
as well as those from the countrysides confront them, evict the landowners,
and get armed against the work of police of the Austro-German army.
<p>To these proletarian reactions are opposed the unmerciful White terror.
In the villages, the proletarians are massacred by hundreds. The houses
are burnt, all what they possess is destroyed. But the determination of
the bourgeois forces then the proletariat in Ukraine to realize a first
qualitative step in its struggle against those who massacre them: they
are organized in groups of franc-tireurs and resort to a war of ambush.
From everywhere, and as they were animated by an invisible leader -<u>the
communist movement!</u>-, a surprising number of proletarians are organized
in groups to lead a war of partisans against the landowners and the Austro-German
military forces which protect them. Without any technical coordination
in the beginning, but very organically, as emerging from the desire not
to die without fighting to the end, units composed by 20, 50 or 100 well
armed proletarians and moving with horses, assault the properties by surprise,
attack the National Guard (the Varta) and confront all their enemies. The
grand landowners who persecuted those they exploited are themselves denounced
to the groups of partisans and threatened to be suppressed if they persist
in their exactions. The German cops and officers are promised to a certain
death. The whole of these actions of Red counterterror will be daily realised
in all the Ukraine during all the summer 1918, from June until August.
<p>The wild repression used by the combined forces of the hetman Skoropadsky
and the German staff, can only determine the armed fighters of the proletariat
to realize a second qualitative step in their fight, regrouping more and
more, and progressively centralizing them around their most combative fractions.
Great armies of partisans constituted then around proletarian militants
like Korilenko in the region of Berdiansk, Stchuss and Petrenko-Platonov
in the regions of Dibrivka and of Grichino...
<p>In Southern Ukraine, around the region of Gulai-Pole, the unification
of the units of partisans are not setting only for the defence against
the White terror. Here, the proletarians are organized in the aim to definitely
defeat the counter-revolution led by the grand landowners. The centralism
of the insurrectional forces asserts as main objective, the constitution
of the revolutionary workers of the cities and from the countrysides, into
one organized force to demolish the whole present bourgeois society: their
program is the communist revolution, their flag -black-, is a classless
one! The most important role in the unification of the partisans and the
assert of a revolutionary program is the work of a young communist militant
of 29 years old, coming from that region: Nestor Makhno.
<p>A bit later, in November 1918, when the revolutionary movement in Germany
and in Austria will reinforce the defeatist movement in the German and
the Austrian troops in Ukraine, leading them to progressively withdraw
of the region, new enemies will appear at the horizon under the shape of
the nationalistic armies of Petliura, and moreover the terrible White Armies
of Denikin. From that point, the insurgency in Ukraine naturally -and mainly
in its southern part-, is organized, is centralized and unified around
the revolutionary program of Makhno, and of other communist militants,
finally forming a single <b>Insurrectional Revolutionary Army.</b>
<center>
<h2>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">oOo</font></h2></center>
The process by which the insurrection in Ukrain get gradually organized
around a revolutionary program, shows clearly the importance in similar
movement of revolutionary militants's presence, of <b>a beforehand constituted
avant-garde, formed and determined to revolutionize the world in its totality.</b>
As one can see, these communist nuclei crystallize the struggle of thousands
of proletarians, by clarifying its perspectives, by revealing the program
it contains, by organizing the social movement. They do not create the
struggle,
<b>they lead it</b>. Yes, they lead the struggle, they give a
direction, <b>they impose the dictatorship of the needs of the social class</b>
within which they fight, with all due respect to all the reformists bleating
"marxism" or "anarchism" in fields of democracy (5).
<p>Contrary to the idealistic romanticism, the ukrainian insurrection is
obviously not the subjective fact of a lonely brilliant combatant capable
to convince people to struggle: it is first and foremost <b>a spontaneous
reaction of proletarians in struggle facing the bourgeois terror</b>, often
to the initiative of some fractions of more determined combatants.
<p>But if revolutionaries do not create the struggle, <b>they crystallize
it</b> and <b>allow the realization of several jumps of quality</b>:
<p>- by asserting permanently speaking the necessity to centralize always
stronger, until composing only one great common force facing the class
enemy;
<p>- by formulating each time more precisely the Social Revolution and
Communism, as the only perspective to definitively put an end to the World
of Wage;
<p>- by tracing at each instant the class frontier separating revolution
of counter-revolution.
<p>We will see further the immense weaknesses and the huge illusions present
in the program of the Insurrectional Army of Ukrain, led by Makhno, but
in the framework of the unification realized around the struggle against
the several attempts to break the revolutionary movement in Ukrain, it
is necessary for us first to underline the force of these militants who,
with their guns, managed to formulate <b>the communist revolution as the
only perspective</b>, denouncing and organizing the struggle against the
Petliura's and other Grigoriev's nationalistic bourgeois alternatives,
advocating the revolutionary defeatism within the austro-hungarian armies,
exerting the red terror facing the white armies and the landowners, <u>even
revealing the bolshevik Red Army for what it was: an army of the capitalistic
reconstruction in Russia</u>!
<center>
<h2>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">oOo</font></h2></center>
In November 1918 therefore, the austro-german troops begin to withdraw,
while staying subject to the pressure of the combatants of the Insurrectional
Revolutionary Army. This pressure consisted in advocating the generalization
of the <b>defeatist movement</b> within these armies, by making revolutionary
propaganda, while leading repeated attacks against their military forces.
<p><b>Revolutionary defeatism</b> is a decisive question in the framework
of the communist reply to the bourgeois war. For communists, the war is
only the continuation of the capitalistic peace or, better says, another
moment of the permanent war from bourgeoisie against proletariat. But this
"other moment" of the dictatorship of bourgeoisie upon our class requires
for the worker struggle, <u>precise orders</u> for <b>action</b>, clear
perspectives. In this way, Lenin, Liebknecht, and many other revolutionary
militants reaffirmed in the years 1914-1915, facing the soft and without
perspective pacifism of the social-democrats, the necessity to <u>struggle
against "his own" bourgeoisie</u>, in the form of explicit orders and resolutions.
<p>Where the pacifists were ap-"bleating" to stop the war, without other
proposal, the communists opposed the revolutionary perspective by calling
for the <u>fraternization between soldiers</u> of the various armies, by
proposing to
<u>return guns against "their" officers</u>, by denouncing
the <u>real enemy</u> of the proletariat in <u>"its own bourgeoisie"</u>,...
in a word by encouraging the <u>defeat</u> of "its" own country, <u>the
homeland putting policemen in its back!</u>
<p><u>Revolutionary defeatism</u> is thus the direct realization of the
revolutionary confrontation facing the war by which the proletariat shoots
against these holding the gun under its throat. It continues by the
<u>revolutionary
war</u> of which it is matter here, and aiming to lead the confrontation
within a bourgeois army by tending always more towards
<u>distinguishing</u>
these commanding from these suffering some orders, so as to
<u>clarify</u>
the permanent existence of the <u>class contradiction</u> within the army
led by the bourgeoisie, and to encourage the development of the former
into a
<u>class war</u>, until the contradiction existing within the bourgeois
military institution explodes openly <u>obliging everybody to choose his
camp</u>, and then transforms itself into a violent crisis standed out
by the decomposition of the military structure, then by its final destruction.
<p>Back to the revolutionary war in Ukrain, each time detachments of the
makhnovist army attack the austro-german troops and win (what became increasingly
frequent at this moment of full decomposition of the armies of the german
imperialism), they proceed to the same way and obey to the same rules:
they kill the officers, as relentless defenders of the bourgeois army,
and even often executioners of their own soldiers, and liberate the private
soldiers made captive, except for these guilty of violence acts towards
proletarians. To all the others, they propose to return at home and to
tell the social revolution taking place in Ukrain. Revolutionaries distribute
also pamphlets and texts so as to encourage the soldiers to join the revolution
in Germany and in Austria. Here is the Arshinov's (6) testimony, an "anarchist-communist"
revolutionary militant who fought by the sides of Makhno, about the tasks
the makhnovist detachments assumed in the framework of resistance acts
taking place in the region:
<p>"Tasks of his company were: a) undertaken actively a propaganda and
organization work among peasants; b) to lead an implacable struggle against
their enemies. At the basis of this struggle was found the principle: all
landowner proprietor persecuting peasants, all agent of police of the hetman,
all German and Russian officer, as mortal and implacable enemies of peasants,
had to meet no mercy and to be suppressed (...) In a two or three weeks
time, this detachment became already the terror, not only of the local
middle class, but also of austro-german authorities."
<p>Pamphlets in german and in several dialects are printed by the revolutionaries
to serve as tool of defeatist propaganda, and to dislocate austro-german
troops serving as watchdogs to the local bourgeoisie. From that time, the
resolutely internationalist side of the movement shows its forces.
<p>Several detachments of partisans will be composed of proletarians of
Ukrain, but there are also detachments with proletarians native of Greece
(there are important greek colonies around the Black Sea), Germany, Hungary
Austria or Jews,... There are also detachments of Great-Russia. Indeed,
the defeatist propaganda is a propaganda that, because its aim is generalizing
revolution, realizes also an important unification of the proletariat around
its real tasks. So several bolshevik detachments, sent from Russia where
they were based, whereas they are dispatching on the spot to struggle also
against hetman Skoropadsky, disobey to the bolsheviks orders and submit
themselves in the struggle to the makhnovist's discipline (7). Later, this
will be whole of the Red Army regiments that, won over to their cause by
the defeatist propaganda, went over to the Insurrectional Revolutionary
Army of Ukrain.
<p>This way to proceed is the concrete and clear materialization of the
<b>revolutionary
war</b>, advocated some months earlier by the whole of the revolutionary
forces of the proletariat against the bolshevik minority gathered around
Lenin, during the Brest-Litovsk negotiations. The activity of the proletarian
militants in this region of Russia is the material proof of the possibilities
to lead the international revolutionary war, it is the practical negation
of all the arguments advanced by Lenin to sign this shameful, demobilizing,
and counter-revolutionary peace with the armies of the bourgeoisie!
<center>
<h2>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">oOo</font></h2></center>
Whole this take place between November and December 1918. As soon as the
austro-german troops have withdrawn, the government of hetman Skoropadsky
runs away and provokes the fall of his regime.
<p>The Makhnovchtchina (8) is found from then on facing a new enemy, taking
advantage of the anti-austro-german nationalistic wave to organize: the
Petliura's ukrainian nationalists.
<p>The social nature of the "petliurovchtchina" is the ukrainian nationalistic
bourgeoisie, in search of an independence for the ukrainian patriotic organization
of work and exploitation. As always, this kind of autonomist movement was
mainly organized around the liberal bourgeoisie, by conciliating the interests
of the countryside bourgeois and the liberal "intelligentsia", while using
local proletarian revolts to divert them to their profit.
<p>It is anyway on basis of the immense enthusiasm following the departure
of the austro-german armies and hetman Skoropadsky, that this nationalistic
movement is booming. Petliura makes everything to put himself to the centre
of the victories realized on the imperialistic austro-german armies, and
gathering thus quickly huge masses through whole of Ukrain around his own
figure of national hero. Southern regions, where proletarian revolts had
organized in force around their own program, around the flag of social
revolution, are the only regions where the nationalistic movement had only
few grip and is directly denounced for what it is: a new recipe to submit
the proletariat to work.
<p>But the Petliura's Government of the National Republic had not the time
to take advantage for a long time from his popularity. Hardly set up, in
December 1918, while Skoropadsky had withdrawn, he have to run away a month
later, in January 1919: the social basis on which was based his power vanishes
at the same time that proletarians's illusions about his capacity to change
deeply their situation. Petliurism will collapse as quickly as it had built.
The majority of proletarians who had rejoined it for a while withdraws
now from its army, hostile to the new established power, rejoining often
the forces of the Insurrectional Revolutionary Army of Ukrain, gathered
around "anarchists-communists". The rest of its army will remain nevertheless
sufficiently active to confront the Red Army, when this will begin to make
one's way towards Ukrain to lay the reconstruction of the Russian State.
<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">4. The doctrinaire anarchism to the service
of capitalism (November 1918 - June 1919)</font></u></h2>
Meanwhile this unsettled time, between November '18 and June '19, the "anarchist-communist"
militants (9), gathered around Makhno, will try to manage the "liberated
region" (a radius of 100 kilometres around Goulai-Pole, populated with
more or less two millions of inhabitants). And it is here that the insurrectional
movement shows its weaknesses and its contradictions, because it did not
manage to break the link joining it to the Capital by the intermediary
of its lack of programmatical rupture with Social-Democracy.
<p>This lack of rupture is to understand <b>objectively</b> in the framework
of the generalized impossibility at this period to conceive the dictatorship
of the proletariat, as the definitive effort to abolish the value and the
exchange, this fact being due, among other things, to the work of occultation
accomplished by the Second International, around the contributions realized
by Marx on this question. But it is also important to denounce this lack
of rupture with reformism in its <b>subjective</b> fact, that is to say
in the anarchist and managerial ideologies that have been useful as justification
to proletarians, and more specifically to the makhnovist militants, to
carry on concretely the non-destruction of the Economy, and therefore the
non-destruction of the State, in so far as the former is only the organized
expression of the Value.
<p>The proletariat in Ukrain prevents itself therefore drawing benefit
from the victories won against bourgeoisie. Indeed, the bourgeoisie locally
defeated, the proletariat has the power in its hands. It assumes the despotic
control of the means of production (in countrysides and cities, bourgeois
have been expropriated,...), but it does not know what to make with and
stays paralysed. Not only that it does not really try to <u>generalize
geographically the struggle</u>, but facing economy, it stays without initiative
and does not assume its <u>real destruction</u>. From then on, incapable
to secrete a real direction and a program to destroy Capital, the anarchist
ideology, under its self-managerial and federalist aspects, is going to
consolidate the proletariat's weaknesses by erecting its reformist principles
as authority. The proletariat's incapacity to join together with the other
communist forces worldwide, and the lack of link with the history of communism,
as program, is going to allow to Social-Democracy (under the features here
from the anarchist ideology) to empty ferociously the torrent of the social
revolution to bring it to the sweet and calm waters of conversion, improvement
of wage surviving and NOT of its destruction. Instead of destroying waged
labour, and therefore the very source of Capital, the Makhnovists, by calling
upon their "libertarian principles" are going to manage it by the means
of "peasant communes", called: "Communes of Work" (sic!), or "Free Communes"
or also "Commune Rosa Luxemburg".
<p>In these territories where the governmental order has disappeared, and
where the disorganization of the Capital reaches its height, the makhnovists
will crystallize the stopping to the decomposition of Economy by advocating
its democratic management. Worst, on the pretext of not wanting to impose
the authority on this question, they will advocate the federated organization
of free agricultural Communes and the self-management of factories and
other manufactures, by proposing to city and countryside proletarians to
base their relationships on barter, on the mutual exchange of the respective
products of work. We might as well say that these "councils" <u>were</u>
the authority and made well obviously strength of law, in so far as the
influence they had, based on the just trust the proletarians showed to
them of whom they had crystallized the direction during their victory on
the austro-german armies, materialized directly in force all suggestion
made!
<p>This beginning of federated social organization, did obviously not realize
the continuation of the immediate struggle that proletarians led practically
against work and for the immediate satisfaction of their human needs (struggle
against value, for the extension of the worldwide revolution,...), but
constituted well rather the self-managed social (re)organization of the
existing system of exploitation (10).
<p>The revolutionaries gathered around Makhno had very well understood
the importance to oppose by authority, force and terror facing to the bourgeoisie
as military force; but this comprehension stopped as soon as they were
found facing to the bourgeois program under the form of exchange, facing
to the organization of the State under form of the dictatorship of the
value. Here, Economy took back whole of its rights. The makhnovists, of
whom their anarchist ideology restricted to them the vision to the bourgeois
liberalism, proposed to the proletarians to freely take in hands their
destinies by deciding themselves the quantity of time they wanted to work
and the way they wanted to manage the results of their work. As if proletarians,
alone or organized into Commune, had the time to be free facing to the
laws of exchange!!! Economy, as abstracted organization of the valorization
movement, was obviously the great winner of the self-management reforms
realized to the initiative of the makhnovists.
<p>Facing the social organization of Work, the makhnovists did nothing
but
<b>imposing</b> (could it be by the influence of the ordinary "good
advice" they gave, as one has seen it!) its self-management: the Capital
continued to prevail, but now, it was the city and countryside workers
who managed their exploitation by the Capital. They could thus decide themselves
the exchangeable quantities between various products, and deluding themselves
that the prices had disappeared. While the foundation -the regulation of
exchange by the means of the quantity of work crystallized in each merchandise-
therefore the Value, brought them in reality to determine the quantitative
relations between the products into exchange.
<p>The monstrosity so produced, was finally to camouflage the reality of
waged Labour, Exploitation and Capital, whole forces that perpetuated themselves,
behind hazy pseudo-communist ideologies. Volin's libertarian proposals
rhymed here with Lenin's "socialist" decrees. While the bolshevik thinks
suppressing money by decreeing the abolition of the currency, the libertarian
believes realizing communism by federating the value and by imposing the
barter!
<p>And if militants like Arshinov were very capable to disclose confusingly
(11)
the traps of the bolshevik Economy...
<p>"... we have to deal with a simple substitution of the private capitalism
in a capitalism of State. The communist nationalization of industry represents
a new type of reports in the production, with which the slavery, the economic
subjection of the working class are concentrated in an alone dawns: the
State. In fact, that does not improve the situation of the working class
at all. The obligatory work (for workers, of course) and its militarization
- is the own spirit of the national manuffacture." (12)
<p>... they were on the other hand well incapable to make more than the
lamentable apology of the makhnovist limits:
<p>"The peasants and worker liberty, told the makhnovists, belongs to themselves
and can suffer no restriction (...) As for the makhnovists, they can only
<b>help
them</b> by either one <b>advice</b> or <b>opinion</b> and to put to their
disposition the necessary intellectual or military forces, but they want
in no case <b>to prescribe</b> no matter what this is (...) Volin, admired
by peasants, translated their thoughts and their aspirations: the idea
of free Soviets, working in agreement with desires of the laborious population,
links between peasants and city workers, based on the mutual exchange of
the respective products of labour, the idea of a libertarian and egalitarian
organization of life..." (13)
<p>Arshinov in "History of the makhnovist movement" -1921-
<p>As one sees particularly well in the former paragraph of this quotation,
one only would have to replace Volin by Lenin, and "libertarian" by "socialist",
and we would have the same bourgeois democratic apology of the Soviets!
Facing all these evasions about democratic and free self-organization of
the Soviets, what proletariat needed the most, is that its avant-garde
shows as much determination imposing the liquidation of Value, Exchange
and the international generalization of revalorization, as it had to lead
the armed insurrection against these who personified it!
<p>The central question was the <u>centralized organisation</u> of production
<u>according
to the human needs</u>, and therefore against profit. This allows
<u>immediately</u>
a reduction of the quantity of work (in extension and in intensity), by
the immediate liquidation of all that is not useful to human being. From
then and the application of the principle "who does not work does not eat",
one forces the officials of the State and other bourgeois to take part
to the collective effort against the generalized market production. The
suppression of the whole useless functions and the liquidation of industries
producing nothing, with a view to increase the wellbeing of the proletarians,
involve the growing automation of the whole tasks of production, all these
measures being necessary and unavoidable to attack fundamentally the waged
slavery. Accordingly this kind of measures (completely insufficient, but
marking out the way!), a growing number of proletarians is also thus delivered
of the productive tasks and can devote with once more force to the worldwide
extension of the social revolution.
<p>The makhnovists did not make this. As one has seen, they were contented
with recreating the separation between city and countryside, between "workers"
and "peasants", between intellectuals and manuals while pushing each of
these categories of Capital to ignore themselves, to understand the social
revolution only as federal and fragmentary management of his small misery.
<p>The federalist ideology of anarchism allowed only one thing: the isolation
and dislocation of the revolutionary movement, its dispersion in localist
self-management mirages. The Makhno's himself regionalist and federalist
ideology was a curb to the generalization of the revolution. Thus, when
in 1920, he has to define the "Makhnovchtchina's Aspirations" (extract
from a pamphlet written by Makhno: "What is the Makhnovchtchina?"), he
says:
<p>"The Makhnovist's insurrectional movement aspires to create from the
revolutionary peasantry, an organized and real force, capable to fight
the counter-revolution and to defend the independence of a free region."
<p>As one can see, the social-democrat idea of socialism in only one region,
that will later become with Stalin and Boukharin, "Theory of socialism
in only one country", was as dear to Makhno as to the Bolshevik governmental
right wing.
<p>The worst, it is that a revolutionary leader as Makhno stayed captive
of the "stalinist" prospect before "stalinism", and that, in the heat of
worldwide revolutionary wave, in a time where from Berlin to Patagonia,
from Bombay to Mexico, from Budapest to Toronto, the proletariat struggled
for the
<u>one</u> worldwide revolution!
<p>The limit of the insurrection in Ukrain will find thus, beyond objective
problems of relation force in this period, new agents in the lack of generalization
of the revolutionary war. The "anarchists-communists" in Ukrain had perceived
and criticized the weapons in their hands, the refusal of the generalization
of the revolutionary war through the agreements of Brest-Litovsk, but they
have been incapable to understand in what the generalization of the revolution
passed also through the as well dictatorial and violent struggle against
Economy, against Value.
<center>
<h2>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">oOo</font></h2></center>
The ascendancy from the anarchist ideology over the revolutionaries in
Ukrain, and in Russia more largely, finds its roots, as a bit everywhere
worldwide at this period anyway, in the attempt to give a coherent theoretical
substance to the will of revolutionary militants to assume direct action,
against the reformist proposals advocated by most of the social-democrat
organizations, having transformed Marxism into an ideology. This correct
will to break with reformism is going to lead a lot of these militants
to theorize their actions, under the form of more idealistic some than
others programs, going from self-management and federalist proudhonism
to examplative terrorism as catechism (see Netchaiev) in passing by anarcho-trade-unionism.
<p>Under a same flag therefore, and as well often, direct action and reformism,
revolution and counter-revolution confronted each other.
<p>Anarchism in Ukrain, as reaction to the legalistic goals of the social-democrats,
begins as in the rest of Russia at the 19th century, and becomes established
especially at the end of the century, during the famine of 1891. The first
group dates from 1903, Bor'ba (Combat). The monthly "Bread and Liberty",
from the followers of the bourgeois anarcho-trade-unionism developed by
Kropotkin, circulates then clandestinely in Ukrain.
<p>The movement reaches then Moscow and the capital Saint Petersburg, with
as important groups as "Tchernoe Znamia" (Black Flag), "Kleb i Volia" (Bread
and Liberty) and "Beznatchalie" (Without Authority). Several groups embrace
different practices: "Black Flag" acknowledges Communism as finality; "Bread
and Liberty" on the other hand, is a typical reformist group considering
"a society" where capitalism would be banished to give way to a gigantic
federation of producers directed by labour professional organizations (the
trade-unions)! And as one sees here, self-management illusions of a pure
capitalism rid of its darkest sides, gangrene the revolutionary movement
of both sides of the false polarization in which the Social-Democracy gets
enclose then "Marxists" and "anarchists". As for the militants of the third
group, "Without Authority", they practice more a literary and romantic
phraseology without hesitating to raid by throwing some bombs on all what
can represent "the so hated authority".
<p>It is within the self-defined groups as "anarchists-communists" that
the ruptures are going to be the most coherent. Against the triumphant
kropotkinian pacifism, one sees thus, the "anarchist" militants from Moscow
and Saint Petersburg, gathered around Grossmann-Rochtchin, assuming a powerful
rupture, mainly with trade-unionism. This kind of very determined rupture,
the organization of these militants around very dissociated positions,
as well as their efforts of real centralization of proletarians in struggle
are anyway most of the time, in deep contradiction with the doctrine of
reference -anarchism-, and its "anti-authoritarian" claims.
<p>The communist revolutionary militants, organized under the anarchist
flag, took part to the insurrection of October by the side of the other
avant-guard proletarian forces, by the side of the "left revolutionary
socialists", the bolsheviks, the "without parti", etc. In Ukrain, in Ekaterinoslav
for example, 80.000 proletarians run in the streets and march behind black
flags showing their participation to the current social revolution.
<p>Crushed by the Bolsheviks, at the same time that the left "revolutionary
socialists", after their armed struggle against the agreements of Brest-Litovsk,
in April 1918, these having escaped from jail or the firing squad returned
to Ukrain (historical cradle of the movement), where they found various
centralized organizations within the Nabat (the Alarm), and organized the
1st Anarchist Organizations Conference of Ukrain in November 1918.
<p>Unfortunately, this organ will play no role of centralization in the
struggle opposing the proletarians to the whole forces of reaction. As
Arshinov and Makhno will criticize it later, Nabat will be only an organization
of "theorists", "phrasors", "glib talkers" being contented more with making
propaganda "of ideas" by means of conferences, discussions, literary circles
or libraries, than taking really an active part to the revolutionary movement.
Only some, a tiny minority, will rejoin the insurrectional movement and
will take an effective part to the struggle of the proletariat.
<p>It is all this context and this history of the struggles, that constitutes
the framework in which the movement in Ukrain will be more centralized
around these "anarchist" militants than the "bolsheviks" or the "revolutionary
socialists", although these last-mentioned also enjoyed a large listening.
<p>The determining element in the organization of the Insurrectional Revolutionary
Army around the black flag, being obviously also constituted by the fact
that the "anarchist" militants -Makhno in the lead-, from their liberation
from czarist jail, returned in Ukrain to assume the tasks of agitation
and revolutionary organization.
<p>Makhno is welcomed in hero after his stay of ten years in the russian
jails. He found later the first Soviet of Peasants and Workers of Gulai-Pole,
that will decree from the end of August 1917, that is to say 3 months before
October '17, the disarmament of the bourgeoisie, as well as the "abolition
of its rights on the people".
<p>Makhno returns then to Moscow (14) to meet his comrade Arshinov, and
to consider more largely the possibilities to take part to the revolutionary
movement. After a short stay where he witnesses the repression of the anarchists
by the bolsheviks but also what he denounces as a caricature of revolution
(Moscow appears to him as "the capital of a paper revolution, a vast factory
producing resolutions and senseless slogans, while only one political party
rises by force and fraud in the position of a ruling class"), he returns
to Gulai-Pole to organize resistance on contradictory basis to those of
the bolsheviks.
<p>The bolsheviks will found as for them their activity on the more important
influence they will have within the great cities and will be from then
on almost entirely absent in the countryside. This dichotomy of the proletarian
movement will be one of the great problems the various revolutionary fractions
("bolshevik" as well as "revolutionary socialist" and "anarchist") will
not be able to solve in Russia, strengthening at the same time, the capitalistic
divisions between city and countryside maintained by the bourgeoisie.
<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">5. Against Denikin. First alliance with the
Bolsheviks (March 1919 - June 1919)</font></u></h2>
As we have seen, in a short time the Insurrectional Revolutionary Army
of Ukrain repulsed definitively the austro-german troops and their set
up ukrainian ally, Skoropadsky. Similarly, the nationalistic Petliura has
rapidly seen his social basis crumble once he started governing. In January
1919 therefore, a small year after the beginning of the uprising in Ukrain,
the various armies of bourgeoisie have been repulsed and defeated.
<p>But if in Ukrain, Makhno has managed to gather isolated bands to defeat
the remains of the austro-german troops in full rout, it goes not similarly
with the bolshevik power that is threatened from all sides. In addition
to the "sanitary cord" imposed by allied troops, the white troops equipped
and organized by the French, American and English, threaten to invade by
the east (Siberia, Koltchak's troops), by the south (Black Sea, Sea of
Azov, Crimea, Denikin's troops), and by the west (Poland, Romania and Czechoslovakia,...).
Moreover, in the north of Ukrain, the remain of Petliura's troops continues
fighting and giving the bolsheviks a lot of trouble.
<p>Denikin and his white army chooses this moment to enter in Ukrain, hoping
to progress rapidly to the north, thanks to the fact that the bolsheviks
were at grips with the Petliura's nationalists. He was quite surprised
to come across the determined and well organized army of Ukrain insurgents.
From there, the Insurrectional Army of Ukrain succeeds to organize a more
than 100 kilometres front of struggle against Denikin's Whites, nevertheless
well superior in men and material.
<p>It is also at this moment, and whereas the threat, as well from Denikin's
white armies as the petliurists, begins to be done urgent, that the Soviet
of Gulai-Pole concludes a first alliance, considered as a purely military
one, with the Bolsheviks through Dybenko and Antonov-Ovseenko, military
commander of the Ukrainian front for the Red Army.
<p>This first compromise is once more marked by the difficulty to assume
until the end the importance on no account to make a front with the enemies
of the revolution, in the circumstances here, with a Red Army, that continues
the work of reconstruction of the State in Russia, of the development of
Capital. By making prevail the defense of the Ukrainian territory (ideologically
justified by its assimilation to the defense of the revolution), the revolutionaries
of the Insurrectional Revolutionary Army are going to make the same error
than that contained in the negotiations of Brest-Litovsk: the abandonment
of the revolutionary war assumed by the proletariat in arms by the assimilation
of revolutionary energy into a "Red" Army, mechanically constituted from
the same principles than any bourgeois army (obligatory conscription, military
hierarchy and discipline, etc).
<p>This alliance materialized by a kind of inter-classist front where the
revolutionary movement tends to dilute itself in the defense of national
interests. The Insurrectional Army is incorporated in the Red Army, but
the insurgents keep nevertheless their army as well as their own discipline,
commandment, organization, etc... As we will see further on, this front
did not succeed, and the makhnovist insurgents reconquered later whole
of their autonomy.
<p>It is clear so that for Moscow, in total coherence with its policy,
the alliance with the Red Army meant the allegiance of the Revolutionary
Insurrectional Army to the bolshevik power and at the same time the crushing
of all revolutionary focus that could claim to continue the social revolution.
<p>When the insurgents of Ukrain stay stuck to this alliance, by supporting
in this front the defense of Ukrain, the revolutionary movement dilutes
itself into the defense of the armed policy of the Capital, and mark thus
the pace by a non rupture, or an inadequately clear rupture, with the bolsheviks's
bourgeois policy, considered as revolutionaries. It is only in the attempts
of ruptures, and denunciation of the bolsheviks's counter-revolutionary
character, that the revolutionary movement will regain its strongest moments.
At the opposite, it suffers only massacres, isolation and dispersion.
<p>And effectively, "war communism" the bolsheviks intend to impose does
not find any support in Ukrain. Very rapidly, the insurgent proletarians
do no longer acknowledge the bolshevik authority, newly established, from
the agreements with the Makhnovists. They are opposed to requisitions and
disperse the extraordinary commissions entrusted with the "struggle against
sabotage and counter-revolution" (Tchekas), in fact led against them. To
Kamenev, entreating him to take a stand against Grigoriev (a band chief
who turns against the Red Army -see lower down- in the province of Kherson,
west of the makhnovist army), Makhno, who confronts hardly the Denikin's
offensive, wants already to dissociate himself from the bolshevik policy
and replies:
<p>"... My troops and I will remain unshakeablely faithful to the workers
and peasants Revolution, but not to the institutions of violence, such
as your commissariats and your Tchekas that practise the arbitrary upon
the laborious population."
<p>It is in the alliance and the front (this usual tactics of bourgeoisie,
to dissolve democratically antagonical interests), that Bolsheviks, are
going to try to liquidate the makhnovist insurrectional movement, of which
they distrust and want to destroy, so as the white army. They send weapons
very sparingly, they refuse to send machine-guns and cannons, they try
to dissolve Makhno's brigade into the Red Army, they make outlaw the Military
Revolutionary Soviet that directed the activity of the makhnovist Army,
they try to assassinate Makhno, and because this sabotage is considered
as insufficient, in June, Trotsky keeps Antonov-Ovseenko (15) away from
the local commandment of the Red Army, because he was suspected of sympathies
for the Makhnovists since he had denounced these sabotage practices.
<p>In the face of all these wangles and always greater danger of white
armies busy to topple over the Red Army, the Revolutionary Military Soviet
decides to form again in an autonomous way the Revolutionary Insurrectional
Army (while communicating its displacements, and by continuing momentarily
to submit to the necessities of general strategy of the Red Army's senior
staff).
<p>But the bolshevik repression intensifies with Trotsky's arrival in Ukrain.
Antonov-Ovseenko is dismissed, the "anarchist" accused of "conspiracy against
the State" are executed, without considering the calumny campaigns led
against them. Decimated and disorganized by the bolshevik repression, without
weapons, the Makhnovists are outflanked by the white armies that take successively
Mariupol and even Gulai-Pole.
<p>Facing this terror falling on them in the very framework of the agreement
the bolsheviks had proposed to them, the Makhnovists denounce the Red State's
forces in rebuilding, while preserving to the end some illusions, about
the bolsheviks's "honesty". In this way Makhno, because he thinks naively
the bolshevik hate is led against him personally, decides to withdraw from
his commandment position in the Red Army, while leaving there the Ukrainian
combatants "prove" their combativity and their adherence to the revolution
facing Trotsky's calumnies:
<p>"In an article titled "The Makhnovchtchina" (in the newspaper "Forward",
No.55), Trotsky asks the question: "Against who makhnovist insurgents do
they uprise?" And he deals all along his article to demonstrate the Makhnovchtchina
would be in fact nothing else other than a front of battle against the
power of the Soviets. He have no word about the effective front against
the Whites, of an extent of more than one hundred kilometres where the
insurgents have suffered since six month and suffer always innumerable
losses. The order No.1824 declares I am a conspirator and an organizer
of rebellion in the way of Grigoriev. (...) This hostile attitude, and
that becomes currently aggressive, from central authorities against the
insurrectional movement leads inescapably to the creation of a particular
internal front, from both sides of which the laborious masses having faith
in the Revolution will be found. (...) The most sure means to avoid the
authorities does not commit this crime consist, in my opinion, to leave
the position I occupy."
<p>Letter from Makhno to Trotsky and the 14th Army's Senior Staff - June
9th 1919
<p>Despite the white armies's pressure, Trotsky puts a price on Makhno's
head, preferring Ukrain falls into Denikin's hands, rather than to see
the Makhnovchtchina winning a force that could turn against Bolsheviks.
<p>Makhno is then called back by the Insurrectional Revolutionary Army.
He escapes to a trap laid by the bolsheviks (trap in which several chiefs
of the Insurrectional Revolutionary Army Headquarters are going to fall,
of whom Mikhailov-Pavlenko who is executed). Makhno withdraw with a small
group of cavalrymen in the vicinity of Alexandrovsk.
<p>The white armies offensive, and the Trotsky's total disorganization
of the revolutionary forces, provokes the Red Army's rout, during this
month of July 1919. It withdraws at 300 kilometres of Moscow, abandoning
completely the proletarians of Ukrain to themselves.
<p>The situation is completely chaotic. Denikin's Whites win victory after
victory. Makhnovist insurgents receive the order from the Insurrectional
Revolutionary Army Headquarters to leave the Red Army's troops on the run,
and scatter in the countrysides. On the other hand, Grigoriev, ally of
the bolsheviks, decides to turn against the Red Army when Trotsky proposes
to this bourgeois band chief... to show internationalism towards Hungarian
proletarians while going to struggle against Romanian Army that sought
to crush them!!!
<p>This same Grigoriev is going to propose a bit later to Makhno to join
his imperialistic war against the bolsheviks. Despite all the treacheries
and treasons his army had submitted from the bolsheviks, Makhno keeps proudly
the flag of Social Revolution as the Insurrectional Revolutionary Army
combat objective: to the pact the bourgeois Grigoriev proposes him, July
27th 1919, during of a congress organized by the Makhnovists, he replies
by shooting and proclaiming well strong "the struggle against the bolsheviks
will be truly revolutionary only to the one condition it is led in the
name of Social Revolution"!
<p>Whole of units desert the bolshevik army to rejoin Makhnovists. Up to
15.000 soldiers from the Red Army, disgusted with the "tactics" of their
"Napo" Leon Trotsky (16), rejoin thus the makhnovist battalions! It is
so for example with several bolshevik battalions from Crimea, led by the
makhnovist chiefs Kalachnikov, Dermendji and Budanov. Other important detachments
of the Red Army from Novo Bug, dismissed their chiefs and went in search
of Makhno's scattered and disorganized army. The junction of these troops
was made in August 1919, at Dobrovelitchkovka. The Insurrectional Revolutionary
Army dispersed combatants converged in large numbers in this district near
Odessa. At this moment only the army could restructure itself, around almost
15.000 combatants, formed into four infantry and cavalry brigades, an artillery
division and a regiment of machine-guns.
<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">6. The victorious Insurrectional Army (September
1919). Revolutionary terror and social organization attempts.</font></u></h2>
The divorce with the Bolsheviks seemed total and definitive. To bolshevik
responsibles who ask Makhno again to struggle together, under the red officers
commandment, he replies:
<p>"You have deceived Ukrain (sic!!) and, more serious, you have executed
my comrades in Gulai-Pole; your units will go over to my side anyway, then
I will proceed with you all, the responsibles, in the same way you have
proceeded with my comrades."
<p>If it is clear the movement remains dominated by great weaknesses, -the
defense of Ukrain at all costs-, the revolutionary movement begins to determine
more clearly its enemies and to denounce them as such. The Insurrectional
Revolutionary Army turns from then on its weapons as well against Denikin's
whites as against the bolsheviks.
<p>Facing the Red Army's complete rout, and the makhnovist army disorganization
following upon the front with the bolshevik militaries, the white fraction
of bourgeoisie has resettled in Ukrain, with Denikin's help. Repression
against proletariat intensifies, with its procession of lootings, massacres,
rapes. Men, women, children rejoin the Insurrectional Revolutionary Army
on the perpetual run, pursued without a break by the white armies. It is
a gigantic caravan of some one hundred twenty thousands of people stretching
on nearly 40 kilometres long, and resisting somehow to the various fractions
of the bourgeoisie attacks during more than 600 kilometres.
<p>From a last victorious burst, at Peregonovka (near Uman) September the
25-26th 1919, the Insurrectional Revolutionary Army reverses the situation
in ten days. Defeating Denikin's backs, it liberates at the same time Moscow
from the white armies's growing hold (17). Indeed, Denikin, underestimating
the Makhnovists, had thrown the bulk of his troops on Moscow. Cut of his
back bases, his means of communication, his supply, Denikin's army suffers
a real rout. We must see in this rout, the real starting point of the defeat
the White Army will suffer in Russia, contrary to the legend of the Red
Army victory, thanks to Trotsky's "military science"
(18).
<p>Sweeping away the white army, that had engaged a last repression, as
a result of the Peregonovka revolutionaries's victory, liberating the cities
from the bourgeois hold, the Makhnovists annihilate thus in autumn 1919
Denikin's counter-revolution by applying a real revolutionary terror:
<p>"The landowners, the big farmers, policemen, priests, mayors, shirked
officers,... whole was swept away on the Makhnovchtchina's victorious path.
Jails and police stations, in brief, all the symbols of the popular servitude
were destroyed. All these one known to be active enemies of peasants and
workers were doomed to death. Especially the big landowners and the big
farmers exploiters of the people, the "kulaks", perished then in great
number."
<p>Arshinov in "History of the makhnovist movement" - 1921
<p>The Makhnovists, drawing the lessons, refuse the proposition of the
coming back Bolsheviks to share the power -in fact the disarmament of the
proletariat!- with them: the army to the "Red" bourgeois, and the administration
and charge of the cities to the Makhnovists.
<p>They are going to try self-organizing (banks are emptied, one organizes
"Free Communes", etc, -cf. above), but it is a failure. Their no rupture
with "anarchist" Social-Democracy, their self-managementism and federalism,
their refusal to put themselves really at the head of the <b>open</b> struggle
against the red repainted State, but also the gigantic granted war effort
(the army is decimated by the typhus), whole of that, and also the refusal
to generalize the struggle beyond southern of Ukrain, is going to lead
right to the disaster.
<p>Thus, in the cities, during this short period in October and November
1919 where the Insurrectional Army of Ukrain was in control of Alexandrovsk
and especially Ekaterinoslav, <b>the anti-authoritarian ideology broke
from all its contradictions.</b> Forgetting the right methods by which
they had, authoritatively, led the class war facing the various bourgeois
armies, the Makhnovists decreed now democratically the total freedom of
press and association, and the possibility to get reorganized therefore,
for all the pseudo-socialists who tried to strangle revolution by all means:
<p>"1. All the parties, organizations and socialist political currents
have the right to propagate freely their ideas, theories, viewpoints and
opinions, orally as well as in writing. No restriction of the liberty of
the socialists, the Press and the expression will be admitted, and they
will not be the subject of prosecutions for that."
<p>"Revolutionary Military Council of Makhnovist Guerrillas, Ekaterinoslav,
November the 5th 1919."
<p>But on the other hand, perceiving confusingly the absurdity contained
in the fact to exert red terror on the battlefields, and not on the economical,
ideological and political ground, the Makhnovists, "forgave all parties
to impose any political authority against the worker masses", going even
to execute those infringing this rule (19)!!!
<p>The Red Army benefited by this moment of disarray in the "how to continue
the struggle", in order to come resettling itself in the region, bringing
with a new white repression. Counter-revolution triumphs once again: facing
the Insurrectional Revolutionary Army leaders's criminal inconsistencies,
bogged down into the imbecile anti-authoritarian and anti-substitutionist
ideology, the bolshevik rectifiers of State have all the time to reconquer
the insurgent regions of Ukrain, by imposing their program, as early as
January 1920.
<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">7. Nine month of new "Red" repression</font></u></h2>
Weaken, at all viewpoints, the Makhnovists leave then the Red Army to occupy
the ground deluding themselves once again on the latter by considering
it as the last possibility to get rid definitively of Denikin, by preventing
his return.
<p>In fact, the Makhnovists can not manage to break with their tendency
to come closer to Bolsheviks. They see in them only bad worker leaders
and not the bourgeois State taking back in their hands the reorganization
of Capital. Moreover, by refusing to assume the revolutionary directorship
role, they organize proletarians... to withdraw afterwards, by advocating
self- organization!!! They leave them thus isolated and vulnerable facing
the bolshevik repression.
<p>Some long discussions had brought the insurgents to these criminal conclusions.
Revolution and counter-revolution have effectively confronted within the
Insurrectional Revolutionary Army, as we noted at the beginning of this
text. Indeed, a part of the forces considered to be necessary to continue
the revolutionary war by advocating, during the struggles led against Denikin,
the generalization of the movement. They argued correctly the situation
by describing the revolutionary state of mind not only of the region, but
whole of the proletariat in Russia, ready for accomplishing what they called
the "Third Social Revolution" (20).
<p>And indeed, during this war against Denikin, many detachments of insurgents
rallied to the Makhnovists, considering spontaneously in there the directorship
of a force ready for submerging difficulties, and the knocks struck to
the revolution by the various bourgeois social forces. Some detachments
of the Red Army flocked even from Central Russia to join the Makhnovchtchina's
flag: this was the case of the very numerous bolshevik troops, commanded
by Ogarkov, for example, coming from the government of Orel, to struggle
for the social revolution, by the sides of the proletarian insurgents of
Ukrain.
<p>And besides the rallies in large numbers of proletarians of the region,
many other organized forces of the revolution rejoined the Insurrectional
Revolutionary Army. Besides some ex-"Bolsheviks", "Left Socialists-Revolutionaries"
joined the "anarchists-communists", like Victor Popov, this ex-sailor of
the Black Sea who had led the uprising of the "Left Socialists- Revolutionaries",
against the Bolsheviks, in July 1918.
<p>But all these favourable forces to the generalization of the revolutionary
war were, like in Brest-Litovsk, defeated by a majority of glib talkers
like Volin, who advocated the positive construction of "anarchist" federated
communes, inviting the revolutionaries to withdraw in the "liberated" regions
around Gulai-Pole, their bastion, and dropping thus literally all a part
of the proletariat to repression and terror imposed by the bolshevik agents
of the capitalistic reconstruction in Russia.
<p>Social-democratic anarchist version ideology of the non directorship
will make easier thus the repressive campaign of the Bolsheviks during
nine months. Everywhere the Red Army occupies the ground clear by the Makhnovists
to found there the authority of Capital. Jails are reconstructed and filled,
police and Tcheka arrest and execute the revolutionaries, as well as all
these who are susceptible to help the Makhnovists accused to be "traitors
to the Ukrainian people".
<p>It is the beginning of the "civil war" between Bolsheviks and Makhnovists.
To avoid fraternizations between the Red Army and the latter, the Bolsheviks
send to take part to the repression estonian, letton and chinese soldiers
(what does not prevent some fraternizations and desertions). It is a real
slaughter, the lowest estimations speak about 200.000 deads and so much
deported in Siberia only during the year 1920. The year 1920, marked by
"war communism", strengthens thus the hate against the Bolsheviks. These
are only cattle and crops requisitions, entailing the famine, in what one
calls nevertheless the "wheat granary of Europe". In spite of that, the
Red Army suffers still reverses facing proletarians in arms who lead, once
more, a guerrilla without mercy against those who want to perpetuate their
situation to be exploited.
<p>During several months, the struggle is relentless between the Bolsheviks
and the Makhnovists, and without mercy on both sides. Nevertheless, the
methods of combat are fundamentally different. The Red Army proceeds like
any called "occupation" bourgeois army: it executes massively and indifferently
in the villages, knowing it is mainly there the Makhnovists find a basis.
And when "anarchists-communists" are arrested, they are immediately executed
-apart from their place in the Insurrectiional Revolutionary Army- or thrown
into jails, submitted to tortures and blackmails, to oblige them to renounce
their adherence to the makhnovist movement, or to make them giving informations
or to be used to serve as double agent.
<p>For the makhnovist side, the proletarian and revolutionary war remains
the means of struggle against the enemy armies, as they made already at
the time of the austro-german occupation. The bolshevik responsibles and
other "red" officers are executed without pity, while soldiers have the
choice between rejoining the insurgents's army or coming back home disarmed.
They advocate also the defeat of the enemy army by means of pamphlets and
other materials of defeatist propaganda:
<p>"Brothers red soldiers! (...)
<br>Now, one sends you again to combat us, we the 'makhnovist insurgents',
in the name of a so-called 'worker-peasant' power, that brings you again
chains and slavery! Wealth and joys go to this gang of bureaucrats-parasites
that suck your blood (...).
<br>Are you going again shedding your blood for the newly blossomed bourgeoisie
and for the commissioners it created, and that send you, as livestock,
to the slaughter! Did you not have still understood that we, 'makhnovist
insurgents', we combat for the political and economical workers' complete
emancipation, for a free life without these commissioners and other agents
of the repression? (...)
<br>Each time you meet us, so as to avoid to cause fraternal bloodshed,
send us some delegates to negotiate, but if it is not possible for you
and that commissioners oblige you nevertheless to combat us, throw your
guns and come to our fraternal encounter.
<br>Down with the fratricide war between workers!
<br>Long live peace and fraternal union of workers from all countries and
all nations!"
<p>"Down with the fratricide combat!", pamphlet from the makhnovist insurgents
- May 1920
<p>The revolutionaries' calls had sometimes spectacular results upon soldiers
of the Red Army. Here is an extract from the Call launched by the soldiers
from the 522nd regiment of the Red Army, when they decided to desert and
to rejoin the Insurrectional Revolutionary Army:
<p>"We, Red soldiers from the 522nd regiment, we are gone over June the
25th 1920, without any gunshot and with all our equipment and our weapons
to the Makhnovist insurgents' side. The communists have pestered us and
have attributed our passing to the Makhnovist insurgents' side to an anger
and a tendency to banditry. Whole that is only a low and coward lie from
the commissioners who used us up till then as cannon fodder. During our
two years service within the Red Army, we came to the conclusion that the
whole social regime of our lives is based only on the domination of the
commissioners and that it will bring us at the end to a slavery never seen
before in the history (...).
<p>"The Red soldiers of the 522nd regiment, today Makhnovists"
<p>Facing the growing defeatism of the Red Army's soldiers, and to reply
to the Makhnovists's revolutionary methods, the "red" generals installed
commissions specially instructed to recuperate the soldiers released by
the Insurrectional Revolutionary Army, and to enrol them again in other
units.
<p>The resistance of the insurgents's army encounters some success facing
the Bolsheviks, during all the beginning of this year 1920, but a new threat
appears to the horizon under the form of the white armies reorganized under
the authority of general Wrangel.
<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">8. The new white offensive (April 1920),
the defeat (November 1920) and the exile (August 1921)</font></u></h2>
Wrangel takes the head of the white army and his success, strengthened
by the extreme weakness of the Red Army (defeated by Pilsudsky's army in
front of Warsaw), urges this last -the Red Army- to ask once more the alliance
with the Makhnovists.
<p>These for their part, decimated by the bolshevik repression, exhausted
by the war they fought against them, as well as by their resistance to
the successive white offensives, also isolated by the calumnies spread
by the Bolsheviks about a so-called alliance of Makhno with Wrangel, the
Makhnovists therefore, reach the breaking point during the Summer of 1920
under the pressure of Wrangel's offensive, with which Polish army and Petliura's
Ukrainian nationalists become associated in the north.
<p>From then on, they sign a new military and political agreement with
the Red Army some months later, in October 1920 (21).
<p>The "anarchists-communists"'s army gives up on behalf of the same logic
of "lesser pain" that had animated them during the first alliance: rather
the alliance with the soviet State than the death with the Whites.
<p>Thus the all recent lessons and experience are not assumed. The decision
to collaborate once again with its enemies corresponds with a real suicide.
Remains of the revolutionary movement are thus quickly found destroyed
as well morally as physically. Indeed, in the framework of this alliance,
refusing any rest to the insurgents, the Bolsheviks send them continually
in front line, first to eliminate them while retreating the Whites, then
to better control them (back they could lead their subversive propaganda
within the Red Army)
(22).
<p>The Makhnovists get little by little decimated, notably because their
units composed of revolutionaries, known for their combativity, do not
retreat in front of losses. And the Bolsheviks's four stars generals know
that! So for example, they send them in a 10 kilometres unprotected charge
in an Isthmus of Crimea, giving them a chance on one hundred of success.
They achieve there and get the victory, but at the cost of huge human losses.
Whites are beaten, but the makhnovist's movement ends exsanguinous.
<p>The Russian State turns then against the Makhnovists, and mid-November
1920, the Bolsheviks attack by surprise makhnovists' Headquarters and troops
in Crimea. At the same time, they seize makhnovist representatives of Kharkov,
attack the "anarchists-communists" of Gulai-Pole, and destroy their organizations
everywhere in Ukrain.
<p>A bit later, liberated from the pressure of Wrangel's armies, repulsed
outside Russia, the Red Army can devote itself to defeat definitively the
Makhnovists. With an infinitely superior in numbers army, it needs nevertheless
more than six months to beat the Makhnovists.
<p>The situation was particularly perilous for the Bolsheviks in early
1921. In Petrograd, big strikes broke out and in Cronstadt, the proletariat
rose up. During this period, many armies of organized proletarians tried
to struggle through all Russia against reconstruction of the State by the
Bolsheviks. In Tambov, the "socialist-revolutionary" Antonov organizes
an army of 50.000 men. 60.000 proletarians rise up in a district of western
Siberia. In Carelia, in central Asia, in the Caucasus,... one asks the
new Kremlin masters for an explanation. This "small civil war" as the soviet
historians named it, made nearly 200.000 deaths.
<p>Also at this moment the Makhnovists' revolutionary defeatist propaganda
finds still many echoes. Thus the 9th February 1921, 1st brigade of the
4th division of the "Red" cavalry rejoins a makhnovist detachment near
Pavlograd. And it is at this same time the Makhnovists tried really to
generalize the revolution. Brova and Maslakov go away in the Don and Kouban
region; Parkhomenko takes away a detachment in the Voronej region, in Russia;
a third group of a thousand of insurgents makes one's way towards Kharkov,
with at its head another makhnovist combatant, Ivaniuk.
<p>But it is unfortunately too late. The proletariat is getting beaten
everywhere it has uprisen. A period of white terror begins then, as each
time the revolution is defeated, through all Russia, but particularly in
this insurgent region of Ukrain.
<p>The Red Army passes systematically through each of the villages and
cities of the region, and exterminates there all of these suspected of
any sympathy towards the makhnovist movement.
<p>Separated from any revolutionary movement, during the Summer of 1921,
the last nuclei gathered around Makhno, are cornered and brought to run
away in Romania, where they disperse definitively.

This article aims to translate into lessons the general teachings of this
proletarian attempt to assume the revolution, as alternative to the reorganization
of the State by the Bolsheviks. In such an article, it is difficult to
render the combativity that has animated these militants of our class,
these real avant-garde fighters in struggle to impose <u>communism</u>.
<p>To have a more complete and precise idea of that, we can only refer
comrades to the works describing at length the smallest details of this
fierce struggle of more than three years against Skoropadsky's, Petliura's,
Grigoriev's, Denikin's, Dybenko's, Trotsky's, Wrangel's, etc. armies. Independently
of the weaknesses and illusions of their authors, the stories of the revolutionary
fighters themselves, -those of Makhno and Arshinov-, have left us an amount
of crude materials that restores the level of combativity and intensity
of this tremendous communist wave that has broken between 1917 and 1923
upon the world.
<p>As one will see by reading these documents, the communist movement in
Ukrain is absolutely not reducible to Makhno's personality. We have resituated
in this text, the context in which this "anarchist-communist" militant
succeeded to crystallize the revolutionary direction, at the same time
that he passes on to it his own programmatical weaknesses. But it is important
to resituate his own combativity (23), in the framework of the generalized
will to fight it out with the State of thousands of unknown proletarians.
<p>Quote simply here finally, some of the other historical leaders who
were at the avant-garde of the insurrection in Ukrain: Simon Karetnik,
Martchenko, Gregoir Vassilevsky, Veretelnikov, Pierre Gavrilenko, Basil
Korilenko, Victor Belach, Vdovitchenko, Zonov, Kalachnikov, Mikhalev Pavlenko,
Makecv, Basil Danilov, Tchernoknijny, Stchuss, Isidor Luty, Thomas Kojin,
Lepetchenko, Sereguin,... Most of these fighters, listed by Arshinov at
the end of his book about insurrection in Ukrain, were "anarchist-communist"
militants, having prolonged their years of militancy by their consequent
presence to the leading functions of the insurrection in Ukrain. Only,
one or the other survived to the various battles led facing the bourgeois
armies.
<p>These of the Makhnovists who survived to the several battles and escaped
the terrible stalinist repression, started against the revolution, left
in exile.
<center>
<h2>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">oOo</font></h2></center>
It is to note that Arshinov and Makhno tried to organize the revolutionary
movement around an "organizational Platform" (24) published in Paris, in
October 1926, in the "Dielo Truda" newspaper (The Cause of Work), on behalf
of the Abroad Russian Anarchist Communist Group (GARE in french), of which
they are the main organizers. Their will is to assume a rupture with the
ambient anti-organizationalism, and to gathered "anarchist-communist" militants
around this project. The "organizational Platform" is the result of discussions
and debates led by these militants since 1925 (date they could gather in
Paris) around the lessons and perspectives to draw, from the failure of
the revolutionary struggles they have participated to in Ukrain, in Russia
and in the world, during these years '17-'23. The publication of the "Platform"
was followed by a real will to break with the social-democrat program organized
around the flag of anarchy and raised a general outcry from all the partisans
of ideological anarchism.
<p>That is the way these same Russian militants linked together with other
comrades of exile in France, and tried to set up an international opposition
to break with this "anarchist family milieu". They organized for that purpose,
an international meeting in March 1927, preceded by a preliminary meeting
a month earlier. The content of rupture and the efforts of programatical
clarification these comrades intended to realize, -at the moment where
the communist movement collapsed a bit everywhere in the world-, were undeniable.
Arshinov insisted on the necessity to "seek to organize revolutionary forces
working in the worker avant-garde... by creating an homogeneous movement
based on the principle of the collective responsibility and acting within
the national and international organization"; it is necessary, he says,
"to make a selection of forces" by no longer recognizing neither anarcho-syndicalism,
nor individualism as currents linked to the movement. French militants
(Od&eacute;on, Dauphin-Meunier,...), Spanish (Carbo, Fernandez,...), Italian
(Ugo Fedeli, who presided the preliminary meeting), Polish (Ranko), Chinese
(Cen),... marked their agreement to organize an International Union on
basis of the rupture with "anarchist" democratism. "Our goal is to gather
all the militants of our tendency and to struggle against the Anarchist
Sacred-Union." (Ranko)
<p>The international meeting was the place of sharp discussions between
its participants, but a clarification began to carry out. The meeting was
interrupted by the arrival of the police.
<p>The discussion between "platformists" and "anti-platformists" polarized
during all this time all kind of organizations, provoking many splits more
or less clarifying. Under way, the organizers of the meeting assumed some
continuity to their proposal, then, completely exhausted by the international
repression, by the proletarian struggles decline, by their own weaknesses
and by the insults conveys against them by the followers of ideological
anarchism, the initiative disappeared in the long night of counter-revolution.
<p>Well obviously, the same glib talkers of lounge and ideology anarchism
denounced this project from the beginning, going until to call the "Platform"
and its main author, Arshinov, as... "bolshevik", he who had fought with
guns in his hands against the "Red" Army, by the sides of Makhno, during
nearly 4 years!!! The "anarchists" of literature as Volin, Nettlau,...
played the same slanderous role towards the "anarchist-communist" revolutionary
militants as their stalinist enemy brothers against the "communist lefts"!
Whole that brought Makhno and Arshinov to break with Volin, S&eacute;bastien
Faure and other democrats disguised in revolutionary. With the help of
counter-revolution, and completely disgusted by his former anarchist friends,
Arshinov returned in Russia, recognizing for that reason the stalinist
power, what allowed to his former friends to confirm he was really mistaken
with his "organizational Platform"!
<p>Makhno as for him, remembered until the end the lesson about organization
he had drawn in the very heat of class struggle, and so he declares on
the occasion of a meeting with "expropriator anarchists" Ascaso, Durutti
and Jover:
<p><b>"It is the organization that ensures the triumph in depth of each
revolution"!!!</b>
<p>May all of these who would want to transform Makhno into an inoffensive
icon, meditate this sentence... or cease to claim vainly the Makhnovchtchina!
<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">9. Forces and weaknesses!</font></u></h2>
During all this worldwide revolutionary wave, from more or less 1916 to
early twenties, the focuses have often moved about, coexisting sometimes
in several places. And while it is often recognized that in 1917, the main
revolutionary focus spread to the Russian Empire and that the more burning
embers consumed Moscow and Saint-Petersburg, other centres of the Revolution
are born, often denied, hidden, forgotten, disfigured voluntarily by counter-revolution.
<p>And even when revolutionary movements are recognized and glorified,
they are only in so far as their subversive aspects are curtailed, falsified,
defused. By imposing its ideology, bourgeoisie recognizes the proletarian
revolution in Russia (it could not hide it so its effect was universal!)
only by misrepresenting it totally and by establishing a formal and direct
filiation between the communist movement and the capitalistic State painted
in red by the Bolsheviks.
<p>On the other hand, the bourgeois will conceal until the excessive falsification,
the movements judged explosive to reduce the class struggle to an individual
conflict to "the power". Proletarian insurrections and attempts of destruction
of the State become "putsches", by bringing out unilaterally a network
of facts strayed from their globality.
<p>One of the methods used to manage to empty a revolutionary movement
from its content is to make appearing these class movements as so much
acts from "brilliant" or "barbarian" individuals: history shows men to
hide better the antagonism between revolution and counter-revolution. The
insurrection in Ukrain is not an exception to the rule.
<p>Reduced to the only personality of Makhno, it is misrepresented, so
by the Bolsheviks who look upon the proletarians in struggle against their
power as a gang "of anarcho-bandits, counter-revolutionaries", indeed of
"anti-semites" (25); than by the "anarchist" apologues of Makhno seeing
him as the "saviour of the social revolution". The ideological anarchism
salutes as much better Makhno today than it called him still yesterday
in his Parisian exile, "an anarcho-bolshevik", as we have briefly reminded
above.
<p>Indeed, when him and other "anarchists-communists" (Russian, Italian,
French, Spanish) evoked the necessity to lead the movement, the necessity
to ask the question of "the anarchist organization", not in itself but
as a necessity resulting in the lessons drawn from the Ukrainian insurrection
(cf. above: The Platform of the Abroad Russian Anarchist Communist Group
(GARE) 1926), it is by an outcry and a general banishing the ideological
anarchism reacts.
<p>Beyond even therefore the personality of Makhno, so brilliant military
strategist and clear-sighted he was, a situation appeared, as usual, well
more complex, more contradictory. Beyond these who have personalized it,
a movement is asserting, authentically proletarian, with its forces and
its weaknesses.
<p>The great force of the Makhnovchtchina comes from it has been capable
to centralize, to organize the proletarians in struggle, so against White
armies, than against the "Red" armies. It is necessary once again to insist
here, beyond the scholastic debate between "Marxists" and "anarchists",
that this centralization of the proletarian forces gathered revolutionary
forces as various as "Bolsheviks", whose one, Novitsky, was even elected
member of the Military Revolutionary Soviet in October 1919, "left socialists-revolutionaries"
such as Victor Popov or Veretelnikov, "without party" revolutionaries such
as Kojin and many others, "anarchists-communists", and a lot of other proletarians
from very various militant origins, sign if necessary that the Makhnovchtchina
was the real expression of an organization in force, gathering militants
determined to give the final assault to the State.
<p>This organization, it is the centralization of the struggle of proletarians
against the bourgeoisie. To the arming, the discipline and the rigor of
the bourgeois army will answer for the insurgents of Ukrain, the enthusiasm
and the revolutionary fervour.
<p>This enthusiasm will be alone able to compensate the lack of weapons
and military rigor: about an army from until one hundred thousand men,
only thirty thousand were armed, the others intervening sometimes with
clubs and pitchforks! Just even when the Red guards in Russia exposed to
the bolshevik repression were dissolved, and when, gradually disorganized
and disarmed, they were replaced by the Red Army, restructured thanks to
the former officers of the czarist army and under the leadership of "comrade"
Trotsky, the composition of the Insurrectional Revolutionary Army of the
Ukrainian proletarians sounded as a cutting and alive denial to assertions
of bolshevik chiefs, about the impossibility to organize a proletarian
army otherwise than by using the bourgeois methods and officers.
<p>The forced mobilization (on pain on death) and the reinstitution of
the bourgeois discipline faked under a "revolutionary" word for the circumstance,
constituted the bourgeois basis of the foundation of the Red Army, just
as young revolutionary militants, without any military experience, organized
an army of proletarians from the cities and the countrysides that, <b>without
hierarchy, without bourgeois officers, and with its own discipline of class,
<u>was
going to give each of the innumerable "red" or white armies it was going
to confront a good hiding</u></b>! It is the most beautiful lesson the
proletariat at arms of this period leaves us as for the necessity to destroy
from top to bottom the bourgeois army, its rules, its methods, its content,
its discipline and its chiefs, during the revolution.
<center>
<h2>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">oOo</font></h2></center>
We have also insisted on weaknesses of the movement, all along this text.
They can be briefly reminded and summarized here: lack of clear direction
as for the finality of the movement, what led to the substitution of the
dictatorship of the proletariat upon the value to a glorification of management
and self-management of the capitalist exploitation; lack of centralization,
even if in the facts their practice contradicted often their ideology of
reference, federalism; lack of generalization of the revolution; anti-substitutionism
leading the Makhnovists to leave the "masses" to take care assuming the
dictatorship of the proletariat, real resignation of the direction of the
movement; frontism through the successive alliances with the bolshevik
State painted in red; anti-authoritarism and refusal of the "power"...
<p>Nevertheless the insurrection in Ukrain testifies many a respect, the
existence of the class struggle against the bourgeois State, that through
the reorganization of capital by the militarization of the economy (or
"communism of war") had for function to liquidate physically the revolutionaries.
<p>The interest and the forces of the movement organized around the Insurrectional
Revolutionary Army come from that their revolutionary practice has often
exceeded -when it was not its pure negation!-, their theoretical idea:
<p>- thus, their anti-statism of principle is continually denied by their
practice of installation the elements of a proletarian State, aiming to
institute the red terror, and to organize the expropriations, as well as
the social production. Even if this are attempts that fail because of the
repression and the general power struggle between the classes, or also
because of the limits (practical, and also ideological) as themselves required.
<p>- similarly, their anti-organizationalism, as well as their refusal
to submit to the least authority, are in fact denied. Their army is the
flagrant proof. Not only it is very organized and well-disciplined, but
besides it is subordinated to the Military Revolutionary Soviet, that is
in fact the central organ of the several regional congresses. We see therefore
there also an embryo of proletarian power.
<p>But also once here, the <b>revolutionary practice</b> remains decisive
<b>as
long as it confronts in fact</b> and exceeds the contradictions present
in its watchwords and its flags; on the other hand, when it is necessary
to go more forwards in the affirmation of the real communist project, and
the theories that confuse it with the democratic occupation in the existing
order - managerism and anti-authoritarism here - are not exceeded, then,
<b>these
same flags assert violently as a practical barrier that, seizing the masses,
<u>transforms
into a counter-revolutionary force</u> and curbs physically the development
of our movement!!!</b>
<p>We find this process unfortunately many times all along the combats
organized under the flag of anarchy, and this sometimes until the absurd.
The
"anarchists" like Volin have given more than once a solid caricature.
<p>Thus, in October 1920, while delegations of several units of the Red
Army came in Kharkov where Volin and Nabat's militants were gathered, to
propose them to "take the power" and to arrest themselves the central committee
of the local bolshevik party that had just executed the Makhnovists, these
- the Nabat's "anarchists" - refused to aassume any direction by declaring
brandly that the masses had to act for their own part and that "anarchists"
did not want the "power"! Misery of Democracy and anti-authoritarism! It's
a shame that the violent break from some Makhnovists with Volin in 1926,
was not materialized by bullets some years earlier on the occasion of this
criminal and imbecile irresponsibility.
<p>Another big limit of the movement was the difficulty to extend the revolution.
The same question as in Brest-Litovsk was asked to the militants of the
"Third Social Revolution". The Makhnovists will try in concrete terms to
extend the revolutionary movement of which they were one of the centres
within the worldwide wave that surges at the time, but they made it only
much too late, on the eve of the defeat of their movement. This is only
in 1921 they will come into contact with other fractions of the revolutionary
movement, and particularly in Cronstadt, Kiev, Moscow and on the other
side of Ural. They proposed them a "collaboration" facing the red State
"that had betrayed workers and peasants".
<p>But the myth of the Bolsheviks and their "revolutionary State" was at
the time so powerful that even for revolutionaries as consequent as the
insurgents of Ukrain or Cronstadt, the <b>rupture</b> could not be made
so brutally. The illusion to be able voluntarily to return the tendency
towards the revolution acted to full capacity its counter-revolutionary
role. The Bolsheviks, with Lenin at their head, could on no account symbolize
for them the complete counter-revolution on the move. The weight - because
it concerns well a weight here! - of the memories of October 1917, and
the Bolsheviks' image who were a part of the avant-garde, were so that
very few were these who perceived and struggled in an intransigent and
consequent way, against the Bolsheviks, as agents freshly co-opted for
the reconstruction of the bourgeois State in Russia (26).
<p>The almost mystical Makhnovists' withdrawal on Ukrain had for function,
not to maintain a revolutionary "focus" facing a State symbolizing practically
the active counter-revolution, but whole on the contrary to allow to Capital
to isolate them and defeat the "focuses" some after the others, parcel
by parcel.
<p>But if it is true that the great weakness of the insurgents in Ukrain
was their federalism, their objective incapacity (but also it seems, their
subjective will) to (not) extend the movement right from the start beyond
Ukrain, the fact is that revolutionary defeatism on basis of which they
fought, contained the internationalist dimension of the struggle against
all homelands from all these who have confronted, at a moment or another
of the history, the imbecile persecutions from the world of exploitation:
<p>"The exploited of all nationalities, whether they are Russians, Polishes,
Lettons, Armenians, Jews or Germans, have to unite in a great workers and
peasants community in solidarity, then by a powerful attack, carry the
last decisive knock to the class of capitalists, imperialists and their
servants, so as to get definitively rid of the chains of the economic slavery
and the spiritual enslavement.
<p>Down with Capital and power!
<br>Down with religious prejudices and national hate!
<br>Long live the Social Revolution!"

<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">Notes</font></u></h3>
1. We draw the attention of the reader notably on all the idiotic things
distilled by the various schools of social-democracy finding in these events
the justification of their counterrevolutionary positions. As an example,
the traumatism of some cockroaches has remained blocked to the subjective
role of the bolshevik party seen as the monolithic and unique actor of
the Russian revolution while it has always been crossed by currents in
total opposition (as the Miasnikov's Worker Group) and that often, it was
in tow of the real revolutionary movement materializing itself to quite
different levels. It is similar with the pitiful subtleties developed about
an opposition between a "peasant" Russia not having been ahead of the feudalism
stage and an "industrial-capitalist-modern" Germany with a strong proletariat
but "unfortunately without a party of the same kind than the Russian Worker
Social Democrat Party", hence the much more idiotic conclusion drawn from
it: "bolshevik parties everywhere!". To the other end, the Russian revolution
having seen the bolshevik party found itself as relentless defender of
capitalism, the solution advocated by councilists and other anarchists
is summarized to advocate the "liberty of opinion of the proletarians",
the refusal of all organization and the worker parliamentarianism seen
as the universal panacea to their pacifist refusal of the revolutionary
violence, of the necessary organization of the former to put an end to
the hell that we daily suffer.
<p>2. See our text "Totality" in the same issue.
<p>3. From Petliura, the leader of that movement.
<p>4. we will describe further and briefly the origins and the reasons
why the "anarchists" were so influential in Ukraine.
<p>5. It would be good about this that the "anarchists" of ideologies,
these libertarians turned to their navel, these free-examinist and inconsistent
individualists, -violently denounced by Makhno and Arshinov, anyway!-,
break once and for all with their opportunism from after the battle and
are consequent with themselves by denouncing the terrible dictator who
was Makhno, by revealing the red terror that he has led, by giving away
also the terrible name of the program he defended: communism! For all these
worthy libertarian intellectuals praising Makhno only for his struggle
against the Bolsheviks, pining the old Nestor's picture to their sad reformist
ideologies, it is trying to make from him the armed arm of their democratic
project! Therefore, they make to Makhno, what the stalinists have made
to Marx, by hanging this last to the walls of their bourgeois ideologies
painted in red!
<p>6. Arshinov is not any kind of Makhno's travelling companion. He formed
him politically while he was still in jail some years before. Arshinov
is a communist militant (he will prefer to say "anarchist-communist") who
continued all his life struggling to give an organization to the struggles,
to the revolutionaries. For this reason, he was criticized of "anarcho-bolshevist"
from large parisian "anarchists" circles, sad equivalent of the kropotkinian
intellectuals in Russia, denounced by Makhno as pedant indifferentists.
<p>7. Revolutionaries, from any kind of side they are, organize themselves
instinctively around the strongest revolutionary fraction, that really
manages, centralizing the revolutionary activity. Thus the detachment of
bolshevik partisans known under the name of "Kolossov's detachment" (from
the name of its commander) will act often together with the makhnovist's
detachments in their struggle against the austro-german troops. It is exactly
the same revolutionary practice when the Makhno's detachment came closer
to the small village of Nijne-Dnieprovsk (near Ekaterinoslav) where the
bolshevik tendency committee of the city handed over the commandment of
the worker detachment as well as that of the party into his hands!
<p>8. The suffix "vchtchina" has a derogatory connotation and was attributed
by the bourgeois ("red" and white) to the Insurrectional Army of Ukrain
to "criminalize" it, to reduce it to a "association of criminals", but
proletarians reappropriated positively this expression and claimed it.
One rediscovers this same attempt of negation of the political content
of these who confront to the State, in the media's favourite expression
to describe proletarians in revolt: the "gang" (see the "Baader's Gang"
for the german "Red Army Fraction", or also, the "Bonnot's Gang" for these
expropriator "anarchists" early in the century in France, etc...).
<p>9. It is important to note that this denomination of anarchist-communist
is the own denomination of the makhnovist militants. Arshinov uses it abundantly
in his book about the insurrection in Ukrain, in order to dissociate himself
from the lounge "anarchists", these theorists generally fundamentally anti-communist,
and of whom the democratic and free will roamings have nothing more to
do with the communist movement than the democratic centralism of their
stalinist enemy brother.
<p>10. For a more deep critic of this conception, we refer the reader to
the magnificent critic of the proudhonnism by Marx in "Misery of the philosophy",
as well as our critics of self-management in <i>Le Communiste</i> No.28
in french: "The social-democrat conception of transition to socialism".
<p>11. We say "confusingly", because the State management by the Bolsheviks
has nothing modified in the deep nature of the production relations, as
Arshinov presents it; it did nothing but perpetuate under another form
the exploitation of the proletariat by the bourgeoisie. Similarly, capitalism
under the bolshevik policy has perpetuated itself under its same essential
characteristics; describing the stalinist management as "State capitalist",
it is, besides the confused pleonasm containing by this expression, opening
the door to all these leftist separations trying to justify us such or
such detail difference, to bring us considering on basis of pseudo-objective
nuances a differentiated support according to the "capitalisms".
<p>12. We let here the continuation of the quotation, the exemplification
Arshinov makes of it:
<p>"Let's quote an example. To the month of August 1918, workers of the
ancient manufacture of Prokhorov, to Moscow, shook and threaten to revolt
against the insufficiency of salaries and the detective regime established
to the manufacture. They organized in the even manufactures several meetings,
hunted the committee of factory (that was only a cell of the party) and
took for salary a part of what they had produced. Members of the central
administration of the union of workers of the textiles (union NfR), after
that the mass of workers had refused to process with them, declared: 'The
conduct of workers of the manufacture of Prokhorov throws a shade known
the prestige of the soviet power; all ulterior action of these workers
would defame soviet authorities to eyes of workers other establishments;
this is inadmissible; consequently, the manufacture has to be closed, workers
returned; a commission has to be created which will be able to establish
in the manufactures a severe regime; afterwards, it will be necessary to
recruit new workers surroundings."
<p>13. Later, in exile in Paris, Arshinov (and Makhno, and other Russian
militants in exile) made a deep criticism and end by a violent confrontation
with Volin. In 1927, in an "Answer to the confusionists of Anarchism",
provoked by a previous answer from Volin and other answers to the "Organisational
platform" of the GARE where Arshinov collaborated (cf. further), this is
what the group writes:
<p>"A whole category of individuals proclaiming to be anarchists has nothing
in common with the anarchists. to gather this people (and on what basis?)
in "a family" and name that grouping an " anarchist organisation", would
be not only nonsense, but absolutely harmful. (...) This is not an universal
blend, but in the contrary sound anarchist forces and their organisation
in an anarchist-communist party which is essential for the movement. (...)
To stabilize the movement, it is necessary to get rid of these trends and
deviations; but the stabilisation is in an important manner avoided by
the frank or disguised individualists who are part of the movement. The
authors of the "Answer to the platform" undoubtly belong to this latest
category".
<p>14. Makhno will found Lenin at that time, doubtless also blinded (like
Szamuelly, for instance, who will go from Budapest to Moscow to ask Lenin
to correct the politic of Bela Kun in Hungary!) by the idea that Lenin
could not agree with the development of the bolshevik party as force of
reconstruction of the State.
<p>15. Antonov-Ovseenko had denounced the punitive measures envisaged against
Makhno and was kept away for this reason by Trotsky, June 15th. End April
1919, Antonov-Ovseenko wrote to the Izvestia of Karkhov editorial staff:
"In your 5th April issue, you have published an article titled "Down with
the makhnovchtchina". This article is full of untrue facts and contains
an openly provocative tone. Such attacks harm our struggle against the
counterrevolution. In this struggle, Makhno and his brigade have demonstrated
and demonstrate an extraordinary revolutionary bravery, they deserve not
insults from officials, but the fraternal recognition of all the worker
and peasant revolutionaries". Antonov-Ovseenko will unfortunately not always
have the same attitude facing the revolutionaries: he will be one of the
main responsibles in the stalinist repression in Spain in 1936.
<p>16. More stalinist than Stalin then, Trotsky intended "to put back order
in the Donetz's basin" with an iron grip on behalf of the soviet State.
In the framework of the prohibition he decreed to hold a "makhnovist" peasants
and workers congress, event that was the chosen pretext to start the repression
against partisans of the Insurrectional Army, Trotsky concluded: "I order
(...) to seize all traitors abandoning voluntarily their units to rejoin
Makhno and to defer them to the revolutionary Court as deserters (...).
I proclaim order will be restored with an iron hand. Enemies of the worker
and peasant Red Army, profiteers, kulaks, rioters (it lacks only "hooligans"
-NfR!!!), Makhno's or Grigoriev's agents  will be pitilessly eliminated
by sure and firm regular units. Long live revolutionary order, discipline
and struggle against enemies of the people!"
<p>17. Lenin thought at this moment that all was lost and had asked and
obtained asylum in Finland!
<p>18. If the Red Army has won some victories thanks to Trotsky's so-called
"military science", this bourgeois science found its foundations into white
terror (red painted, and widely described in his famous book: "Terrorism
and Communism"!) he imposed on troops and he has well summarized, it seems,
by asserting that if "moving forward carried out to a possible death, retreating
led to a certain death"!
<p>19. In this same month of November 1919, the commander of 3rd makhnovist
insurrectional regiment, Crimea Polonsky, was executed with other members
compromised, like him, in an "authoritarian organization"!
<p>20. Speaking of "Third Social Revolution" is obviously an absurdity,
if we consider -and we do it so!- there is only <b><u>one communist social
revolution</u></b>, as there will be only one and only passage from the
bourgeoisie worldwide dictatorship to the one as well worldwide of the
proletariat. But in the context of reconstruction of the State in Russia
around the same Bolsheviks who had taken part to the insurrection of October
1917, the fact to assert the necessity of a "Third Social Revolution",
concentrates the proletarian criticism of the February and October limits,
and denounces the Soviets government as a bourgeois government!
<p>21. Point 2 of this agreement stipulated "the Insurrectional Revolutionary
Army (Makhnovist) of Ukrain, by passing through Soviets's territory, and
encountering the front, or crossing the fronts, will not accept in its
ranks detachments of the Red Army, neither deserters of this same army."
As one sees, the Bolsheviks felt enormously difficulties to struggle against
the numerous rallies of their army to Makhno's!
<p>22. One finds here already, a prefiguration of what will happen in '36-'37
in Spain (then in the world), where the republicans will succeed to transform
the revolutionary civil war into imperialistic war. There also, the army
of the Republic will transform the revolutionary proletarians into cannon
fodder, under the pretext of alliance against "the main enemy", the fascists
of Franco in this case.
<p>23. Makhno was considered as a real death-dodger, having personally
and on horse-back led, at the head of detachments he commanded, <b>more
than two hundred assaults</b> against enemy armies! He passed the romanian
frontier, the osselets of a foot completely broken into pieces, the thigh,
the appendix, the chin and the cheek shot through by several bullets received
during the last weeks of fighting!!!
<p>24. This platform is now more known under the name of "Arshinov's Platform",
so much the international pseudo-anarchist small circles put some energy
to disparage the collective step that was at the origin of, and to reduce
it then to the initiative of Arshinov! One saved thus Makhno's head for
his nice "Robin Hood" imagery, and one could confirm the bolshevik character
of the platform (and to invalidate the discussion from), by insisting on
the fact that his author had finished bolshevik! For the little history,
Arshinov returned in Russia in 1933 and was executed in 1937 "for having
wanted to restore anarchism in Russia"!
<p>25. We refer the reader to the excellent work from the honourable citizen
of the French Academy, Sir Joseph Kessel who at that time found to express
his traumatism in the most vulgar leninism by writing the famous "Makhno
and his Jewess"!
<p>26. There is nevertheless many testimonies relating the growing displeasure
in the Red Army itself, and the possibilities to lead this situation to
a revolutionary viewpoint, during all this period. Here are some extracts
from a text published in 1928 by a former sailor of the Black Sea, in the
newspaper "Dielo Truda": "In the time of the conclusion of the treaty between
Makhno and the bolshevik power in October 1920, the sailors' state of mind
was bellicose and hostile to the commissioners of the Tcheka. Makhno's
name was very popular. If there had been an organizational connection with
Cronstadt, the crews of ships would have organized unanimously. Tcheka
had no influence on us. (...) We had projects for a long time about the
Tcheka. We had decided to blow up the building that accommodated it near
a park (in Mariupol, where the Black Sea fleet was based - NfR). The success
was possible therefore, but not only there was no connection with Cronstadt,
but also we did not at all heard speaking about Makhno and we have retained
our vague impulses of action. (...) Thus, because of the absence of organization,
the best revolutionary possibilities were neglected."
