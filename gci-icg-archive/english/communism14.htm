<h1>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+4>Editorial</font></font></h1>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nearly two decades ago the bourgeoisie provided
us with triumphant speeches about what it referred to as “big upheavals
in the East”. The end of so-called communism was announced amidst a blaze
of publicity and was supposed to sound like a brilliant worldwide harmonization.
Mankind was going to enter a new era without war and full of prosperity.
But the capitalist utopia of a world without contradiction promptly came
up against its own reality. The same historical limits of capital arose
all over again. Capital isn’t able to dissociate its positive poles of
concentration, wealth, and “peace” on one hand, and negative poles of desertification,
poverty, and war on the other. The myth of an eternal and smooth development
of wealth, which the bourgeoisie lived on, is collapsing. Obviously, misery
hasn’t vanished! The fall of the Berlin Wall and all the promises of change
appeared for what they really are: the restoration of a fa&ccedil;ade.
Capital has seen its contradictions sharpen: valorisation and devalorisation,
development of and constraint upon productive forces, etc. The war between
capitals is fiercer than ever.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">The myth of a world without contradiction
evaporated before it took shape. “Fa&ccedil;ade restorations”, and successive
governments following one another at an ever more frantic pace, face a
multiplication of inter-capitalist armed conflicts. The bourgeoisie can
no longer define the future other than as an ever-escalating crisis. The
cornered bourgeoisie is finally incapable of hiding the horrible rising
doubt, about the permanence of its own system: capital suddenly feels insecure
about its destiny.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Bosses, trade unionists, politicians, managers,
ideologists, scientists, merchants, etc., i.e. all of the capitalist administrators
are haunted by hesitation. Incapable of grasping the future of the world
beyond capitalism, their limited point of view systematically clashes with
the figures of their own economic indicators that force them to lay off,
restrict, cut down, repress, etc.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Then, the doubt pattern becomes society’s
dominant pattern. The capitalists are at a loss and have doubts about everything.
About the future, of course, but also about their allies, about the competence
of their subordinates, about their investment possibilities, about their
own management programmes, about the benefits of liberalism as well as
those of protectionism, etc.; all sectors of society begin to doubt. After
the certainties of the post-war and reconstruction years, here now are
black years where scepticism reigns supreme. Capitalist religion is turning
into a big question mark!</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">But this doubt pattern also settles as the
ideology prevailing within the very working class. Just as the bourgeoisie
doubts about the possibility of an unlimited valorisation of capital, the
working class doubts about the ineluctability of the revolutionary perspective
of the proletarian struggle, historically determined to destroy the capitalist
society and to establish communism, a human society at last. Scepticism
among the proletariat results in questions like: “Do we form a class?”,
“What’s the need for getting organized?”, “Why fight? Our mottos, distorted
by the enemy, are hardly recognizable. So why go on using them?”, etc.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">The few classist organizations that try to
stand against the widespread resignation are not spared either. The repeated
assaults of this defeatist ideology, by instilling a false need to call
into question their essence, is corrupting and disrupting them too. All
you have to do to measure the devastating effects that this generalized
doubt ideology has among organized militants is check the number of militant
brochures around the world that, as opposed to “outmoded communism”, advocate
re-evaluation, doubt and modernism as a line of conduct.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Our group is also confronted with this feature
of present times. For instance, when we report in our publications the
ongoing struggles of our class, doubts happen to arise even from close
contacts of our group. “Was there a proletarian insurrection in Iraq in
1991, in Albania in 1997? What guarantees do we have that the information
is reliable? What is the source?”, etc. Under the yoke of social peace,
these comrades rely more on bourgeois disinformation than on direct evidence
and testimonies brought back by local comrades. The problem worsens when
the prevailing scepticism associated with life’s every day misery prevent
solidarity and common action in support of these struggles.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Proletarians don’t relate to other proletarian
struggles around the world. These struggles remain terribly confined to
the factory, to the workshop, to the protection of jobs, etc. Their standpoint
is marked by immediatism, localism, fragmentation and corporatism. Beyond
the walls of the workshops and factories, it’s the void. “What will the
future hold for us?” is such a dreadful thought that everybody gives up
and thinks only of making a niche. On one hand, hammered out pictures of
starvation, wandering, massacres, and pollution; denunciation in the media
of financial scandals, generalized corruption at all levels of society,
the “injustice” of Justice – all this contributes to the trivialization
of these very real disasters and generates a terrible feeling of powerlessness.
On the other hand, the lack of class criteria, the dominance of particularism,
the weight of individualism, the terror of repression that hovers over
any actions that challenges the social consensus and somewhat reappropriates
class struggle methods – all this makes proletarians, even the combative
ones, apprehensive to assume the international and internationalist dimension
of their own struggle. This generalized uncertainty is such that proletarians
are blinkered, confined to a “here and now” standpoint and are cut off
from any historical perspective; they no longer trust their force as a
class.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Against the power of this ideology of doubt,
against retreat into one’s shell, against the apprehension of the future,
against the paralysing dictatorship of localism, particularism, and immediatism,
it appears vital to wave the communist flag higher than ever. The bourgeois
habitually rob our mottos from us, our flags, and our terminology (in order
to distort them), but they cannot confiscate the programme they embody,
they cannot destroy the militant practice that stands up for the one and
only perspective contained in the concrete communist movement: i.e. the
complete destruction of this moribund capitalist world state, the revolutionary
abolition of wage labour, classes and Value!</font>
<center>
<h2>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">oOo</font></h2></center>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">These are the very unfavourable conditions under
which, more than six years after the publication of the last issue of “Communism”
in English (June 2002), we are publishing a new one. In spite of all the
difficulties that our little group met in the development of this issue,
it is essential for us to continue publishing material in English. Assuming
the vanguard tasks of the struggle is a necessity and not a choice. Too
often, proletarian organizations or even isolated militants remain confined
to the geographical limits imposed by capital, and therefore consent to
the frontiers that divide the world proletariat. Comrades! Today, and not
“later”, is the time we must organize ourselves directly on an international
level. “Down with all frontiers!” must become a motto that is part of the
militant reality of all our expressions of struggle. Let us overcome the
frontiers, obstacles, problems of language, of “culture”, etc. and let
us build up, let us organize, let us centralize our efforts and our strengths
to abolish the Old World!</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">It’s in this frame of mind that the Internationalist
Communist Group has produced this publication in English that reaffirms
our refusal to submit to the “every man for himself”, the ultra-immediatism
and aversion towards organization that presently undermine our class.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Comrades, let us struggle against the apathy
that capital has forced down on us! Let us stop being objects, the objects
of the exploitation of capital. When we fight back, the bourgeoisie threatens
us with more and more misery. It claims that our lack of abnegation, of
sacrifice, of dynamism, and a fortiori our struggles are responsible for
the failure of society. But reality is the exact opposite. The less we
struggle, the freer this society feels to sacrifice us on the altar of
Value. Let us take our destiny into our own hands and let us change the
world! Let us be the subject of our own history.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Comrades, faced with this militant effort
that you now have in your hands, don’t remain passive. This review in English
is a collective tool for struggle. Use it as a weapon, as a collective
organizer. Don’t passively consume the revolutionary publications. We insist
that the material we publish in various languages be circulated, criticized,
improved, and surpassed, so that together we may strengthen our community
of struggle against this agonizing and murderous world. The language quality
of this issue remains, alas, poor. We nonetheless thank the close comrades
who helped us out in the correction of the texts, and without whom this
issue could not come into existence. In this way they take part in the
proletariat’s collective and international action to abolish frontiers.
We take this opportunity to renew our call to any English-speaking militant
who could help us correct and improve the translations of our texts. Comrades,
we need your help. Let us get together, correspond, and be critical, let
us circulate the information about our struggles, let us read each other’s
publications with attention and with the intent of overcoming all the limits
imposed by the bourgeoisie.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Today more than yesterday, let us brandish
communism in our confrontation against the whole of the bourgeoisie in
its multiple facets, whether classical social democrats, nationalists,
Stalinists, Maoists, fascists, environmentalists, etc. while putting forward
the primary content of communism: i.e. the negation of the whole capitalist
being!</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Against Economy, against Politics and Religion,
against Art, against Science and Progress, against Family, Labour and all
Fatherlands, against wage labour, let us shout louder than ever: long live
communism, long live the worldwide social revolution, and long live the
proletariat’s international communist organization!</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">In spite of all those who promise, in a variety
of ways, the survival of this society, we do not doubt that, like any living,
social, historical organism, like any previous society, capital is an entity
that contains its own lethal contradictions. Its overcoming is not announced
by a new religion, but by the living negation that the class of men condemned
to work in order to survive - the revolutionary proletariat - carries within
itself.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">We don’t “believe” in communism. It is apparent,
in practical terms, in the movement that unfolds before our eyes, in the
real movement aimed at the abolition of the established order. Manifestations
of this movement have flared these past years in proletarian struggles
in Iraq, Albania, Argentina, Algeria, Bolivia, etc. as well as in some
initiatives (even modest ones) to transform the proletariat’s objective
community of interests into an international, organized and centralized
active community of struggle. No, we do not doubt that class solidarity
will soon rise against this society based upon selfishness, individualism
and retreat into one’s shell; a solidarity that emerges from the struggle
of the proletariat to free itself from its chains.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let us not doubt about communism; let us struggle

<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">General characteristics of contemporary struggles</font></u></h2>
Fifteen years ago we took stock of the situation by portraying the struggles
that characterize the current phase of capitalism, without taking into
account any elements particular to specific confrontations. (2) Since then,
nothing has fundamentally changed with regard to those general characteristics.
The current events confirm the main features that we presented then: international
attempts to channel proletarian revolts and obvious signs of rupture, still
systematically characterised, from the proletarian point of view, by strengths
and weaknesses similar to those we had highlighted. The capitalist society
catastrophe, that continues to take shape and aggravate (3), as well as
the tendency for radicalisation of the contradictions and confrontations,
bring up once again the issue of the revolutionary leadership and the destruction
of the international capitalist dictatorship. Facing today's barbarity,
the issue of the proletarian social project (the social revolution, the
destruction of the commodity society re-emerges as the only possible alternative.
<p>This text, while presenting a brief analysis of the development of the
balance of forces between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, is a denunciation
of the “new” attempts made to channel the proletarian energies, and more
particularly those that take shape through these summits and anti-summits
that seem to dominate the international reality; various pseudo-radical
ideologies that emerge from the clash. As a direct product of a debate
among proletarians openly considering the issue of international power
and destruction of the universal capitalist dictatorship, this text is
also a contribution to the fight of the proletariat for its autonomy. It
is then an element of struggle for the constitution of a self-direction
breaking away from all the ideologies that intend to maintain us chained
to the old social-democrat chariot, redecorated for the occasion with some
new garments.
<p>In Communism n&deg;9, we had already signalled that the traditional
forms of bourgeois containment had lost most of their lure. We pointed
out that the traditional forms of struggle, such as “strikes” organized
by the trade unions, pacific demonstrations, and even the national political
system and its electoral circus didn't trigger much enthusiasm anymore.
“<i>While the old state mediations have lost their capacity to act as safety
valves… the proletariat, which is supposed to be dead and buried, surges
forwards ever more explosively, without accepting mediations, without being
stopped by little strikes, peaceful demos, or promises of elections.</i>”
<p>We also noted that contemporary struggles are characterised by violent
and uncontrolled proletarian explosions directed against private property
and all political and social forces that defend it. Since then, these explosions
of proletarian rage against the capital have repeatedly renewed, distinguished
by “<i>the firm and violent action of the proletariat which occupies the
streets and violently confronts the whole state apparatus</i>”, as we mentioned
in our text. The number of countries –Iraq, Venezuela, Burma, Algeria,
Morocco, Rumania, Argentina, United States (Los Angeles)- where this type
of explosion occurred has continually increased: Albania, Indonesia, Bangladesh,
Ecuador, Argentina once again (Santiago del Estero, Neuquen…), Bolivia,
Algeria (Kabylia). Every time, these examples reveal the same bourgeois
incapacity to contain the struggle, marked by a violent opposition to everything
that the present society stands for (including political parties and trade
unions of the democratic opposition), and by expropriation of bourgeois
property, more or less organized and led by vanguard elements. “<i>By sweeping
away the ancestral prejudices and challenging state terrorism, proletarians
take what they need and try thus to destroy all the mediations which they
are condemned to by capital: money, wages, work, etc.</i>”
<p>Facing this human tendency to directly re-appropriate one’s own life,
we noted, in 1993, that the bourgeoisie invariably counterattacked with
their eternal “carrot, stick and disinformation”. Manipulation of information
and systematic concealment of the universal content of those revolts, presenting
them as “student” riots, or “miners”, “Palestinians”, “Kurds”, “Muslims”,
“Berbers”… We also pointed out that the bourgeois counterattack was always
based on the granting of some minor concessions and on the development
of a selective repression, aiming at isolating the proletariat from its
vanguard elements. In that text, we also analysed the weaknesses of the
current proletarian struggles (short-lived riots, finally defeated, lack
of permanent proletarian associationism, absence of a worker’s press, lack
of historic memory, ignorance of the revolutionary program…), as well as
the need and possibility of overcoming these weaknesses and turning this
discontinuous process of uprisings into an ascendant process leading to
social revolution. (4)
<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">The left-wing bourgeoisie’s need to reorganize
itself: renovation attempts</font></u></h2>
The current left-wing bourgeoisie endorses the program that the social
democracy has always defended: lesser evil, democratism, populism, trade
unionism, pacifism, and support to the so-called “third world”… But in
this society, where the devaluation of capital proceeds unbridled, where
commodity must be labelled “new” to be sold and where ideological production
is wholly integrated into the commodity production, the old ideas of the
dominant class also need to be incessantly recycled to remain effective
at containing the social assault. More than anyone else, the left-wing
bourgeoisie’s renovation attempts comply with this tendency, widely subscribing
to the “neo” fashion: “neo” Marxism, “new” left-wing, anti-“neo”-liberalism
(5)…
<p>The immediate motive of these renovations is directly generated by capital’s
necessity to respond to the deficiency experienced by the bourgeoisie every
time the proletarian wrath expresses itself outside and against the traditional
containment measures of the class struggle.
<p>A third element that has forced the left-wing bourgeoisie to recycle
and put on new garments to conceal its putrefying body and hideous face,
resides in the socio-economic catastrophe of the countries labelled “socialist”
by the bourgeoisie, as well as in the subsequent deterioration of the image
of the related left-wing. In actual fact, neither the Trotskyites’ critical
support “with reservations” policy, nor the radical Maoism escaped the
collapse. With an implacable clarity, the system those movements so dearly
defended (unreservedly or not) confirmed to have never been anything else
but the most brutal exploitation of the proletariat. Without the excuse
of any revolution –or social counter-revolution, as they so often claimed-
(6) the dominant class of those countries simply and openly declared its
preference for “capitalism and democracy”. The whole international left-wing
bourgeoisie was then forced to repudiate its life-long love affair with
these references and start searching for other fables to try and remain
credible. Only certain leftist factions of the social democrat spectrum
continue, through their support for Castrism, to obstinately cling to the
defence (unreserved or not) of this monstrous Stalinist offspring called
“socialism within one country”. (7)
<p>But the left-wing bourgeoisie has no autonomy with regards to the right
wing –even on a terminological basis- it follows in its wake. The particularities
it endorses have always been determined by the evolution and contradictions
of world capital’s cycle, and even when they seem different, looking closely,
most of the time they appear to be the same old stories, told differently.
So, to the ideologies of the worldwide bourgeoisie, victor of the Second
World War –democracy, human rights, anti-terrorism, anti-authoritarianism,
anti-fascism… (8)-, were added the ideologies of the factions most maltreated
by free trade. In reality these ideologies were merely the vulgar antithesis
of what the international free tradist dominant bourgeoisie presently still
enforces. Every time the classic free tradist politics (which has nothing
to do with anything “neo”) adopt a new terminology (globalisation, global
village…) the old leftist bourgeoisie pseudo <i>anti-imperialist</i> defines
itself on the basis of the “anti” prefix: <i>anti</i>-globalisation, <i>anti</i>-neo-liberalism…
<p>Even the supporters of national liberation, considering their catastrophic
results and their out of date discourse, started recycling themselves into
<i>anti</i>-globalists…
<p>In reality, there is nothing new under the capitalist sun. All this
is nothing more than cheap chatter, a terminology made up by international
capital, backed up by publicity agencies that seek to improve its image
and enforce its present objectives pretending they are something novel.
Capital is worldwide by essence; it has always been global. Historically,
the starting point of capitalism is not the nation (as Marx said, the world
market precedes the national market), but the revolution of the world market
(that existed for quite a long time). This occurred at the end of the 15<sup>th</sup>
century through the generalisation of value on a world scale and found
its conclusion in the 16<sup>th</sup> century with the impossibility of
a capitalist accumulation without a conquest of the production, and, finally,
through the historic subsumption of humanity by capital. In capital’s history,
the global always precedes the particular or local. Free trade is the general
politic of the hegemonic faction of capital, well before the origin of
the worldwide market or the origin of the worldwide money. This brings
us back more than a thousand years ago, and since then, this politic has
constantly opposed the interests of the protectionist factions. Free trade
and anti-free trade (with or without the adjunction of the “neo” prefix),
globalism and anti-globalism, the regionalism… are nothing but distinct
expressions of the everlasting battle fought by the bourgeois factions.
One defends the upholding of protectionism, source of its accumulation,
and the other, more coherent in the strict application of the rule of value
on an international scale, is willing to breach this protectionism.
<p>If nowadays the instruments of fabrication of public opinion so insistently
emphasize these tendencies, represented in a roughly caricature way by
the international summits and bourgeois anti-summits, it’s precisely to
trick the proletariat into a struggle that is not its own, and try to provide
a response to the explosions of proletarian rage in which the exploited
aim at re-establishing the struggle on real classist grounds. Social democracy,
as historic counter-revolutionary party intended for the proletarians,
tries to pull it out of the streets and prevent direct action to maintain
the proletariat’s submission to a number of mediations that turn it into
a manoeuvrable support force to the inter-bourgeois struggle. (9)
<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">Ideas and personages of the “neo” left wing</font></u></h2>
During the 70’s and the 80’s, it called itself the “new left-wing” and
gathered a wide spectrum of social democrat ideologies, claimed more democracy,
more socialism, more anti-imperialism, more statism, more populism, cursing
the large corporations, the monopoles…
<p>Today, it goes by the name of anti-globalisation, anti-free trade, anti-International
Monetary Fund, anti-worldwide trade... it preaches in the name of the civilian
society and a diffuse citizenship and defines itself through an opposition
against the financial and multinational capital, and, in its wide majority,
in favour of the “Tobin” tax… But in reality, it’s the one and the same
dog, even though it wears different collars.
<p>Indeed, the left-wing bourgeoisie on the whole was able to become aware
of its own incapacity to contain the proletariat, but, in the image of
this greyish recycled paper hoping to be sold as “new”, it decided to mobilise
its forces around the so-called “globalisation”. It tries to focus everything
on the major assemblies of the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund,
the World Trade Organization, or any other apparatus of the world state
of capital.
<p>Trade unions and political parties in decrepitude, feminists and ecologists
having lost their credibility, Keynesian economists, all kinds of pacifist
and libertarian movements (10), philanthropists, journalists, third-worldists
and “anti-imperialists”, non-governmental organizations and humanitarian
organisms, bankrupted farmers and animal-rights associations… all of them,
without exception, seek a new political virginity by mustering against
these meetings. Has-been political stars, completely disavowed, reappear
in public and summon citizenship celebrations with the intention of defying
the summits organized by official representatives. In the carnival-like
context of these flashy folkloric parades, pacific and docile, under strict
surveillance by the law-enforcement forces and the trade unions (like the
powerful European Trade Unions Confederation), a heterogeneous variety
of personalities like the leaders of the support committees to Marcos’
pseudo-guerrilla or that caricature of radical farmer called Bov&eacute;,
or even bygone personages of the “champagne socialists”,… try to constitute
a “global option”, that truly brings nothing new in regards to the old
bourgeois socialism of the 19<sup>th</sup> century. And let us not forget
to add to this charming picture, the “anti-globalisation” support of openly
rightist, nationalist, fascist and pro-nazi personages and organizations,
like Charles Pasqua, former Minister of the Interior in France, or the
LePenist youth of the French National Front.
<p>The common denominator of the <i>anti-globalisation</i> holdall is the
pretence of establishing a capitalism that would supposedly be “more human”,
more democratic, that is to say, one which would reinforce the democratic
and citizen domination on the human species. The watchwords against globalisation,
the IMF, the World Bank, “neo”-liberalism clearly confirm that it is not
a matter of destroying capitalism, but rather perpetuating it.
<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">Anti-globalisation ideologies</font></u></h2>
The
<i>Attac</i> association (Action for a Tobin Tax of Aid to the Citizens)
–the name alone is already rather remarkable- is the meeting point of old
social democrat structures and personalities, merely given a new physiognomy.
It represents undoubtedly the most important international institution
of the anti-globalisation scene. Alongside, stand many other networks,
federations and organizations, a mingling of ideological movements, trade
unions, political parties, charities, religious organizations and NGO,
such as the Tri-Continental Centre, the Worldwide Women’s march, the 2000
Jubilee, the Continental Social Alliance, the People’s Global Action, the
“Monde Diplomatique”, the “Ya Basta” association, the Global Resistance
Movement, the Farmer’s Confederation. (11)
<p>Although they introduce themselves under a variety of aspects and platforms,
these organizations are, as we have previously said, the result of the
leftist bourgeoisie’s recycling that by any means attempts to regain a
bit of credibility, and to put forward, with regards to the current capitalist
catastrophe, a reformist alternative responding to the increasingly uncontrollable
explosions of the international proletariat. Just to give an idea of how
much the program of these organizations replicates the old bourgeois reformist
program, we shall quote and emphasize some considerations extracted from
the constitutive platform of the <i>Attac</i> association and the World
Social Forum of Porto Alegre.
<p>So,
<i>Attac</i> does not claim to fight against capitalism, but against
what it calls “financial globalisation”. To do so, it proposes to use the
Tobin Tax and to hamper speculation. The platform starts as follows:
<p>“<i>The financial globalisation aggravates the economical insecurity
and social inequalities. It bypasses and belittles people’s opinions, the
democratic institutions and the sovereign states in charge of the common
interest. It substitutes them with purely speculative logic expressing
the exclusive interests of international corporations and financial markets</i>.”
<p>Its conception of the world is based on the good old social democrat
method consisting in only considering the consequences, denying the determinant
causes, and analysing only a few particularly notorious and harmful manifestations
of capitalism, and omitting that these are the necessary and inevitable
products of this whole social system. The same way social democracy founded
its revisionism on the imperialism presented at that time as a novelty
(12), today <i>Attac</i> elaborates its own on the pseudo-novelty of financial
globalisation. Yesterday as today, something “new” had to be put forward
to justify politics aiming at reforming capital. In both cases, it is only
about diverting the proletariat from its struggle against the very foundations
of the capitalist society.
<p>The social democrat theories of imperialism and ultra-imperialism (Kautsky)
constitute the keystone of this manoeuvre. Yesterday as today, this theory
conceives capitalism to have entered a new phase, distinct from those in
the past, and that would have transformed its essential nature. According
to this theory, capitalism in its imperialistic phase formally centralises
itself in a world decisional centre –or several ones in dispute-, based
on the concentration of financial capital (defined as the merging of banking
capital and industry capital), the large monopolist international corporations,
the exploitation of capitals and the competition between corporations and
governments for the apportionment of the world.
<p>Therefore at the beginning of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, just like
today, the novelty would have then been the world domination of financial
capital and monopolies, as it was explicitly theorised at the time by the
right-wing social democrat Rudolf Hilferding. Lenin adopted this theory
in his famous pamphlet on imperialism. Today as yesterday, with <i>Attac</i>
and all the “anti-globalisation” groups, social democracy claims to stand
against this financial capital, demanding more democracy and more state
control from capital: “<i>people’s opinions, democratic institutions and
sovereign states</i>”.
<p>It is easily noted that behind these associations, these old and new
physiognomies, there is nothing, absolutely nothing, new: it is nothing
but the old rotten program of social democracy that has always called for
a “<i>more social</i>” (sic), “<i>more human</i>” (sic) capitalism, against
the notorious dehumanisation produced by capitalism itself. Today as yesterday,
all of them put forward “<i>people’s opinions</i>”, that is to say populism,
in opposition to proletarian classism. They put forward “<i>democratic
institutions</i>” in opposition to the classist position of struggle against
these institutions to enforce proletarian dictatorship, and finally, they
put forward the “<i>sovereign states in charge of common interest</i>”
in opposition to the classic revolutionary standpoint of utter destruction
of the bourgeois state, and all this bullshit about the sovereignty of
the state. For, as Marx and Bakunin affirmed, the greater the sovereignty
of the state, the harsher the oppression for its subjects.
<p><i>Attac</i> is an openly social democrat expression that, as such,
denounces the increase of wealth and poverty and would like the citizen
opinion and pressure on the states to regulate capitalism’s excesses. From
an historic point of view, it defines itself as a right-wing social democrat
expression, because it doesn’t allege any opposition to capitalism itself
and to the contrary, claims to be in favour of the freedom generated by
capitalism to achieve its goals. It appeals to the governments for a control
of this freedom (not to be abolished!). In no way does it criticize productive
capital, nor, of course, capitalist exploitation (the extortion of profit
is implicitly legitimated). It contests capital’s benefits it considers
excessive with regards to the undeniable widening of misery and the non-productive
speculation. As if, once again, it were possible to deal with the consequences
without dealing with the causes.
<p>The constitutive platform of <i>Attac</i> states: “<i>Capitals’ total
freedom of circulation, the tax havens and the explosion of the volume
of speculative transactions drive the states into a frantic race to obtain
the favours of the big investors… Such evolution engenders a permanent
increase in capital’s income to the detriment of labour’s income, the generalisation
of precariousness and extension of poverty</i>.”
<p><i>Attac</i> doesn’t even try to conceal its dread for the social revolution
and admits its function is to avoid it at all costs, even if this is all
said using a fashionable terminology: “<i>To respond to the double challenge
of a social implosion and a feeling of political despair demands a civic
and militant compromise</i>.” While we’re at it, and as it is also a very
fashionable trend, we note that among the current social democracy, freethinker’s
style, or in the libertarian spheres, the whole of the classic concepts
has been revised, re-interpreted and re-adapted to conform today’s likings,
by removing from them any classist content. Because it has reached decisive
importance, we’ll call attention to the falsification related to the concept
of exploitation, keystone of the constitution of the proletariat as a homogeneous
world class. According to the new interpretations, exploitation wouldn’t
be the surplus value extortion, which, directly and objectively, unifies
in misery the whole proletarianized humanity, and which, historically,
was decisive for the proletariat to recognize itself as a class.
<p>That’s why one can sometimes hear: “<i>they make me work so hard it
is exploitation!</i>” As if work weren’t always exploitation! Or: “<i>the
workers of such and such country are exploited</i>.” As if those from the
other countries weren’t exploited! Or else: “<i>multinational corporations
are exploitative institutions</i>.” As if local ones weren’t exploitative!
It is also said that “<i>monopolies exploit and destroy the planet’s resource</i>”
as if it weren’t capital itself that exploits and destroys everything!
As if capital didn’t dictate the action of every business of this planet!
We can also hear: “<i>imperialists exploit us!</i>” as if there were any
non-imperialist bourgeois or any bosses that do not exploit! And finally,
we are asked to believe that we are not subjected to exploitation, that
exploitation is not this world’s rule, but merely constitutes an exception,
an extreme case that only applies in very distant places. “<i>In the countryside,
in the third-world countries</i>.” The further we believe it to be, the
better it suits social democracy. So the remedy to this should be “<i>to
manifest solidarity with their misery, accept austerity and protest less
here</i>”. To this we must add that, for them, <i>solidarity</i> has nothing
to do with the classist concept of our struggle, but in reality belongs
to the Judeo-Christian concept of guilt and sin and calls for a charitable
attitude. It is then still a matter of a typical worldview of the dominant
class and its openly bourgeois socialism.
<p>This falsification leads to many others, such as the very concept of
proletariat, which they mention as little as possible. And when they refer
to it, they confine it into a mere sociologic category (<i>the workers</i>,
as imposed by Stalinism), never as a constantly evolving revolutionary
subject, which deprives the proletariat of all revolutionary perspective
and denies the fact that it bears the only social project alternative to
the current world: communism, the human worldwide community.
<p>Returning to <i>Attac</i>, we can obviously note that the measures they
propose are in full coherence with their social democrat worldview: taxation
of the financial capital, major state control over profits and tax havens,
claims for more democracy: “<i>to this end, the co-signers hereby create
the association ATTAC (Action for a Tobin Tax of Aid to Citizens)… aiming
at deterring international speculation, tax the capital’s income, sanction
tax havens, prevent the generalisation of retirement funds, and, in a general
way, re-conquer the fields lost by democracy to the financial sphere and
oppose all new renunciation of the sovereignty of states on the pretext
of the ‘right’ of investors and merchants.</i>”
<p>The Social Forum of Porto Alegre of January 2001 (that the organizers
intend to renew every year) constitutes one of the examples of summit meetings
(parallel anti-summit par excellence of the leftists bourgeoisie), a widened
expression of the old social democrat ideology, elegantly adorned with
in vogue features like the congresses and counter-congresses. This forum’s
program closely resembles the invariant program of the left-wing bourgeoisie:
“<i>pleading for a democratic agrarian reform with usufruct for the land
cultivators, access to water and seeds, demanding cancellation of the external
debt and reparation for the historic, social and economic debts occasioned
by the external debt, elimination of the tax havens, effective application
of human rights, opposition to all forms of privatisation of natural resources
and public goods, calling for people’s sovereignty and a demilitarised
planet</i>”. (13)
<p>The “<i>proclamation of social movements</i>” holds the program of all
associations, trade unions, parties, present in Porto Alegre, and is filled
with the most remarkable affirmations of the bourgeois credo. It is an
apology for a capitalism devoid of all the harmful consequences inherent
to its being, that engenders neither poverty nor misery nor unemployment,
for a capitalism that does not destroy nature, for a non-patriarchal capitalism,
for a capitalism without racism, in short for a fair and equitable capitalism
in which everyone would live in perfect harmony. “<i>We demand a fair commercial
system that ensures full-employment, food sovereignty, fair trade and well-being.</i>”
<p>That is a pre-eminently bourgeois discourse, according to which, after
correcting a few excesses and injustices, capitalism would embody… the
well-being society! Cynical apologies of the bourgeois society into which
the right wing doesn’t even dare to venture, openly admitting this is all
impossible!
<p>Another recurrent aspect of this anti-globalisation ideology is the
claim for an increased support for what they call the <i>third world</i>,
some going as far as requesting 0.7% of the GDP. What the promoters of
this program do not say, it is that such an aid for development does not
mainly apply to hospitals, schools or other projects linked to capitalist
development, but it is also directed (nearly the whole of it, in certain
countries) into the financing of local armies (so they can buy weapons
from the countries that provided the aid), financing and training of police
officers specialised in anti-subversive and anti-riot action (it is through
those aids the Algerian, Peruvian, Congolese torturers are offered training
in France, Belgium, etc…), buying tear gas produced by Shell with the raw
materials from those “third world” countries, the support for conducting
massacres (“genocides”, “holocausts”), like in Rwanda…
<p>This is, roughly, the <i>anti-globalisation</i> ideology designed by
social democracy, or more precisely, by its right wing. But some expressions
are notably more left orientated, and correspond to other factions of this
historic party of bourgeoisie destined to the proletariat. Indeed, bourgeois
leftism, which formerly defined itself through the defence of so-called
socialism in such-and-such country or of such-and-such “worker’s state”
that are now considered as more or less degenerated, today keeps a low
profile, and does not dare speaking of socialism in positive terms anymore,
and even less of socialist block, but continues to characterize itself
through a politically correct anti-capitalism. As we’ll analyse further
in this text, these leftists, along with the liberal extreme left-wing,
today re-baptised as libertarians, attempt to respond to the class contradictions
that arise, and more particularly to the currents that among the proletariat
express a rupture with the bourgeois society. We shall examine those class
contradictions in order to further evaluate and understand these expressions.
<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">Summits, counter-summits and proletarian
struggle</font></u></h2>
The importance of these summits and anti-summits is probably exaggerated,
because for it to function well capital needs neither international conferences
nor summit meetings. The keystone of homogeneity in the decision making
of capital is essentially rooted in the fact that the dictatorship of the
rate of profit exists everywhere, that it is the origin of all decisions,
the essence of each economic directive, the reason for capitalism to exist,
always and all over the world. The World Bank and the International Monetary
Fund, the multinationals and governments, the parliaments and local administrations,
the associations of states and consortiums, the trusts and the small enterprises,
all apply, whatever the importance of the decision to be taken, the criteria
of profitability of capital (their own or the one they administer); and
in the same way, within the enterprises, from the highest leader to the
last worker, they are all forced to apply these criteria if they want to
keep their jobs, and this is independent of the fact that this situation
is advantageous to some, whereas it means suffering and the daily alienation
from their life for the others. Capital is precisely characterised by its
democracy, by its capacity to co-opt those who, among its subjects, will
be the most unscrupulous in satisfying its appetite for profit, those who
will display the greatest skill at imposing its despotism without mercy,
whether they are leaders, governors, international civil servants, local
administrators, trade-union chiefs, or torturers. Let us simply remember
the workers’ leaders who, at all times, were co-opted by the government
of capital, from Noske and Walesa to Lula! The other face of this democracy
that allows co-opting the workers’ leaders to serve capital is the daily
despotism that imposes value in process against human life. Omnipotent
dictatorship of the rate of profit that, moreover, develops competition
between proletarians and leads to the struggle of each against each other,
always in favour of imposing the greatest possible rate of accumulation.
<p>But beyond the myth existing around the importance of the formal centralism
with which capital is endowed, it is clear that capitalism has decisional
centres (meetings, institutions, places, organisms, people...) at its disposal,
which, whenever needed, centralise some global decisions, obeying this
omnipresent dictatorship of the rate of profit. Within these centres are
generally announced the measures that attack the standard of living of
proletarians; while between the more decisive factions of the bourgeoisie
are signing agreements. These summit meetings of capitalistic power are
publicly announced in the media, in search of popular support for the leaders
of capital and for the measures that emerge from those meetings. And naturally,
these meetings also obey to the hazards of negotiations between the different
factions of capital, as well as to the necessity to constitute constellations
and alliances in an attempt to improve the balance of forces against other
factions, as it is the case for the regional common markets. Another purpose
of these summits and anti-summits is to make a show about the importance
of these bourgeois polarisations, which capital needs to channel any proletarian
protest.
<p>Therefore, although the decisional importance of these summits is exaggerated,
and even though their spectacularisation and their pseudo protest constitutes
a necessity of the reproduction of bourgeois domination, it is normal that
the proletariat has always considered them as an attack against its own
life, and this, whether these meetings take place in only one country or
whether they gather the bourgeoisie of various ones, whether they are governmental,
organised by political parties, trade unions, or whether they originate
from the structuring of these forces at an international scale. At any
time these summits have always caused great movements of protest, violent
demonstrations, street fighting, bomb attacks and intense often-armed confrontations.
Against the myth that presents as a new fact the confrontations that break
out nowadays almost everywhere in the world at the time of these summits
(the manipulation of the public opinion always requires making new stuff
from old ones), we could mention many examples that occurred on the five
continents and demonstrate the opposite. We need only remember the great
street battles of the 60’s and 70’s, triggered by the proletariat in America
against the various international summits organised on this continent,
against the meetings of the OAS, of the Alliance for Progress, the World
Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the GATT, or against Presidents
Conferences… We need only remember the enterprises set on fire, factories
and campuses occupied, the violent demonstrations, bomb attacks against
state sites, the strikes, the confrontations with the police, with special
repression units, and in many countries, with the army…
<p>Regarding current events, the class confrontations become more and more
obvious: Davos, Seattle, Nice, Prague, Gothenburg, Naples, and Genoa… (14)
are a manifestation of this. Once more, the proletariat re-emerges exactly
where the different factions of international capital meet to decide how
they will proceed with the exploitation of the proletarians all over the
world. On the one hand stand the official summits and the social democrat
anti-summits, the conferences in the official lounges and the carnival-like
processions dominated by social democracy, the official pseudo protest.
On the other hand the proletariat emerges, outflanking the processions,
in an attempt to impose its direct action (15), smashing shop windows and
expropriating everything that can be, attacking official buildings and
bourgeois property in general, setting fire to everything that represents
the state, and criticising and denouncing aloud, through leaflets, pamphlets
and reviews the NGO, <i>Attac</i>, parties and trade unions.
<p>As one can see, even in these bourgeois lairs and despite the presence
of a lot of recuperation forces, once more both classes of society confront
each other; bourgeoisie against proletariat, conservation of the bourgeois
social order against its global reconsideration. Right- and left-wing may
stage all the protest shows they want, the media can do its best to validate
the options of “globalisation” and “anti-globalisation”, but inevitably,
the critique of capitalism carried by the proletarians leads them to overpower
the containment; and then, inevitably, both antagonistic social projects
re-emerge: perpetuation of the capitalistic catastrophe or social revolution.
<p>Aside from the discussion that we shall approach further and which develops
nowadays within our class about the stance of the proletariat, about its
involvement or not in these processions, about the significance of the
motto “to stand outside and against conferences and anti-conferences” (which
is our position!), about the assessment of this direct action (does it
correctly express the unification and the development of the international
force against capital, or on the contrary does it presuppose a submission
to a show that diverts from the real direct action?). Aside then from this
discussion, there is no doubt of the fact that these explosions express
the rage of our class facing the bourgeois gathered there in order to “decide
the fate of the planet”. (16) In this way the process of proletarian autonomisation
initiated by our class at the time of the summits and anti-summits is extremely
encouraging. It materialises through a rupture with the trade-unionist
containment, through important expressions of violence against this latter,
against private property, against the different state-controlled structures
in place; and all this emphasizes the fact that the real opposition does
not stand between Davos and Porto Alegre, between the World Trade Organisation,
the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and Attac… but, as ever,
between capital (right- as well as left-wing) and the proletariat.
<p>Although the autonomy of the proletariat still remains very relative
within these struggles, they nevertheless express the class war and therefore,
the ever-growing antagonism between humankind and capitalism. These struggles
also put back on the agenda within the community of struggle that develops
–particularly within the vanguard minorities- some central issues, like
proletarian internationalism, the international necessity to get constituted
in force, the issue of the international struggle against the power of
capital and the world state. Of course, from the social viewpoint, solutions
are still far from being found. But the fact that thousands of militants
throughout the world reconsider and re-discuss the central issues of social
revolution definitely constitutes an encouraging fact. If we add to this
the continuity of recurring explosions in different places in the world,
we can say that it is an important step for the revolutionary movement.
<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">Bourgeois channelling, spectacularisation
and falsification</font></u></h2>
It is obvious that the media will never portray things on the basis of
the true bourgeoisie/proletariat polarisation. On the contrary, their function
is to conceal these class antagonisms and channel them into inter-bourgeois
contradictions, and make these spectacular enough to mask the real antagonisms,
to turn the world proletariat into a mass of spectators passively witnessing
the succession of conferences and counter-conferences, and, for the most
active sectors, allows the possibility to applaud or boo the show. Also
allowed, (so that it improves the show’s credibility) are yelling, mottos,
slogans and even, to a certain extent, certain violent actions as long
as they don’t cast doubt on the show or its outlet function. In order to
achieve proper falsification of the information, only official conferences
and <i>Attac </i>and their acolytes are to be taken into consideration,
including of course, the more violent expressions of the same discourse
generated by most hotheaded supporters of the Tobin tax. For the media,
the only opposition that matters is the one opposing summits and anti-summits,
as for example Seattle and Porto Alegre, even if, from time to time, they
can’t avoid showing some images of rioters and anti-conformists.
<p>However, let us remember that those summits and anti-summits are absolutely
not new. During the premise of the so-called First and Second World Wars,
the peace negotiations between superpowers (that, of course, ended up with
war), were handled by staging more or less parallel congresses, organized
by pacifists and social democrats, and, as today, with the purpose of showing
off and duping the proletarians to have them forfeit any inclination towards
direct action. For about 15 years now, the rhythm of these spectacles of
summit and anti-summit meetings has increased frantically: the Rio meeting
on the future of the planet and its parallel anti-meeting, the festivities
and counter-festivities commemorating the 500<sup>th</sup> anniversary
of the America’s “discovery”, conferences on the destruction of the planet
resources followed by ecologic anti-conferences all over the world…
<p>The social forum of Porto Alegre of January 2001 is an excellent example
of a mediatized show staged by capital in order to portray the past, present
and future oppositions as a mere inter-bourgeois question. According to
the fabricants of <i>authorized</i> opinion, the Porto Alegre forum is
the true retort to the Davos meeting, and, to provide it with all the “reality”
that can come out of such exhibitions (like those “apple” soaps that smell
of apple more than an apple itself, the show always seems more real than
reality!), they go as far as staging what they’ll call a “<i>set symbolic
of passion</i>”, based on a live debate “<i>via teleconference between
the cold Davos and the warm Porto Alegre</i>…” (17)
<p>“<i>The Davos team, led by the financier and speculator Georges Soros,
is clad in black suits, wears tie and hair grease, and is serious and silent.
On Porto Alegre’s side, a broad spectrum of races, colourful clothes, languages,
voices… and public. The discussion lasted for forty minutes. Forty minutes,
during which hundreds of persons, crammed in front of the television screens,
applauded enthusiastically, booed, laughed or yelled slogans. Soros and
his team (formed by Mark Malloch, UN consultant, John Ruggie, also UN consultant,
and Bjorn Edlud, president of a Swiss multinational corporation), advised
by image specialists, endeavoured to maintain an Olympian calm, while claiming
to be concerned by poverty and pointing out that well before the current
globalisation and external debt, children already died of starvation in
Africa. From Porto Alegre, Bernard Cassen (Attac) replied with much precision,
demanding the enforcement of the Tobin Tax on financial and speculative
operations and the cancellation of the external debt. Rafael Alegria (Via
Campesina) enumerated the globalisation’s effects on the disarticulation
of the state’s services, on the rise of job losses and the inaccessibility
of land ownership for peasants. But passion was unleashed for two magical
minutes: Hebe Bonafini (<b>18) </b>from the ‘Mothers of the May Square’
declared with a faltering but firm voice: ‘Sir, you stand against us, your
responses are hypocritical. Answer! How many children do you kill a day?’
From Davos, Georges Soros gave the ghost of a smile and remained silent.
So Bonafini yelled at him: ‘Mister Soros, you laugh at the deaths of thousands
of children?’ In front of the television screens, people in Porto Alegre
applauded fervently at the Mother of May. Soros kept his stance, offering
his image for a sattelitable publicity</i>.”
<p>Such is the work of medias: hide the proletariat and its struggle against
the capitalist society behind this show between Soros and the leftists,
between the IMF and <i>Attac</i>, between “globalisation” and “anti-globalisation”.
Hence another example, during the Nice summit, as accurately stated in
an internationally distributed pamphlet: “<i>The bourgeois press lied.
Lied shamelessly. According to it, the demonstrators against capitalist
globalisation joined the citizen parade, summoned by the European Trade
Union Confederation (ETUC). What more could these capitalists and rulers,
these spokesmen and lackeys long for, than seeing the proletarian youth
at war with capitalism, joining those misleading processions organized
by the legal opposition to the bourgeois system? In reality, in the streets
of Nice, two different, opposing, movements were discernible… Two movements
that so played their part: the first one, bourgeois (even though it still
drags along a good number of proletarians led astray), arrives as reinforcement
to the capitalist state, led by reformist leaders at the service of the
latter. The second, proletarian, denouncing capitalism ardently and attacking
its interests.</i>” (19)
<p>It appears extremely important to denounce, like many comrades and groups
standing against the current, the true opposition between the proletarian
movement and all this anti-summits and citizen celebrations, organized
by <i>Attac</i> and the like. However, to claim, as below in the leaflet,
that these two distinct demonstrations coincide with two different social
movements, one reformist and the other anti-capitalist, is to envisage
things in an absolute and insufficiently dialectic way. Indeed, despite
the obvious differences that distinguish those demonstrations, they both
contain the class contradiction. The social democrat one guides the proletarians
like docile sheep. The other one (that began 3 hours later), via its radical
mottos, tended towards proletarian rupture, but contained a whole range
of centrist positions and ideologies peculiar to social democracy, as we
shall see further. All this takes shape, for example, in the belief of
the vast majority of demonstrators, that they can confront capitalism without
confronting social democracy (constituent of capitalism) at the same time
and in the same way, or, despite their capacity to organize themselves
<i>outside</i>
social democracy, in their difficulties to organize <i>against</i> it.
<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">Official or parallel summits fever and falsehood
of the alternative bourgeois projects</font></u></h2>
These last years have seen the trend of summits and anti-summits rise and
make a qualitative step forward in simultaneity with the radicalisation
of the proletarian protests against them. Nowadays, organizing a summit
no longer consists solely of sorting out the general meetings, the commissions,
lodgement for those attending the congress or anti-congress, the official
celebrations and the democrat citizen ones organised by the “anti-globalisation
militants”. It is also necessary to anticipate the proletarian ruptures
and outflanking, and, consequently, to provide for specialised repressive
forces, prepare the reinforcement of border inspection, concentration of
shock troops, filming and broadcasting teams, specific services like bodyguards
for the congress or anti-congress personalities, troop transport vehicles,
tanks, anti-demonstration fences, and settling of the secret services from
all around the world. It also requires planning access or evacuation procedures
for the congress protagonists, in case the attacks would reach the official
centres, and the extraordinary mobilisation of medical services for the
wounded, as well as gathering weapons and gasses, and getting the confinement
cells and detention centres ready to welcome a large number of prisoners.
As an example, on the occasion of the IMF and World Bank congress of Prague,
no less than 170 policemen and 123 demonstrators were wounded, around 900
persons were arrested, while damage inflicted on private property amounted
a million dollars, which is after all fairly insignificant compared to
the real cost of these little meetings, which is said to include even potential
airborne evacuation of the main personalities as well as air and anti-missile
coverage of the zone. (20) Of course, all this information (along with
the inevitable distortions and falsifications) echoed all over the world,
giving the impression that we were indeed witnessing an historic conflict
of exceptional intensity, which for some is a battle between the supporters
of globalisation and the anti-globalisation ones, while some others see
it as a sort of capitalism versus anti-capitalism, international capital
versus international revolution conflict.
<p>Despite these clashes actually being a part of the all-time confrontation
between the preservation of the private property’s world and the proletarian
struggle for social revolution:
<ul>
<li>
to imagine that a balance of forces is presently being enforced that would
impede the development of capital’s current international policy, is to
be deeply unaware of capitalism own functioning;</li>

<li>
to imagine that it truly is a confrontation between two different projects
(neo-liberalism versus anti-neo-liberalism, globalisation versus anti-globalisation)
and that the bourgeois left-wing really has a distinct capitalist project,
also proves a total ignorance of the very essence of the bourgeois social
formation and a total misunderstanding of these capitalist factions conglomerate’s
function;</li>

<li>
and finally, to believe that, thanks to “direct action”, the proletariat
has at last found the path of proletarian internationalism, or as alleged
by some groups, that through these actions we are entering a phase of direct
confrontation between capitalist internationalism and proletarian internationalism,
not only evidences unawareness of capitalism’s functioning, but comes to
forget, deform, falsify the revolution’s program, the revolutionary strategy,
and inevitably leads to favouring confusion, by assuming a centrist role
(attempting to prevent the necessary rupture) within the proletarian movement.</li>
</ul>
Let us now provide some explanations about the two first points. The last
one is a matter of the proletariat’s own development and revolutionary
affirmation, and we shall bring it up in the following chapters.
<p>The international policy, nowadays called neo-liberal or “globalisation”,
does not have a long-term viable bourgeois alternative. This policy obeys
to the intrinsic rules of the system that has been global ever since it
has existed and that bases its functioning on the famous market’s “invisible
hand”, namely the rule of value. Contrarily to what is sometimes heard,
this is not “one” of capital’s policies, this is capitalism’s “natural”
implementation, and this is the rule that will ultimately impose itself.
The different so-called “alternative” economic policies can only, very
partially and in a limited way in time and/or space, correct or reduce
its enforcement. Populists (from Getulio Vargas to Peron, from Cardenas
to Nasser), the so-called socialist countries, but also fascism, Nazism,
Francoism… were its most durable expressions. These historic attempts to
affirm a different capitalist project on the long term (by restricting
the law of value’s application on account of protectionism) could only
have had limited duration, beyond which failure was inevitable.
<p>For those same reasons it is not possible to render “more human” a system
that is not. In the same way, there can be no environment-friendly capitalism,
or capitalism without wars. Whatever happened to the bourgeois “ecologic”
surge of awareness, for example, it did little to protect nature from the
mischief of capitalist’s production; on the contrary, it turned the “ecologic”
and “natural” into commodity. The constant search for maximum profitability
and the enterprises’ impressive adaptation abilities, ready to sell basically
anything under the ecologic label, make the capitalist dictatorship on
nature even harsher, and pose a threat for all species, and the human one
in particular. In the same way, it is absolutely impossible to pacify the
capitalist world, as the whole of the pacifist capitalist policies only
use peace as a war implement.
<p>Hiding this reality is more and more difficult. Capital’s catastrophe
has reached such proportions that the room for manoeuvre, that not so long
ago allowed implementing somewhat dissimilar economic policies, has shrunk:
capitalism nowadays tends irreversibly and globally to unify its policies;
both left-wing and right-wing make it clearer everyday, that there is only
one possible capitalist policy (and that’s what all leftists who accessed
power now persistently avow!). Thus, insofar as they have been co-opted
to take part in the decisions, the “anti-neo-liberals” and “anti-globalists”
from the opposition inevitably turn into “neo-liberals” and “pro-globalisation”
and are compelled to enforce the very opposite of what they had been defending
until then. Still, we cannot consider this is an expression of their free
will, or simply that they are just a bunch of cynical liars, because it
is indeed true that capitalism compels them to implement its own policy
in a much stronger way than these leftists had imagined.
<p>Along with capital’s expansion, the ability to moderate, at a regional
level, the international law of value’s enforcement has dwindled in time
and space. Ultra-protectionist capitalism, like the one that reigned during
numerous years in Russia, China, and Albania… is inconceivable nowadays.
The days of the Cuban capitalist regime and Castroist reactionary leaders
are now numbered. Stalinism, the ultra-reactionary model of capitalist
development (it seals its borders as an attempt to oppose the progress
of the productive forces’ development, international capital’s natural
tendency, the law of value), was not eradicated by democratic ideas or
because of its ruthless use of concentration camps (capitalism always made
use of them), but merely because the strict implementation of the law of
value cannot be indefinitely withheld. Indeed, the wider the gap between,
on one side, productive force’s worldwide development and the ensuing international
devalorisation, and on the other, the protectionist restriction of that
devalorisation in a given productive area, the faster the catastrophe and
socio-economic implosion of that area will occur (cf. what happened in
Eastern Europe).
<p>This process has been accelerating with the development of capital’s
contradictions, and it is more and more difficult to maintain, through
subsidization, the viability of certain productive areas and economic activity
sectors. From the local governments’ point of view, whose mission is to
offer the best rate of profit in order to attract capital (a policy always
in accordance with the international credit organisms and particularly
the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank), it means not only
to increase the exploitation rate as much as possible, but also to avoid
taxing lucrative sectors to finance non-lucrative sectors (redistribution
of profit). This process explains the tendency towards homogeneousness
of the wide-scale bourgeois policy. So, if bourgeois politicians still
deliver somewhat distinct speeches (and even then, less and less!), when
it comes to governing, they all implement, with a few variations, the International
Monetary Fund’s policy. This is one of the reasons for the so-called “betrayal”
of leftists who accessed government and in conclusion enforce a “right-wing
policy”, or ecologists who finally end up supporting the national and international
war effort (NATO’s included), and, more globally, the destruction of the
planet and human life. If they implement a “right-wing” policy, it’s because,
from capital’s point of view, it’s the only valid one (21): it is necessary
to generate profit and attract capital on the basis of that profitability.
If some differences in the speeches still remain, it is not as a reflection
of true differences between economic policies, but rather because on certain
occasions, facing the proletariat, only in the name of left-wing or ecology
can austerity measures be enforced.
<p>That’s why, even from the capitalist’s point of view, nothing else is
to be expected from this conglomerate of factions, which, in their speeches,
blame the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. These bourgeois
factions only differ in the manner they intend to channel the proletarians
who, under unceasing attack by the progresses of capitalism, grow a sort
of nostalgia for a “less aggressive and less destructive” world, forever
gone. (22) This idiotic nostalgia induces the na&iuml;ve desire to protect
local production, relieved from the domination of these gigantic international
enterprises, which, without scruples, destroy everything in the name of
capital. It is no project but the typical helpless lamentation of local
and “more ecologic” management. A leaflet, from the Spanish CNT of Barcelona,
dated from the 23<sup>rd</sup> of September 2000, was concluded precisely
on this motto, perfect expression of the ideological, utopian and reactionary
claims of this bundle of “anti-globalist” bourgeois factions: “<i>Support
to local, ecologic and self-ruled economy</i>”.
<p>Furthermore, it is obvious that the development of these pseudo-projects
constitutes the ideological expression of various bourgeois factions’ protectionist
interests, particular and localist ones, which, as such, promote the imperialistic
struggle (and wars). Therefore, it is not a matter, despite the content
of their speeches, of achieving a “more human capitalism” –capitalism is
and has always been inhuman and the antagonism between capitalism and humanity
can only grow worse-, it is all about containing the proletariat with these
reactionary utopias and exhorting it to the defence of their local, regional,
national interests… No wonder then, that in many countries, the extreme
right wing declares itself in favour of the “anti-globalisation”. Its real
intent is, of course, to regain credibility in the eyes of the exploited
and channel the growing proletarian rage towards the way things are going
on around the planet into the grounds of the inter-bourgeois struggle,
of the imperialistic war.
<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">Role of the proletariat in the circus of
summits and its drifts: question of the proletarian autonomy</font></u></h2>
This whole show of summits and anti-summits aims to present the protests
of Davos, Seattle, Prague, and Genoa... as the real alternative to the
present world. Even outside the overtly social democrat factions, it is
of good taste to consider these days when summits, street battles… take
place, as the very essence of the struggle, found at last, that would oppose
the present development of capitalism, as the quintessence of proletarian
internationalism. In this chapter we will therefore focus on the role currently
assigned to the action of the proletariat within these summits, with the
aim to specify our interests and to define the proletarian policy to adopt
facing this big circus.
<p>In order to go deeper into this question, it is essential to analyse
the issue of the difference existing between the way the struggle of our
class expresses itself against the summits and anti-summits, and the proletarian
struggles that, as we said, are currently characterised by abrupt qualitative
leaps (although sporadic and without continuity), by extremely violent
struggles that attack the whole political spectrum and that develop out
of any mediation, as it happened these last years in Romania, Venezuela,
Albania, Algeria… or more recently, in Indonesia, Ecuador… It is necessary
to analyse the issue of the existing interaction between each of these
struggles, proletarian ways of expression.
<p>As an example, and to make the global understanding easier, let’s compare
the struggles that took place in Seattle, with those that occurred, in
early 2000, in Ecuador. In both cases entire factions of the proletariat
confronted capital, thousands of proletarians opposed the different national
and international structures of the world capitalistic state. In both cases
they confronted the repressive corps that protect private property, as
well as capital’s decisional centres. In both cases they fought the local
leaders as well as the international leaders of capital.
<p>Let’s now proceed while insisting on the differences. (23) Although
we make this comparison in order to oppose some subtler conceptions, we’ll
start by emphasizing the most stupid and short-sighted prejudices derived
from the social democrat ideology. According to the vision of <i>Attac</i>
and Co, the struggles in each country cannot go further because the decisional
centres of capital, or better said of financial capital, are the World
Bank and the IMF, and it is at the time of summit meetings that these institutions
decide the fate of the planet. <i>Attac</i> and Co do not therefore recognise
that the proletarian movement is the same in Seattle as it is in Ecuador.
But even if they would accept this idea they would pretend that in Seattle
the movement is international and decisive, whereas in Ecuador it is local,
indigenous, economicist and without great impact. In essence, they would
state that it is thanks to the protests in Seattle, Davos, and Washington…
that attack the centre of the system that capitalism faces difficulties
in imposing the measures, recommended by the World Bank and the International
Monetary Fund.
<p>We counter this by insisting that in Ecuador proletarians confronted
not only the local bourgeoisie, but also the international bourgeoisie.
Through its action the proletariat opposed the austerity plans sponsored
by these famous institutions such as the International Monetary Fund and
the World Bank. The generalisation of this movement would have allowed
to impose an international balance of forces which would have called into
question any increase in the rate of exploitation; its qualitative development
would have called into question the exploitation itself. Contrary to this
the only thing that the proletarian movement fighting against the summits
and anti-summits, against the plans of the IMF, etc. can be expected to
achieve is that these meetings do not take place, that the delegates to
these congresses, or more generally the representatives of world capitalism,
are hindered by terror. But it will not prevent decisions being taken.
This will be done discreetly, without fanfare, in secret alcoves or through
“confidential” inter-bourgeois contacts… But one way or another, the decisions
will be taken!
<p>Although the actions such as the ones that took place in Ecuador, are
geographically limited, they are capable (a large number of historic examples
is testament to this) of imposing an international balance of forces against
capital, to freeze the measures attacking the proletariat (as in Bolivia
where the measures about the running water that national and international
capital wanted to impose have since been withdrawn).
<p>On the other hand, the action in Seattle, although more general and
certainly more spectacular, is nevertheless incapable of imposing a balance
of forces allowing, for example, a prevention of an increase of the rate
of exploitation.
<p>The adjournment of the meeting of the World Bank in Barcelona, planned
for June 2001, incited our enemies to call it a triumph. As far as we are
concerned, we consider that even if one succeeds in eliminating all the
conferences from the surface of the earth, even if one destroys the whole
of the buildings housing the meetings of these international organisms,
one would not succeed in preventing the implementation of the measures,
country by country. It is necessary to clearly affirm it in order to refute
the opposing myth. This does not at all depreciate the struggle of the
proletarians against the summits and anti-summits, struggles that inspire
a real panic to the delegates attending these congresses, the cops, the
governments and the social democrats. As we will see later, these sectors
of the proletariat could play a decisive role in the generalisation of
the struggle, in the consciousness and the international direction of the
movement.
<p>Let’s therefore proceed with our comparison. In Ecuador this movement
is the result of a set of partial struggles, led by different sectors of
the proletariat in order to defend their interests against “their own”
bourgeoisie, “their own” trade unionists, “their own” social democrat parties…
In the beginning the requirements were different, then the discontent grew
and spread. The proletarian struggle occupied the street and the particular
demands became generalised. (24) Decisional centres of the state (parliament,
judicial power, presidency, places of meetings for political parties…)
were attacked.
<p>In Seattle, the movement was composed of those who want to attack what
they consider to be the decisional centres of capital and the world state.
And this is true for the proletarians who walk like good little sheep in
social democrat processions as well as for those who outflank them and
who will confront social democracy, getting organised outside it, and often
even against it. The starting point of the proletarians who went to Seattle
is apparently more global, more politicised (25) and more determined by
the political will than by the immediate interest, the social interest.
They start from their positions, from their revolutionary ideas, even though
these are, in turn, the result of the consciousness of the generalised
immediate interests of the proletariat.
<p>Through its opposition to the expressions of capital and the state,
the movement in Ecuador, social product of the proletarian interests becoming
widespread, directly contains, represents and assumes the interests of
the international proletariat against capital and the world state. The
consequent struggle for their interests led the proletarians to practically
oppose the attempts of social democrat containment, despite what the protagonists
might think. In Ecuador the proletarian movement, whose interests emerged
and developed with this movement, was urged to break away from any of social
democrat containment. In Seattle, on the contrary, only the political positions
and the programmatical clarity allow to develop and to deepen the break
from social democracy.
<p>In Ecuador the proletariat was only able to defend the interests for
which the movement started, if it breaks away from the social democrat
containment and assumes its class autonomy. When it decided to go to Quito,
considered to be a decisional centre of capital, it’s because it can’t
stand it any longer, because it wanted to get rid of those who starve it.
It was an attack! Because everybody advised to stay quiet and “to go back
home”. Nobody invited these proletarians to Quito, and there is neither
a summit, nor an anti-summit to “welcome” them. Only the police will be
there and will first do its best to prevent them from reaching capital
city. And in spite of this the proletariat will impose its determination.
The trade union containment and the bourgeois left will try to jump on
the bandwagon, but they’ll only just manage to follow it.
<p>On the other hand, in Seattle, the summits triggered the movement. The
places and dates of the gathering are determined according to the summits.
This was not a proletarian force, which decided to go to Seattle; proletarians
were invited to participate like a submissive herd in processions whose
planning is based on the meetings’ schedule. Besides these processions,
and to a certain extent outside and against them, there were groups of
proletarians ready to fight against this containment. Of course, these
groups were not invited… and they were rather feared. It was against them
that the repressive forces were organised. It was because of them that
the checking at the borders was reinforced. These proletarian factions
ready to fight this framework went to Seattle for their programmatical
positions. They were going there to mark and develop their refusal of capital
as a whole. Only the perception of the interests of the international proletariat,
transformed into class-consciousness and into positions (filtered by the
bourgeois ideology, in spite of a struggle against it), would allow them
to oppose social democracy and to develop the proletarian autonomy. Moreover,
the majority of the proletarians who went to Seattle in order to develop
the proletarian struggle belonged to an organisation, a network (very fashionable
expression nowadays), a movement, a group or were considered as part of
their organised periphery.
<p>This makes a considerable distinction between both examples. In Ecuador
the breaking was determined by the unavoidable development of antagonistic
interests. In Seattle it depended almost exclusively on the programs and
flags of the groups present. This determined that, during events such as
Seattle, the political discussion with the groups and the participating
organisations acquired great importance. In the same way, the programmatical
critique of the organisations which pretended to develop and urge a proletarian
rupture became decisive as well as the denunciation of all centrist ideologies
that prevented the rupture and/or that wanted to push forward the proletariat
while giving a more violent character to the protest of the bourgeois left
in the name of the limits of the proletarian consciousness. As we will
see later, the fact of giving the bourgeois left wing a more violent character
cannot constitute on any account the action program of the proletariat.
<p>The comradely critique we have for these expressions is part and parcel
of the rupture movement that is currently developing, whether it is in
Seattle, in Ecuador or anywhere else in the world. Despite the differences
we emphasised in this or that case, it is still one and the same movement,
whose practice we assume. This is our movement,… our world fight against
capital. But when from the inside we try to make a critical balance sheet
of the strengths and weaknesses of a movement like the one in Ecuador,
we feel that its important aspect lies in its practical dynamics and not
in the analysis of the flags, groups and positions, which we consider in
this case as being secondary. On the other hand, in Seattle, as the political
positions were the starting point for this gathering of forces, their analysis
and their critique must be taken into consideration without forgetting
that, there too, the autonomous struggle of the international proletariat
is at stake, against the bourgeois society and all the recycling proposed
by the left wing. In the following chapters we shall analyse how, during
these summits, the struggle for the autonomy of the proletariat tries to
take shape and we shall give priority to the political positions of the
protagonists over their autonomy in every street demonstration.
<p>However, before starting this analysis, it seems imperative to specify
that the autonomy in the street is extremely important, and this is why
the motto “outside and against the summits and anti-summits" as well as
the critique of proletarians marching like good little sheep is fundamental.
The Internationalist Communist Group, through several leaflets and propaganda
actions, clearly expressed this position during these struggles.
<p>It is just as fundamental (and we endorse this as we can) to criticise
the practice of the radical columns of these demonstrations, in order to
urge them not to participate in these social democrat processions anymore,
even to “outflank the demonstration” or to “radicalise it”. Seeing that
in such circumstances the proletarian rupture can only take place through
the programmatical rupture, through the programmatical and organisative
advance of the most radical factions, we are now going to focus on the
programmatical positions expressed at the time of these demonstrations.
<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">Class violence: revolutionaries or activists
and opportunists?</font></u></h2>
Let’s now consider in depth the ground of the classist rupture. Let’s leave
the bleating sheep and concentrate on the radical proletarian fringes we
are interested in, on the closest militants or groups of militants, those
who go to these demonstrations to confront capital and the state, those
who consider that it is decisive to attack social democracy, those who
say they are revolutionaries and are present there to develop the revolutionary
struggle.
<p>It is clear that to consider oneself as revolutionary expresses a real
qualitative leap: it means to assume in a voluntary, organised and conscious
way an activity aimed at the destruction of capitalism and the state. We
have to point out, in order to reiterate the previous comparison, that
when the movement in Ecuador decreases, there remains, in the best case
only a few small cores of revolutionary militants who try to draw the lessons
and to establish contact with other revolutionaries throughout the world.
In Seattle on the contrary, minorities already exist, organised in a permanent
way and that will give continuity to their organisation independently of
the summits, and this constitutes an extremely important affirmation of
the tendency of the proletariat to get organised as a force and as a historic
affirmation of the revolutionary militancy. We are part of this process
and within this it seems essential to us to practice the comrade critique.
<p>One doesn’t become revolutionary by a single act of will, but according
to his social practice, the practical role he plays, what he defends in
practice. This is valid for militants as well as for the political organisations.
It is the social practice, the real social project that positions a group,
a militant, on one side or the other of the barricade.
<p>History is full of examples of organisations that on behalf of revolution
defended counter-revolution, of national and international political structures
that on behalf of socialism, communism and/or anarchism defended precisely
the opposite: capitalism and its state. At the root of all opportunisms,
of all renunciations of the program of revolution, one always finds, as
a decisive factor of the treason, the ideology of the “lesser evil”, the
“realistic” politics, “we don’t have to fright the proletariat with radical
propositions”, “the masses would not understand”, the need to proceed “step
by step”, the dissolution of the revolutionary program “to go where the
masses are”, and finally, the replacement of the communist program by a
set of partial reforms or bridge-programs that always lead to the defence
of capital. In order to prevail, the counter-revolution always uses the
same artifices, and these are not very numerous. This is why it is important
to analyse the struggles of the past and to draw lessons from them.
<p>Within the organisations and groups present in Davos, Seattle, Prague…
in the pamphlets, leaflets and publications as well as in the discussions,
what we see in the first place is that, for those who pretend to be revolutionaries,
the main unifying and demarcating element is to assume and claim class
violence, and naturally, organised violence of the class minorities. (26)
Against the ideology of “non-violence”, so widespread in the official processions
and that eases the cops’ job since it allows the police to put on file,
to gas, to humiliate and beat up thousands of human beings without triggering
any reaction from their part, it is logical and very important that groups
that claim revolution assume and exhort to revolutionary violence. It is
an invariant necessity, a basic element of the rupture with the social
democrat ideology and, at an international level, an objective affirmation
of the proletarian tendency to break up with theoricism and lounge lizard
ideologists.
<p>Socially assuming violence, as an elementary phenomenon, as an indispensable
human necessity against the society of capital, reappears on the agenda
in all of the proletariat movements. It is obvious that international awareness
of the necessity of class minority violence against the social democrat
pacifist ideology is rising. This awareness is and will be decisive for
the structuring of the proletariat as a worldwide force. This present tendency
is determined by the exacerbation of all the contradictions of capital,
and also by the action and the denunciation that we have put forward for
decades like so many other revolutionary minorities. We emphasize this
because it is a strong point of the movement and its vanguard expressions
present in Seattle, in Ecuador, in Paris, in Moscow…
<p>Today like yesterday, any group or organisation that is opposed to the
proletarian minorities’ violence while putting forward antisubstitutionism,
antiterrorism, the mythical “class violence as a whole”, belongs in fact
to social democracy and to the bourgeois state.
<p>However, violence alone cannot be considered as a sufficient element
of a rupture. Considered separately, in itself, it does not allow a setting
up of a demarcation line between reform and revolution, as the bourgeois
left wing tries to make us believe. Between reform (that also uses violence
to defend the system) and revolution, there is a class abyss concerning
social project and program. The proletariat has to practically organise
itself outside and against social democracy, and delimitate as clearly
as possible the opposing sides. The practical affirmation of the proletariat
as an independent class simultaneously implies a theoretical definition
of methods and objectives clearly demarcating from the bourgeois forces.
To believe that this demarcation can exclusively occur on the basis of
opposition between violence and non-violence, is absolutely insufficient
and leads to confusion.
<p>However, within the movement against the summits, there is a great disregard
for the revolutionary theory, for the program of the destruction of capitalism,
for the struggle in favour of precise programmatical agreements, for the
question of the party and the question of power. Thus, in the shade of
social democracy and as violent expression of its being, an ideology has
grown that denies or minimises the importance of these issues on behalf
of freedom or “libertarian mood”, of “direct action” and “revolutionary
practice”. This conception is based on “activity”, “the practicality”,
and
unity coming through “the struggles in the street”. We mercilessly criticise
this conception because it always leads to opportunism.
<p>Firstly, denying the importance of revolutionary theory and programmatical
discussion obviously constitutes a very precise “revolutionary” theory,
even if its supporters deny this. The refusal to define the revolutionary
program of the proletariat, combined with the apology of “direct action”
in the immediate activity and “libertarianism” in the political sphere,
is a very concrete program and is nothing new. Opportunists of the 19<sup>th</sup>
and early 20<sup>th</sup> century, starting with Bernstein himself, already
based their concept on this maxim: “the final goal is nothing, the movement
is everything”.
<p>Even worse, this movementism, this empiricism feels confident and strong
because it is capable of leading masses to action, without frightening
them with positions such as the necessary dictatorship of the proletariat
for the abolition of wage labour. However, from the point of view of the
proletariat, this lack of direction, of program and perspective, of permanent
organisation and this failure to assume the necessity to get centralised,
constitutes a great historic weakness allowing, once more, our manipulation.
From the point of view of the groups that support and urge this empiric
and antiprogrammatical practice, it’s an open door to opportunism, frontism,
to the ideology of the lesser evil, and in general, to falling into social
democracy, on the grounds of the counter-revolution.
<p>Considering the current characteristics of the proletarian struggles
around the world, what the movement is precisely lacking is perspective,
continuity, revolutionary direction, insurrectionary preparation, which
means affirmation of a force aware of where it is heading to, that fights
to acquire a centralisation and a direction. The proletariat affirms itself
as a class only when it violently and abruptly reappears in the struggle,
a fact that today is geographically very limited. At the present time,
this is the great weakness of our class: it is incapable of recognising
itself in the struggles that occur at the other end of the planet. It is
as if, every time, the movement starts from scratch again, without having
accumulated any historical experience. To not consider itself as a world
class, to not recognise its own past, generates the inability to affirm
(and, worse still, to be aware of) the program of the destruction of capitalism.
For that reason the libertarian, practicist, movementist… ideologies, which
all together oppose “direct action” to the revolutionary program, are today
more harmful than ever. They have taken up the role of the opportunists
of the past: to prevent the revolutionary rupture with social democracy.
<p>The fact that these groups and organisations consider themselves as
revolutionary is not enough to rank them among the revolutionaries. Indeed,
their real practice consists precisely in defending this empirical ideology,
this revolutionary anti-theory that always marches hand in hand with the
activist practice.
<p>The majority of these militants who pretend to be revolutionaries consider
that the central activity of the revolution consists in agitating, activating,
arousing the struggle of the proletariat, leading permanent campaigns against
such or such multinational or institution of capital and of course against
the bourgeois summits. We don’t criticise the fact that these activists
consider themselves as revolution professionals, that they get organised
and try with all their heart to develop the revolution; we criticise the
fact that, according to them, revolution would result, not from the historic
struggles of a social class, but from the generalisation of their actions,
from this activism. (27) This ideology based on the specificity of the
agitation action, of the recruitment in its favour and on the illusion
of the capacity to destroy capitalism thanks to the generalisation of activism
(some go as far as associating victory with the number of busses bringing
activists to the next summit), clearly indicates an ignorance and an objective
contempt not only for the historical movement to which these groups belong,
but especially regarding the existing relation between the struggles they
lead and other present or past proletarian struggles, that is to say regarding
the revolutionary program. Activism thus closes its eyes to the historic
arch of the communist struggle against capital; it defends “activity” against
revolutionary theory, “direct action” against the necessity to get organised
as a political force, a revolutionary party, a centralised force for the
abolition of capitalistic social order. Even when it refers to organisation,
activism never considers constituting itself as a worldwide force, developing
permanency and centralisation: the worldwide party. It refers on the contrary
to informal networks, to unity through action, to agreements on such campaigns.
While repeating the old social democrat separation between practice and
theory, while depreciating theory and pretending to act on behalf of the
masses, of the will of those who struggle, of workers’ democracy… activism
always leads to the degeneration of political groups. These worshippers
of immediatism end up running behind the masses and sacrificing the essence
of the revolutionary program.
<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">Revolutionary International? Activist lie!</font></u></h2>
Activism originates in the concept according to which the revolutionary
International constitutes itself on the basis of immediate action. Nowadays,
several groups that question the classic social democrat positions participate
in the circus of summits and anti-summits, in their propaganda; they assert
it is about a confrontation between the capitalist International and the
revolutionary International. As an example the international secretary
of the FSA-IWA has no hesitation in titling his document about Prague:
“The Capitalist International against the Anarcho-Syndicalist International”.
<p>In spite of the power of certain confrontations of our class against
the summits and anti-summits, in spite of the violence of outflanking movements
and confrontations against the police, in spite of the broken shop windows,
etc. it is totally inadequate to refer to this as a revolutionary International.
A revolutionary International is much more than all this, not only in quantitative
terms related to the expressions of violence, but also in qualitative terms.
To glorify these proletarian actions and to identify them with a revolutionary
International constitutes a gross distortion of facts and brings forth
a completely false picture of what a revolutionary International must be,
and this, for different reasons.
<p>The first is that the degree of autonomy of the proletariat remains
very relative. Above all because the proletariat does not determine the
places, dates and conditions of the confrontations; they are imposed on
it by the class enemy (28) and settled at the time of the summits and/or
the parallel summits. And even if trying to prevent their realisation or
demonstrating against them is a part of the protest, one cannot speak about
autonomy of action if one is entirely dependant on these summits to appear
and demonstrate.
<p>And indeed, several groups and militants draw the following lessons
from Seattle: “it is not necessary to throw oneself into the lion’s jaws”,
“it is our decision of where, when and how we will demonstrate”. (29) Becoming
aware of this reality constitutes one of the strongest aspects, developed
by the minorities that urge violent action, and several organisations and
groups state the necessity to get organised apart from the circus of the
summits and anti-summits. Different associations, networks and assemblies
begin to claim this objective, shaping thus the embryo of a community of
struggle that could be decisive in the future and could foreshadow through
its practice, the direction the proletariat needs.
<p>However, and it is necessary to affirm this very clearly, at the time
of these summits, even though class violence develops, the degree of autonomy
of the proletariat remains weak, extremely weak. This is of great relief
for the cops in their work of preparation and knowledge of the ground in
case of “combat” as well as in order to set up cameras, to film, to put
on file and to identify “the more dangerous elements”.
<p>The bourgeoisie has already achieved important successes at the time
of such operations. We have to note the excellent division of work that
has been achieved, in order to channel, to scatter and to repress the proletariat:
a maximum of people are invited, numbed by sheep-like strolls behind the
inevitable pacifist groups; and it is made sure that the “nasty” ones are
channelled into processions apart from the main stream or under different
colours, with the declared objective to express themselves through violence
and to smash shop windows, obviously making the police’s action easier.
Sleep therapy for the great majority, truncheons and filings for those
who look for confrontation, this is how our enemies work in order to divide
the proletariat. This is like filtering the movement, selecting and identifying
perfectly those to be put on file, and those to be arrested.
<p>The predominant ideology in a large number of these activist groups
makes this division of work easier. The fact that they don’t define themselves
outside and against the official processions of protests and that large
numbers agree to form other columns within these same processions is a
contribution towards the state’s action. Moreover, in some cases, those
who take the head of the outflanking actions are none other than the “youth
sections” of leftist groups or factions of social democracy (Maoist, Trotskyites,
guerrillerists…) who obviously do not stand against social democracy, against
the propositions aiming to humanise capitalism, but through their so-called
“radical” actions (spectacular, in fact) actually give a greater credibility
to social democracy. (30)
<p>Things would be different if the most determined sectors of the proletariat
acted to prevent this division of work, if they rejected the separation
between those who parade gently and the “hooligans”, if they organised
violence in order to fight processions and official protests and to bring
thus the whole of the proletarians to violently protest and confront not
only the official police, but also the trade-union and left wing cops who,
in collaboration with the first, guarantee the division of work and state
terrorism.
<p>One may retort that the balance of forces is not in our favour to face
the left wing bourgeoisie, that shock troops of the left wing and the trade-union
cops still guarantee the peaceful order in their demonstrations, but these
affirmations do nothing but confirm the lack of autonomy we referred to
above.
<p>This shows that the ideology dominant in this milieu is the one of the
lesser evil; it shows that, because of this ideology, the organisation
of the proletarian violence never overtly expresses itself against social
democracy and the anti-summits but always against the right wing and the
official summits; it shows that, because of this ideology, the organisation
of the proletarian violence forms itself on the social democratic grounds
(as if the proletariat could conquer its autonomy in such way!) and that
it breaks out not against social democracy (that is on the whole rather
unaffected, despite verbal criticism blaming it for “pacifism and other
deviations”), but against the rampart which protects the bourgeoisie: the
official police. (31)
<p>All this is a matter of bourgeois leftism and clearly aims at diverting
the proletariat from its society’s critique. A revolutionary direction
must fight for the opposite, to prevent the division of work carried out
by the bourgeoisie with anaesthetising speeches and processions, with truncheons
and police files, from being crowned with success. Rather than confronting
super-trained policemen who are just expecting for it, it would be more
judicious to attack the social democrats by surprise, clearly less prepared,
or to fight policemen when they do not expect it and when we decide it.
To walk along social democracy or into different coloured columns, but
still in its wake, to give radicalism to these demonstrations, has a catastrophic
result for the proletariat. It is necessary to get organised outside and
against these social democrat processions, to constitute oneself as a force
to stand in their way, and to prevent them from achieving their forums
like in Porto Alegre. To structure the proletarian force, to choose our
own objectives, to stop considering, as <i>Attac</i> and the forum of Porto
Alegre do, that the enemy is the World Bank and the International Monetary
Fund, that’s what will be decisive for the future.
<p>To confront the same objectives as social democracy, even in a violent
and radical way, is falling into the ideology of the lesser evil and accepting
the frontism, principle that, in the name of antifascism, led the Marxists-Leninists
as well as the anarcho-syndicalists and the Trotskyites, to stand for the
bourgeois state against the revolution (first in 1936/37 in Spain, and
then everywhere around the world).
<p>Until now, only one thing seems to matter: to prevent, through violence,
the meetings of the International Monetary Fund, of the World Bank… No
mention is ever made of the meetings of <i>Attac</i>, or the Socialist
International or the Social Forums, and this brings to the fore the weakness
of our class and, especially, the predominance of centrism, even in the
most radical demonstrations of the proletariat.
<p>In these demonstrations, and in spite of the presence of columns under
different colours, the proletariat associates itself with social democracy
and marches alone against the enemies of social democracy, revealing that
we are still at the very beginning of the class autonomy process. The proletariat,
in order to autonomise itself, must also break from the so-called “autonomists”
who lead it in these processions and citizen celebrations, organised by
the social democrats (even if it is to radicalise them) that prevent our
class from achieving real autonomy.
<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">Urban guerrilla warfare? Insurrection?</font></u></h2>
Some people also claim that this kind of confrontation corresponds to a
certain extent with “urban guerrilla warfare, a kind of insurrection or
insurrectionary practice”. This concept could be interesting if, in reality,
it was organised on a basis of its own which is currently not the case.
The real insurrectionary revolutionary struggle cannot be based on going
to where the repression forces await and stand ready to give us a beating,
nor on confronting a hyper-prepared enemy who’s just waiting for it. It’s
a good old scenario: the bourgeoisie and the repression leaders send in
a troop of over-trained mercenaries against which we come a cropper while
they remain safely under cover. What else could they wish better than seeing
our force bumping into the shield walls that protect them while they remain
unscathed?
<p>Moreover, the laws of insurrection are precisely the opposite of this
scenario: concentration of proletarian forces against an enemy who’s not
expecting it; choice of the place and the moment according to the objectives,
attack where and when we are less awaited; denial of military-type combat
when the odds are unfavourable; spread deceptive rumours of an attack date,
and act before, when the enemy isn’t ready yet, or after, when he is tired
of waiting; avoid getting stuck into a resistance based upon static strong
points; disperse facing an advancing enemy and regroup for surprise counter-attacks;
make barracks unusable as well as other places where troops are confined
and concentrated to ensure their obedience; hit the capitalists, the governors
and the heads of the repression in their homes, prevent them from directing
the repressive terrorist operations either by capturing them, isolating
them, or somehow hindering their ability to command…
<p>Let’s go even further: from the point of view of the insurrection we
have no interest in confronting and destroying policemen as such (even
though we’ll show no mercy for any agent of law and order who enforces
terror!), what is necessary is the destruction of the coherence of the
repression corps (appeal for turning their guns against their officers);
to confront the forces used as rampart by the bourgeoisie as a whole does
nothing but stiffen their famous esprit de corps.
<p>This is why the “guerrillerist conception” that is nowadays so fashionable
deserves all our criticism. This conception presents a caricature of the
guerrilla warfare while inciting to the struggle apparatus against apparatus,
always favourable to the state. It seems that the “head of insurrectionary
operations” –maybe because of the lack of revolutionary perspectives- takes
pride in the amount of wounded policemen as well as the number of people
put on police files and injured in our ranks. Reports from leftist bourgeois
circulating around the Internet and on video, keep track of the number
of injured and glorify the spectacular pictures of confrontations, pretending
that’s how the social revolution gains ground. A mere consultation of sites
like Indymedia is enough to have an idea of the craze for “action” and
“revolt” pictures trading that has taken hold of the activist milieu, and
of the way of which they deal with this, which, finally, only benefits
spectacle… and the police.
<p>The revolutionary struggle will generate injuries, prisoners and deaths
among proletarians, but it’s in our interest that they are as few as possible.
We already have too many victims! All historic examples clearly indicate
that when a proletarian insurrection unfolds, there are not too many victims,
and that when the heads of the repression and the bourgeois state are directly
attacked; the number of fallen comrades remains limited. Inversely, the
number of victims rises as soon as one calls to resist or to demonstrate
against the repressive power of the state. (32)
<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">Lack of revolutionary program, the violence
exhibition</font></u></h2>
What we just described is another expression of the lack of program and
revolutionary perspectives in these confrontations. It is indicative of
the absence of a true and deep criticism of the bourgeois society and the
non-existence of a strategy aimed at destroying the capitalist society.
Hence, to speak of a revolutionary International standing against a capital
International amounts to falsify the very nature of a revolutionary International.
What revolutionary International do they refer to? To these bright red
or azure blue columns, these colourful groups that all join in the same
social democrat parade? What makes these columns different from the ones
that openly claim their social democrat allegiance? The mere fact that
they confront the IMF or WB monsters through the use of violence?
<p>The international secretary of the FSA-IWA feels no shame in declaring
that his group, the <i>blue block</i>, must show to the poor people all
around the world –via television (33)- that in Europe, there are people
who fight against the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank: “<i>It
was a class war rampant tornado, we knew that was not the usual way we
operate, but we all knew that we had to show the poor and moribund proletarians
from all over the world that here, in Europe, there are courageous people
who not only criticize and condemn, but also do not fear to confront physically
to the IMF and the WB, who are determined to impede their congresses, who
risk their lives and health to put an end to the macabre deeds of the hunger
and ecological destruction’s engineers</i>.”
<p>We see to what point this violence is framed, in a trade union manner,
to make sure transgressions aren’t directed against the bourgeois left
wing. However, when the proletarian protest is not contained by trade unionists
(whether they call themselves libertarian or anarcho-syndicalists), things
transpire very differently, and, as it happened in Kabylia, Algeria, the
press is forced to admit that the rioters display aggression to both official
parties and opposition ones. (34) Quite remarkable as well is the complacency
with which these pretentious individuals distinguish the specialists of
social change, the anarcho-syndicalists, from the proletarians of the whole
world. We shall also note the euro-racist distinction applied to the decisive
character of whatever happens in Europe, and the rest of the world where
there is nothing more than misery and submission. As if the proletarians
of the rest of the world were nothing but ghosts, whose sole hope relies
on these European trade-unionist gentlemen to show them the way! It is
one of the most colossal falsifications of our times!
<p>And the secretary of the FSA continues: “<i>But the streets at war have
proven very surprising compared to what happens normally. Little by little,
those who, with great courage, charged into the police ranks have gained
recognition, and it was noticed that, in those instances, capital and state
forces were not attacked by punks, hooligans, or disillusioned adolescents,
in short by turbulent passers-by without any political sense; right in
the middle of these groups of assailants, red and black flags were everywhere
to be seen, as well as shields and gas masks bearing the AIT-IWA acronym.</i>”
And to make it perfectly clear that we’re not dealing here with real transgressive
action, with private property destruction, as it occurs when the proletariat
assails the bourgeoisie forces as a whole, to insist on the fact that it
is merely an attack directed against the right wing, the secretary of the
FSA proceeds, as if providing an excuse: “<i>It is not our way of doing
(…) but confronted to the fact that 10,000 politicians and economists were
congregating in the centre of Prague, negotiating and planning misery and
death for millions of people, that was perhaps the only thing we could
do. It should be the politicians and the economists who feel ashamed for
the material and personal damage that occurred, not the valorous revolutionaries
of the ‘Red and Black’ block, who have demonstrate, in the Lumir street,
that Seattle is no more a valid symbol. The new symbol is right here, it's
Prague!</i>”
<p>This has nothing to do, then, with a revolutionary International against
capital. Nothing to do with a proletarian organisation whose elementary
task should be, on the contrary, to bring to light the role of both the
left wing and the right wing of capitalism, to prove that attacking the
International Monetary Fund without also targeting its indispensable complements
such as <i>Attac</i> &amp; Co. ends up contributing to the strengthening
of the proletariat’s enemies. The revolutionary International will organise
its practice outside and against social democrat manifestations and will
not solely confront a specific faction of capital, since it only fortifies
it, but will oppose capital as a whole.
<p>It is of course necessary to define objectives as clearly as possible.
We need to affirm the proletariat’s struggle against capital, without excluding
social democracy, which is capital’s branch devoted to taming the proletarians.
In Seattle, Prague, Buenos Aires… we met groups of proletarians that brandish
such mottos, but the proletariat’s lack of political and organisational
autonomy leads to the re-appearance, even among the most advanced sectors,
of unionist slogans which, despite blaming capital, play nonetheless by
its rules. The most “intense” slogan, quoted from the <i>blue block </i>in
Prague was, according to the secretary of the FSA: “<i>Against capital,
anarcho-syndicalist labour!</i>”
<p>Today, what we proletarians need most is to build up a class associationism,
which has nothing to do with trade unions (whether self-proclaimed anarchist
or not!). We need to affirm the core of the revolutionary program, the
struggle for the international proletarian revolution, the central question
of the struggle against state’s power, the struggle for its destruction,
the proletarian insurrection, the dictatorship against the market and the
rate of profit. To speak of a revolutionary International without including
these fundamental elements seems to us counter-productive and deceitful
and we assert it serves no other than the reactionary forces. That some
do so deliberately and others sincerely think they serve the revolution’s
cause is actually of little concern!
<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">About the critique of false ruptures: proletarian
rupture against centrism</font></u></h2>
Before proceeding with our critique on the essential question of false
ruptures, let’s replace it in the present context of the balance of forces
between classes. In all this circus of summits and colourful demonstrations,
the guest of honour, invited to applaud and to walk in the official processions,
is the proletariat.
<p>As the imposture is too gross, as those who claim to stand at the head
of the demonstrations remain the same faces, the same structures, the same
social democrat programs, and although they still succeed in subjugating
a large number of proletarians (sheep will always exist), the proletariat
outflanks them and tends, as it autonomises itself to stand outside and
against these citizens citizen celebrations.
<p>But this splitting is not done overnight. Its affirmations still remain
partial, and the weakness of our class in its rupture allows different
social democrat factions to interpret, to channel the splitting and especially
to prevent it from being total. Obviously, these factions that take over
decisive points of the communist critique and pretend to defend the revolution,
try by all means to enchain the proletariat, to make it dependent and to
maintain it under the social democrat yoke. This is the classic role of
factions that revolutionaries point out as being centrists because, although
they take over some fundamental points of the revolutionary program, they
hinder the indispensable qualitative leap that consists precisely in standing
outside and against any capitalistic organisation.
<p>Nowadays like before, centrism stands against the old opportunism and
revisionism of social democracy that claim that a development of capital
would be favourable to proletarians and therefore revolution should be
abandoned for the benefit of evolution. (35) Taking over the proletarian
critique against social democracy, a critique that opposes the revolutionary
struggle against capital and the state to the open reformism of social
democracy, centrism seems to carry out its action under the banner of the
struggle against capital and the state, but it objects to the appeal for
the constitution of a party outside and against social democracy: a party
opposed to elections, to parliamentarianism, to trade unionism, to frontism…
and that leads the social war to its ultimate consequences. In this sense,
even though it takes over some central aspects of the proletarian critique,
as it doesn’t take its critiques to the point of their ultimate consequences
and as it doesn’t oppose social democracy with all its strength, centrism
is in fact a full part of it and constitutes indeed the last rampart of
capital.
<p>By its nature, centrism oscillates between the revolutionary flags that
it waves and a policy preventing the rupture with the historic social democracy,
hence the fact that many consider it as suspended between classes. But
in reality, this fluctuating policy, led in the name of the proletariat,
is not and cannot be suspended above the void. It puts a brake on the constitution
of the proletariat as a force and fulfils an objectively counter-revolutionary
function, forming in fact an extreme faction of social democracy.
<p>Many groups and organisations present in the circus against the summits
convey a set of ideologies that hinder the necessary proletarian rupture,
and this, in spite of the fact that these groups and organisations profess
the struggle against capital and the state. It is precisely these centrist
barriers that we want to denounce.
<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">Anti-capitalism? Against the state?</font></u></h2>
Facing the proletarian rage against summits and anti-summits, facing the
ridiculous and timid character of <i>Attac</i> and other social democrat
structures –which are in every respect accomplices of the other factions-
thousands of proletarians opposed the fundamentals of our class’ critique
against these bourgeois critiques. Dozens of groups coming from the five
continents, hundreds of leaflets, thrown stones, Molotov cocktails, pamphlets
and articles denounce social democrats’ critique towards the International
Monetary Fund and the World Bank, and put forward the struggle against
capital and the state. But merely declaring to be against capital is not
enough to fight against capitalism, claiming to be an anarchist or a communist
is not enough to fight against the state. When we approach the very heart
of the content of this critique, we note several confusions concerning
the meaning and the ideologisation of an amount of pseudo ruptures, which
in fact constitute a centrist position preventing the real proletarian
rupture and its insurrectionalist practice.
<p>There is so an “anti-capitalist” fashion. A lot of groups and organisations
claim to be “anti-capitalists”. Nevertheless, in their practice, we very
often notice that they confine themselves to the denunciation of multinational
companies, monopolies, financial capital, “imperialism” (36), certain countries
as well as the International Monetary Fund and the similar institutions,
which comes in fact to support in a thinly veiled way the social democrat
ideology of capitalism humanisation This kind of “anti-capitalism” is nothing
new; it is an old social democrat story. Already in Marx’ time, these kind
of anti-capitalist, socialist ideologies were in fashion, and he denounced
them as bourgeois and petty bourgeois socialism. Thereafter, social democracy
has theorised that “capitalism is henceforth monopolistic and imperialistic”
(37), then justifying opportunism and reformism, and contributing to imperialistic
war in the name of a more democratic capitalism.
<p>Nowadays, bourgeois anti-capitalists who invariably defend a bourgeois
state against another are a common thing. Moreover, entire fractions of
the international bourgeoisie, that have always, in the name of socialism,
supported the capitalistic and imperialistic policy of the Russian block
(and sometimes belonged to it), now attempt to recycle themselves. Let
us only mention the many leftist sectors that spoke about anti-capitalism
in order to better defend a faction against another in the imperialistic
confrontation, as at the time of the Gulf War where, in their opposition
to “the Yankees”, these leftists didn’t support the proletariat but rather
the Baath party, the republican guard and Saddam Hussein.
<p>For us, it is indispensable to denounce these positions, and that’s
what a leaflet signed “some libertarians” does, distributed in Canada in
April 2001:
<p>“<i>But more insidious because closer to us, marching in our footsteps,
is this new extreme tendency of respectable citizenism: of course, we’re
talking about this movement self-proclaimed ‘anti-capitalist’, ‘anti-authoritarian’,
‘self-managementist’, and so on. Under the new anti-capitalism lays capital!!!</i>
<p><i>To this radical wing skilled in anti-capitalist rhetoric that deftly
handles declarations of principles, we’d be tempted to reply: ‘keep talking,
baby!’ In fact, they have a grudge against financial capital and corporations;
this is the old anti-imperialism that reappears through the back door.
Childish socialism of yesterday turned into a commendable anti-capitalism
paired with a requirement for total democracy. All the capitalistic separations
are magnified into real identities that should be safeguarded and promoted
(sex, age, race, nationality, social or economic roles, minerals, plants
and cosmos, the list is endless…). This turbulent wing discreetly recovers
the business of their more respectable elders, but in front of the media
gallery they accuse them of treason. Besides, it mostly acts as a shock
troop for parties and trade unions, which in turn use them as scarecrows.</i>”
<p>The critique of the currently trendy affinitarian ideology, made by
our “libertarian” comrades, appears to be especially relevant. Instead
of pushing the proletariat towards unification on the basis of the homogeneity
of interests, perspectives and social project, this affinitarian ideology
strengthens all the divisions and separations of capital by magnifying
them into real identities to be protected: culture, sex, race, age, region,
and even sometimes beliefs, sects, opinions, religions… Fashionable music
could be a criteria of affinity, but regrouping upon this single basis
can only separate proletarians and sort them into categories developed
by bourgeois society whereas what we need is to shatter all these little
“boxes” and to develop an homogeneous force against capital. (38)
<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">Contradictory expressions of the proletarian
rupture</font></u></h2>
But this typical bourgeois and leftist “anti-capitalism” still coexists
(although we battle against this coexistence) with a deep critique of social
democracy that somehow expresses the difficult rising proletariat’s rupture
against social democracy at international level. This rupture is of course
jammed, curbed by this leftist ideology of social democracy that is also
undergoing a full recycling process (like garbage) and is painting itself
with “anti-capitalism” and “anti-statism” colours.
<p>In some cases proletarian ruptures are clear and demarcating; in some
others we can still find the whole leftist ideology of the 60’s and 70’s,
that drags along Marxism-Leninism as well as Trotskyism, Castrism, Guevarism,
bourgeois anti-imperialism, and reconciliation of this whole cocktail under
the libertarian banner, always in fashion.
<p>To express this contradiction we chose the example of the <i>Young anti-capitalists’
Manifesto against the World Social Forum</i> (see the frame).

<h4>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">YOUNG ANTI-CAPITALISTS’ MANIFESTO AGAINST
THE WORLD SOCIAL FORUM</font></h4>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>From Seattle to Washington,
London, Minau, Melbourne, Seoul, Prague, and Nice, tens of thousands of
young anti-capitalists have repeatedly denounced, through direct action,
the large monopoles and international organisms such as the IMF, the World
Bank and the European Union. These institutions are responsible for the
exploitation of millions of workers, for the destruction of the environment,
and for the submission of millions of people to the worst conditions of
poverty. The denunciation of these young anti-capitalists is unambiguous
when they shout in the streets around the world: “Capitalism kills, let
us kill capitalism” and “Down with the IMF”.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Now, here in Porto Alegre,
in the World Social Forum, the NGO’s, the trade unionist bureaucracies
and the headship of the institutionalised parties alter the content of
the young anti-capitalists’ struggle and substitute it with the reactionary
policy of “humanization of capital”. To humanize capital with the French
ministers who persecute immigrants and take part in the government, which,
with the NATO, bombed Yugoslavia, assassinating thousands of people and
repressing the anti-capitalists in Nice; to humanize capitalism with bankers
and multinational corporations, to humanize capitalism side by side with
the governments which, like the PT [Brazilian Workers’ Party of Lula],
keep on paying the debt, repress the teachers’ strike in Rio Grande do
Sul and the occupation of a federal public domain in Porto Alegre by the
MST (Movement of the Landless), repress ambulant merchants and the homeless
during the urban occupations in Porto Alegre, and continue to give money
to multinational corporations.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Truly, the star [reference
to the star symbol of the PT] guiding this prefecture and government, so-called
popular and democratic in view of the 2002 elections, has decided to act
as an experimental base for a new form of capitalism management based on
a social democracy (39) allowing bourgeois exploitation and pleasing the
middle-class with illusions of democracy, such as the Participative Budget
which circumvents social protests by co-opting the popular movements. And
to complete the picture, there are all the other “left-wing” parties, which,
even when they criticise that policy, capitulate rather than put it into
question more consistently.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>To humanize capitalism is
utopian and reactionary. This is why we, young anti-capitalists of the
Youth Camp, we stick with the anti-capitalist movement and express our
solidarity towards the young people who, in Davos, denounced the World
Economic Forum. And we say that the World Social Forum is an imposture
created by those who wish to divert the anti-capitalist class struggle
into a class collaboration policy and elections, hence maintaining the
implementation of capitalism’s misery.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>This is why we form our own
workshops centred on the creation of a anti-capitalist national network,
whose motto is “Down with the World Economic Forum, the IMF, the World
Bank and the World Trade Organisation”, to which the World Social Forum
is no alternative, “Down with the Colombia Plan”, “Long live the Palestinian
Intifada”, “No to the payment of the external debt”, “No to privatisations”.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Capitalism kills; let us
kill capitalism. It is the duty of youth and workers, faithful to the spirit
of Seattle, Nice, Prague and Davos, to prevent the anti-capitalist intervention
to be distorted and used by its own enemies. (40)</font></font></td>

This document expresses a proletarian critique of the World Social Forum
organised by social democracy in Porto Alegre, and clearly affirms that
“<i>another world is possible</i>” –main slogan of the Porto Alegre anti-summit-
“<i>only by destroying capitalism</i>”. It seems to us very important that
this decisive point also materialises into the denunciation of social democracy’s
parties and trade unions, into the denunciation of their repressive and
anti-proletarian daily social practice, especially with regards to Brazilian
social democrat parties such as the Workers’ Party of Lula, this Brazilian
Walesa. We also need to emphasize the frontal denunciation of the ideology
of capitalism humanisation, omnipresent in summits and anti-summits, as
well as the affirmation of the fact that capitalism is murder and we therefore
need to murder it.
<p>However, although it represents a contribution towards the critique
of this world (and this is why we publish it), this manifesto is confused
and denotes a lack of rupture concerning some aspects, probably because
it is a production of several groups with different political programs.
With the following examples, we shall try to affirm the critique made by
the proletariat and further the deepening of the rupture with social democracy
and its centrist expressions. We will try to send these critiques to the
different groups that signed the manifesto.
<ul>
<li>
The manifesto does not refer to proletariat against capitalism but to “young
anti-capitalists” (and even to “poor people”), which is a concession to
fashionable terminology (and as for the word “people”, a concession to
popular-frontist social democracy).</li>

<li>
The manifesto puts the blame for “the exploitation of millions of workers”
on IMF, World Bank, WTO and European Union, which is a typical concession
to social democrat anti-imperialism and anti-monopolism, which ruled in
Porto Alegre WSF. These institutions are not “responsible” for exploitation,
as social democracy tries to make us believe; it’s capitalism itself, every
(big-, medium- or small-sized) capitalistic enterprise, the bourgeois of
every (big-, medium- or small-sized) country that holds the responsibility.
(41)</li>

<li>
The manifesto says “<i>Long live the Palestinian Intifada</i>” and not
the struggle of the proletariat in Palestine against capital and the state.
It’s as if there were not, in Palestine, the same class contradictions
that exist everywhere else; which is problematic if you refer to the previous
point. In Palestine this watchword is not a class watchword; even worse,
it is the watchword of the PLO bourgeoisie and the Arabian national states,
like Libya. In Brazil, and elsewhere in the world, and for the same reasons,
this watchword cannot be a proletarian one either. On the contrary, it
is in favour of the bourgeoisie, of its imperialistic allies, and even
of the police that tortures in that region and also supports the “Palestinian
Intifada”.</li>

<li>
The manifesto contains some typical slogans from the struggles between
bourgeois factions such as: “<i>No to the payment of external debt</i>”,
and that are no more than a matter of negotiation between factions of international
capital. Indeed, the non-payment the debt would not alter in any way the
level of exploitation and would therefore not improve in the slightest,
the fate of the proletariat. Only the national bourgeoisie would benefit
from it. Once again, it is the governments (left- as well as right-wing
ones) that assert that our misery is caused by the debts of “our state”
and “our bourgeoisie”; they are the ones, which try to convince us that
the debt is not a bourgeois’ debt but the debt “of the people of such or
such country”. Another example: “<i>No to privatisations</i>”. As if the
fact that capital changes hands could increase or decrease the misery of
our class! It is social democracy that has always said that the nationalisation
of capital improves the situation of the working class! As if in the countries
where capital is juridically more state-controlled there was less misery,
as Leninist, Trotskyite and Stalinist factions of social democracy allege.</li>
</ul>
It is clear that the issues we have criticised above have a common denominator:
the fact that the revolutionary critique of capital remains impregnated
with an “anti-imperialistic”, third-worldist critique, that is to say,
a bourgeois critique. Indeed and in spite of a pseudo radicalisation, these
are the claims of social democracy:
<ul>
<li>
Social democracy refers to “the people”; the manifesto refers to “the poor
people”;</li>

<li>
Social democracy focuses the responsibility on free trade and the policies
of the IMF and the World Bank; the manifesto affirms that capitalism is
murder but considers these institutions responsible for exploitation;</li>

<li>
Social democracy always supported national liberation and therefore imperialistic
wars as well; the manifesto supports the “Palestinian Intifada” and not
the proletariat fighting against capitalism in Palestine (against the state
of Israel, against the PLO’s one, against capital and against the state,
basically);</li>

<li>
Social democracy –like the right wing- always presented the bourgeois’
debt as a national problem in order to rouse solidarity from the proletarians
with the bourgeois of every country; the manifesto considers the question
of the debt as everybody’s problem and not exclusively the bourgeois’ problem.
The manifesto demands the “<i>Non-payment of the debt</i>”, which only
leads to the mobilisation of the proletariat for the support of some national
and international factions that will benefit from the debt cancellation,
whereas our class has nothing to gain in this matter;</li>

<li>
Finally, the manifesto opposes privatisations to nationalisations and defends
the latter. It therefore supports the capitalistic state as owner against
private capital. This is the classic position of social democracy (dear
to Marxists-Leninists) that defends the juridical nationalisation of the
means of production. (42)</li>
</ul>
Wide sectors of social democracy have, by pure opportunism, renounced some
of these issues, like the last two for example, but this in no way confers
on them a proletarian character; defending them does not push the battle
against capital one single step further.
<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">Destruction of commodity?</font></u></h2>
It is logical that revolutionaries brandish the critique of commodity that
the proletariat has always put forward; it is logical that nowadays, the
struggles of the proletariat try, in an increasingly clearer way, to reach
their aim: the destruction of commodity society.
<p>But most of the time, this tendency is understood and has repercussions
in a completely immediatist way, and many claim to be achieving the destruction
of the world of commodity society and the empire of commodity through actions
such as those led in Seattle.
<p>In this way, the “Appeal of a Black Block at the Summit of Americas
in April, 20<sup>th</sup>-22<sup>nd</sup>, 2001” said: “<i>A spectre haunts
America, it is the spectre of the anarchist rioter. His well-known black
mask, made necessary by the vertiginous rise of electronic surveillance,
is henceforth recognized as the symbol of a social terrorism, which nowadays
and more than ever appears to us as a human imperative and a moral duty.</i>
<p><i>Rioters in Seattle have, we hope, opened up the way to the destruction
of the commodity empire. By attacking the very heart of the American fortress,
that no one suspected to be so fragile, and the object of the capitalistic
modern cult, in short, by smashing shop windows that reflected our status
of loyal consumers, rioters gave to the struggle against globalisation
of the markets the only possible liberating content.</i>
<p><i>Suddenly, a struggle that seemed to be getting definitively stuck
in the precipice of servile compromise brought to us for 60 years by the
same unionist-collaborationists and the same bureaucrats of the community
under state subcontract, suddenly, this struggle became a danger… By directly
attacking the windowed goods, rioters in Seattle didn’t only satisfy their
desire to possess these too often inaccessible products that advertisement
concocts for us as the climax of happiness. They essentially attacked the
main goal the whole of the present oppressive system aims at, they attacked
the main realisation of our society: commodity.</i>”
<p>In all these actions, the proletariat expresses in an elementary way
its critique of the bourgeois society and programs that propose a more
human capitalism. And it is correct to affirm that this critique expresses
the re-emergence of the proletarian antagonism towards the world of private
property and commodity. But believing that the commodity is in such way
being destroyed or that this is the way that leads to its destruction,
is turning a blind eye to all revolutionary perspectives, it means confusing
a quite limited action, an elementary protest, with revolution itself.
<p>Appropriation and/or destruction of any particular commodity are an
elementary act of all proletarian revolts. As an act of protest, as an
attack against private property, it was always part of the riots, but this
is not an act of destruction of “The Commodity”. Commodity cannot be destroyed
by the physical attack on the thing, it is necessary to destroy its other
pole: value. Attacking its immediacy, the object, cannot abolish the commodity.
To abolish it, it is necessary to destroy its social form: its very essence.
Between this elementary form of demonstration of hate towards capitalism
and its actual destruction, the main thing is simply missing: social revolution,
proletarian insurrection, revolutionary dictatorship of the proletariat,
despotic destruction of the market as well as the “equality, liberty, fraternity”
inherent to it, eradication of private property, democracy, law of value,
and with them, the indispensable organisation of social production according
to human needs. (43)
<p>One may say that the text expresses itself in a symbolic way, that it
is a parable, which obviously appeals for a real direction, and that’s
what is meant by destruction of commodity. (44) Nothing of the kind! Blind
optimism and immediatism are obvious and counterproductive in the following
affirmation of the text: “<i>We anarchists (nevertheless not the whole
of us are rioters!), revolted, or simply responsible citizens, we shall
leave total devastation in our wake. And when in the morning we shall sweep
out glass splinters and goods that we have converted into projectiles,
making them useful for once, what will then be swept are the ruins of oppression.</i>”
<p>However many kilograms of stones have been thrown, whatever amount of
commodities and shop windows have been destroyed… imagining that the ruins
of oppression can be swept without a social revolution, that capitalism
can be destroyed without revolution, without revolutionary dictatorship
is as utopian as to dream of a more human capitalism like “<i>Attac</i>”
and the bourgeois of the Porto Alegre forum do. It is the same kind of
stupid illusion than imagining destroying the police by merely confronting
a few dozen or hundreds of cops. Impossible! Capitalism under its normal
functioning mode has and will always destroy commodity (usually in order
to prevent the devalorisation of such kind of commodity in particular):
liquidation and arson of stocks, destruction during wars… and this doesn’t
undermine commodity in the slightest. On the contrary, the particular destruction
of commodities always reinforces the world of commodity and valorisation.
<p>Finally, alleging that during these summits and anti-summits, on basis
of the so-called “direct action”, the proletariat might have at last discovered
the way of proletarian internationalism or, as some groups already assert,
that through these actions we might have entered a phase of direct confrontation
between the capitalist International and the revolutionary International,
is clearly a failure to understand the functioning of capitalism and the
revolution program, the revolutionary strategy. This inevitably leads to
stirring up confusion, by playing a centrist role in the proletarian movement
(by preventing the necessary rupture).
<p>In order to show how this kind of activist ideology leads to “forgetting”
the fundamental aspects of the revolutionary program, we shall once more
quote the above-mentioned appeal, which claims to fight against capital,
the state and patriarchy, but, however, in a text headed “<i>Down with
reformists</i>”, claims: “<i>Social order should be achieved through solidarity
of interests and free association, and not through oppression of ideas
and people. The State, even though it’s composed with ‘elected’ people,
is also formed with civil servants. We need to understand that these civil
servants don’t exist because of necessity, but rather as a result of the
lack of democracy in our system</i>.”
<p>The text doesn’t criticise democracy; it imputes the state’s harm to
the lack of democracy, as any reformist does. One may respond that many
militants organised within the <i>Black Block</i> scene do not share this
social democrat position, and we’re sure this is true. However, the sad
thing is that concerning such important and central issues of the social
democrat program, such as this fishy denunciation of the lack of democracy,
such antagonistic positions can coexist. This is one of the unavoidable
consequences of libertarian ideology and freethinking. For us on the contrary
the critique of democracy is the key of the critique of the bourgeois state.
It is not by asking for more democracy that we shall destroy the state,
it is by abolishing practically and authoritatively this famous democracy,
as pure as it may be. (45)
<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">Communisation?</font></u></h2>
Another so-called “new” centrist ideology is the one called nowadays “communisation”.
For example, the leaflet signed “some libertarians”, quoted above for its
interesting critique of pseudo-anti-capitalism, affirms: “<i>In order to
lead to the production of new social relations, the attacks against capitalism
must already contain a communisation of the struggle and the relations
which emerge from it. There is no positive project anymore, no possible
proletarian affirmation within capital.</i>”
<p>Of course, we agree with the fact that in the struggle against capital
we must produce new relations and that there is not any possible proletarian
affirmation within capital. The problem is this “little word”, very trendy
nowadays in some pseudo-revolutionary circles: “communisation”. As if communism
could develop little by little without before destroying capitalism, as
if it could emerge without first completely wiping out capitalism, as if
the capitalistic market could disappear without a human despotism exerted
against it. In fact this theory is not new either. Since the early 20<sup>th</sup>
century some sectors of social democracy developed what they then designated
as “socialisation”: society had to “socialise” itself little by little.
<p>It is clear that the advocates of the theory of “communisation” will
consider this parallel like as an offence and will protest by saying that
we’re dealing with a totally different matter. In practice however, in
both cases a gradualist conception is introduced, and the qualitative leap
that insurrection, the dictatorship against the rate of profit and value
constitute, is overtly denied; without this leap talking about communisation
or socialisation can only confuse and serve the Reaction.
<p>On the other hand, the present ideology of “communisation” emerges from
a group, which never split from social democracy, from Leninism and euro-centrism.
“<i>Th&eacute;orie Communiste</i>” is a typically euro-centrist group according
to which all what happens in Europe is the feat of the proletariat, and
all what that happens far from Europe is the feat of the popular masses
(they went as far as describing the proletarian revolt in Iraq in 1991
as a “popular uprising”!). In the same way, “<i>Th&eacute;orie Communiste</i>”
overtly defends that in Russia, at the time of Lenin, the dictatorship
of the proletariat ruled! For internationalist revolutionaries, it is clear
that this dictatorship was exerted <i>against</i> the proletariat and that
it was no more than the same old capitalistic dictatorship, as we have
demonstrated in several analyses. (46) On these bases (that assimilate
the program of the proletariat with the development of capitalism, as defended
by Lenin) and on the basis of the theorisation according to which the question
of the revolutionary transition would be historically out of date because
the program of the proletariat has been achieved by capital (47), it is
considered that the proletariat could negate itself and achieve communism
without reinforcing as a class and imposing its dictatorship (which is
overtly revisionist).
<p>This theory could seem modern and attractive, but it is absolutely unclear
on the essential issue of the revolution, the insurrection and the revolutionary
and dictatorial action of destruction of the bourgeois society. How would
the proletariat be able to negate itself without constituting itself as
a force? Certainly not within capitalism, as claimed by social democracy.
By getting organised outside and against capitalism. By getting organised
outside of its parliamentary and trade unionist structures and against
its processions and its sheep demonstrations, by constituting itself as
an antagonistic force against all this circus. Only by constituting itself
as an international force, as a revolutionary party aimed at destroying
the bourgeois world can the proletariat, in the same process, negate itself
and destroy capital and the state. To try and make us believe that the
world could be “communised” without the organised power of the proletariat
as a party, means collaborating with all the bourgeois leftist political
spectrum that strives to deny precisely the most important aspect: the
violent and total shattering of the capitalistic order by the revolution;
the quality leap, the revolutionary conspiracy and the insurrection, the
international organisation of the proletariat as communist party, its destructive
action of the whole bourgeois society. Talking about communism without
referring to all this is utopian and reactionary.
<p>If the classic terminology of the revolutionaries struggling for the
revolutionary party, for the revolutionary dictatorship of the proletariat
or for a proletarian semi-state… bothers the “libertarian” comrades who
wrote this leaflet, let them choose another one, provided they don’t give
up the main thing: the insurrectionary struggle, the destruction of capitalism
through violence. Many revolutionaries, from Bakunin to Flores Magon used
words like dictatorship of the international brothers, dictatorship of
anarchy, dictatorship of workers’ councils and even “liberal party”, without
however (and that’s why they were revolutionaries) giving up the essential:
the necessity of the concentration of the revolutionary violence, of the
revolutionary armed struggle, the necessity to get rid of capitalism through
class violence.
<p>In the environment where our “libertarian” comrades operate, it is not
a matter of words. When they consider communisation without revolutionary
dictatorship of the proletariat, these comrades are actually giving up
social revolution. (48)
<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">Direct action?</font></u></h2>
Historically, the proletariat always opposed direct action against social
democracy, this fundamental force of containment and channelling of the
proletarian struggle whose strategy relies on the representation and the
mediation in trade unions, parliaments, elections and support to delegates
and political leaders… Direct action means an action without mediator nor
delegate, assumed by all, strike and demonstration, occupation of the street,
revolutionary violence, insurrection, revolutionary dictatorship, action
that does not require mediation nor delegation and, in this way, historically
constitutes the contrary of democratic action, of citizen life.
<p>Nowadays, in Davos, Seattle, Prague, Gothenburg, Naples, and Genoa…
some militant groups revel in words like direct action they merely assimilate
with violent action in the street. However, if violence is indeed one component
of direct action, it is not enough to define it.
<p>Direct action of the proletariat against the parliamentarianism, trade
unionism, electoralism… of social democracy does need neither mediation,
nor delegation, nor representative elections, which can be applied generally
and reproducible everywhere and by all.
<p>It means that to be <i>direct</i>, in the historic meaning of the word,
violent action cannot rest on delegations and must be executable by proletarians
wherever they may be. The key of direct action, which we oppose to social
democracy, lies precisely in the fact that any proletarian group can assume
it where it is, and, through this practice, oppose delegation, and mediation
which are determining elements of democracy and therefore of any bourgeois
political domination.
<p>Direct action claimed in Seattle, Prague, Davos, Gothenburg, Naples,
and Genoa… is not of this kind. Indeed, violence is mystified there because
it is used as a synonym for direct action, whereas in practice, action
is undertaken by sending delegates to a place defined as the centre where
direct action par excellence is supposed to be developed.
<p>This doesn’t mean that action led against the circus of summits and
anti-summits is not a part of the proletariat’s direct action. What we
criticise is that the present organisations don’t urge the militants to
struggle on a daily basis, where they live (capital is everywhere), but
magnify their own activism and present their “direct action” as the most
valid.
<p>The mystification that consists in considering Davos, Seattle, Prague,
Gothenburg, Naples, and Genoa… as decisional centres of capital, and the
fact that these confrontations are given a semi-insurrectional status they
don’t actually deserve, makes those groups consider that “direct action”
consists, par excellence, in battling against capitalism according to the
timetable of bourgeois congresses, as if any other struggle had only a
local significance and was therefore of lesser importance. They forget
that apart from proletarians who actually live in the cities where summits
and anti-summits are held and take to the streets, only a handful of militants,
of delegates of the proletariat of different countries can go to these
conferences in order to perform “direct action”, and therefore the principle
of delegation is maintained. That these delegates throw more stones and
Molotov cocktails changes nothing to the fact that it is still a mediation
through which the majority of the proletariat should feel represented.
As the previously quoted trade unionist said: “<i>so that the poor of the
world can see…</i>” that in Europe there are trade unionists… who represent
them!
<p>It is obviously encouraging to see that in any country where summits
are held, the proletariat aggressively denounces these capitalistic celebrations
and takes to the street, it is stimulating to see that groups of proletarians
coming from other countries collaborate on the organisation of these actions,
and moreover, that they also organise them (and/or coordinate and centralise
the organisation) in other countries. This is not what we criticise; the
coordination and the organisation beyond borders are fundamental for the
affirmation and the strengthening of the community of struggle that will
destroy capital.
<p>What we affirm is that the majority of proletarians from other countries
are not able to go where these events take place, and besides that have
no interest in doing so. Contrary to what centrists of all kinds publish,
whose appraisal of the next “triumph” is based on the thousands of activists
or hundreds of busses that will go to the next summit, this cannot be our
perspective.
<p>All the more so since those who can attend such events are only a minority
under very particular conditions, notably exceptional work conditions with
regards to free time and remuneration, which enable them to afford the
trip. In some cases, hundreds of proletarians and revolutionary militants
make a huge effort to send some dozens of militants to these capitalistic
jamborees, but it is obvious that in general only trade-union apparatuses
and political parties, conceived for functioning through delegation, can
afford this type of trip on regular basis. No wonder then if, in addition
to the cops and the secret service agents of several countries, political
and trade union delegates swarm in the streets of the cities that shelter
the summits and anti-summits.
<p>From the point of view of the proletariat the real direct action is
first and foremost the action led every day against the boss, against the
bourgeoisie facing us, against parties and trade unions that want to contain
us. We need to generalise it, to make it worldwide; we need to coordinate
it, to encourage the militant exchanges between countries; we need to fight
together everywhere against world capital, but it is absurd to imagine
that the more militants we gather in one single spot the better it will
be. At the time of the insurrection, the world proletariat won’t be concentrated
in one place, because it won’t be a matter of destroying commodity in any
particular city or any particular country, but on the whole planet and
we won’t achieve this by confronting either a local police force or a national
one, but by destroying the bourgeois power as a whole and all over the
world.
<p>To believe that proletarians will gather and express themselves more
and more massively against conferences until capitalism ends up blowing
up is not only harmful and counterproductive for the movement, but it originates
in stupid illusions and distorts the very concept of direct action. Even
if it is invited to do so, the combative proletariat won’t take part in
these bourgeois demonstrations. At the very most, some groups that represent
it, as well as trade-union delegates who would like to speak in their name.
Anyway, the interest of the revolutionary groups which would decide to
go there wouldn’t be to make the apology of “direct action” these representatives
promote, but rather to centralise the direct action of the proletariat
that we have to urge everywhere.
<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">Proletarian interest and centrist ideology</font></u></h2>
Let us summarize some aspects of the contradiction between proletarian
interest and centrist ideology.
<p>The proletariat’s interest lies in programmatic unification and operational
decentralization, unity in leadership and revolutionary perspective and,
contradictorily, scattering and dispersion of action, while targeting the
same enemy.
<p>But the dominant ideology, even among groups that have split with social
democracy, seems to impulse the opposite: let’s concentrate all our forces
in one particular spot of the planet, at this day and hour (in line with
the summits and anti-summits’ dictates!), but, politically, let everyone
do whatever he wants, let groups constitute according to their affinities,
rally around their own ideas (and this, of course, without any kind of
centralization whatsoever).
<p>The proletariat’s interest is unique and worldwide, and can only be
imposed through unification against all the divisions resulting from capital’s
society, whose credo, whose rule, is the struggle of all against all. Women,
elderly, children, unemployed, Arabs, coloured people, miners, farmers,
students, Asians, Latino-Americans, Europeans, Africans, landless peasants,
shanty-town dwellers… all have, independently from what they think or believe,
or have been persuaded to think or believe, the same interest in abolishing
the bourgeois society.
<p>But the dominant ideology uses any pretext to impose its divisions,
based on race, sex, culture, ethnic group… and even among breakaway groups,
the freedom and affinity ideology continues to prevail. Instead of building
up proletarian unity, the bourgeois society’s partitions are reproduced,
in name of local specificity and the freedom of all. It is advocated to
constitute several regroupings around the divisions enforced by capital,
founded on culture, race, religion, tastes and habits, like these groups
that bring together the aficionados of a certain type of music, homosexuals,
animal protectors, Coca-cola cans collectors, etc.
<p>The communist revolution’s interest is to restore the criticism of capitalism
up to its very foundations, the destruction of wage labour, commodity,
state… and therefore focus on the question of power, the necessity of the
proletarian insurrection and destruction of the state.
<p>But the predominant ideology in this milieu encourages everyone to criticize
capitalism and imagine changes in their own way, and to elaborate plans
and gather around affinities. As if the destruction of capitalism were
dissociable from the destruction of the bourgeoisie’s armed power, as if
there were plenty of different ways to achieve destruction of the bourgeois
society, as if centuries of class struggle hadn’t established by now what
is revolutionary and what isn’t…
<p>The interest of the communist revolution is, wherever it occurs, proletarian
action against worldwide capital, direct action against the bourgeoisie
and the state that stand against us (49), and the generalisation of theses
confrontations.
<p>Another predominant ideology in several proletarian groups that have
broken away with social democracy consists in aiming at sending activists
to support demonstrations.
<p>The interest of the proletariat lies in a total and irreversible rupture
with social democracy and its whole program, therefore implying a rupture
with democracy, anti-imperialism and third-worldism.
<p>The dominant ideology, in the name of freedom, exhorts proletarians
into a unity without principles, without program, without clear rupture,
and often they fall for the social democrat lure of critical support to
democracy. The interest of the proletariat is to get organized as a force,
as an international power coordinating and programmatically centralizing
actions that arise everywhere around the globe.
<p>The more decentralized the action and more centralized the leadership,
the fiercer the proletarian struggle. (50)
<p>Activist ideology impulses on the contrary a political decentralization
and an operational centralization, that is to say an absence of unity in
leadership and the concentration of all militants on the same spot.
<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">The proletarian movement is one</font></u></h2>
However, the movement of the worldwide proletariat, our movement, is one,
and is so whether its protagonists are aware of it or not: those who battled
to enter Quito, fought the same war, whether they realized it or not, than
those who broke shop windows in Seattle and those who, at this very moment,
confronted the bourgeois state in Algeria. We could add to the list the
landless peasants in Brazil, the deserters and revolutionary defeatists
of the whole world, as well as the “anti-capitalists” or “anti-statists”
who form small groups to challenge capitalism on the barricades.
<p>And yet, none of these movements perceives to which extent they all
actually all belong to one and only movement aiming at abolishing the present
conditions. The proletariat as a class hasn’t re-appropriated its experience,
or its strength, yet. In other articles we explain the reasons of this
generalized class unawareness and we provide its historic reasons, that
sum up to the triumph of the counter-revolution in the 20<sup>th</sup>
century and the concealment of the revolutionary struggle’s whole history.
<p>Here, we have decided to focus on the obstacles that today prevent the
proletariat, in its different international expressions, from perceiving
it belongs to one and the same revolutionary class. We shall not further
develop the “what is to be done” and “here and now” topics. We can return
to our examples of Seattle and Ecuador, to illustrate the separation between
two movements in appearance so different.
<p>Despite the actual separation and the unawareness that it is one and
the same movement, in both cases the proletariat confronts the same enemy
and faces, to a certain extent, the same ideological limitations. In both
cases, the confrontation against capitalism, the rupture achieved in the
field, the attempt to get organized outside and against the local social-democrat
fraction, is neither theorized nor practically assumed on a permanent basis.
This is why, when the movement leaves the streets, social democracy always
manages, although by different ways, to catch it back and re-introduce
all separations in it.
<p>Yet, the question of the rupture with social democracy and assuming
the worldwide proletariat’s movement as a unique movement is one and the
same problem. Only a permanent and organized rupture, leading to its ultimate
consequences the criticism we develop here, will allow the worldwide proletariat
to acknowledge itself as such. And in a reciprocal way, only the acknowledgment
of constituting one and the same movement, through a correspondent organization
at international level, will lead the proletariat to assume once and for
all its rupture with social democracy. There is no other way so that every
direct proletarian action in one place is understood everywhere else as
the affirmation of the same organic being, capable of constituting a real
international
leadership. To speak of historic confrontation between the international
of capital and the revolutionary international will then take its full
meaning.
<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">What’s to be done?</font></u></h2>
The analysis of the objective balance of forces is not aimed at contemplating
the world “as it is”. For the revolutionaries, it constitutes, on the contrary,
the basis for subjective action. It is not a matter of portraying the world;
the point is to transform it.
<p>From Ecuador to Seattle, we are all on same boat, all in this same capitalist
society which we fight as we can. It is a struggle community that affirms
itself and stands out.
<p>We are deeply implicated in both types of movement around the world;
we fight so that every expression of the proletariat assumes this opposition
to the whole of capital and therefore becomes aware that it is part of
one and the same worldwide movement, aiming to abolish capital and the
state. When we say “we”, we refer not only to our small formal group, butalso
to the organized revolutionary minorities that struggle, against the current,
for the constitution of the proletariat as a class, and thus as a party
at world level, and are not afraid to claim it, against the trends of opinion
and eternal inventors of “neo” who pretend it is “has been”.
<p>What is developed here is at the same time a centralization of the debate
growing among these revolutionary minorities, which, through their action,
and whether poorly or well coordinated, from Albania to Bolivia, from Russia
to Iran, fight to affirm the unique strength of the worldwide proletariat.
To denounce social democracy, as we do in this text, in any assembly or
on the barricades, belongs to this same struggle community. So does the
criticism without concessions of activism and centrism provided by our
comrades all over the world.
<p>This doesn’t prevent us to put forward positive watchwords to participate
in the gestation process of the leadership the proletariat needs. What
is to be done, then, to impulse the reunification of the proletariat and
its rupture with social democracy? Where will the qualitative leap forward
come from?
<p>In principle, it can appear anywhere. The geographic generalization
of a movement, as it happened in Iraq some years ago, or more recently
in Albania or Ecuador, can be decisive. If those movements didn’t spread
out more, it is because of the incapacity of the proletariat in other parts
of the world to identify to them and going the same way. Yet, in times
characterized by the non-existence of permanent proletarian associations
at a world level, only centralization and coordination between the communist
minorities in the insurgent regions and the ones from other parts of the
world can provide a continuity to the movement and tend to unify its leadership.
<p>This means that, even in the present situation, the conscious and voluntary
action of the revolutionary minorities will be decisive. Let’s focus on
what they have to do.
<p>In concrete terms, do we have to impulse these massive displacements
to the summits and counter-summits in order to “confront capital and the
state” or, on the contrary do we have to get organized in some other way
and impulse another perspective?
<p>We recognize our own movement in this movement of rupture against the
summits and counter-summits, but within it, and considering all that has
been previously said, we defend the necessity to organize
<i>outside and
against</i> them, and to build our strength in another way, on some other
dates, with a total organizational and political autonomy with regards
to the left-wing and the right-wing of the system. But, one would ask,
how to internationalise the movement, then? How to unify the struggle if
it isn’t by concentrating all our forces in one determined spot and time?
<p>Despite the criticism expressed up to here, we consider these attempts
to organize the minorities for direct action as fundamental, even if they
are now only associated to the summits and counter-summits. In this movement,
we defend perspectives of a much stronger demarcation in regards to the
program and the action. We defend the perspective of deciding the time
and place of the proletarian confrontation against capital, affirming that
we belong to one and the same class with the same enemy wherever we stand,
as originally on the occasion of the 1<sup>st</sup> of May! And we shall
battle until we achieve that again! By the way, we note that several groups
and organizations in rupture against the sterile and counter-productive
activism already object to “<i>all going to such and such city, on such
and such day</i>” and propose a different pattern of organization, without
depending on the summits schedule.
<p>The thing is, all this needs to be associated with a total rupture against
the activist show staged during the summits and counter-summits. We have
to refuse to “<i>show to the poor and moribund proletarians</i>”, via television,
that “<i>here in Europe, there are courageous people</i>”, as the trade
unionists claim. We cannot endorse this separation, with “<i>the moribund</i>”
on one side and “<i>those who know</i>” on the other. We cannot endorse
this dualism between “<i>those who are helpless</i>” and “<i>the activists</i>”
who stage a fight on the occasion of some spectacular gathering.
<p>On the contrary, in every action, we defend the necessity to organize
everywhere in the world, we assert that action can take place, and develop,
in places where no summit will ever be held, and no counter-summit summoned
by social democracy. Direct action is in total opposition with the show
logic. The show features actors and paralyses spectators, who mostly applaud.
It stages a spectacular confrontation between repression specialists and
social change specialists. As for the direct action of the proletarian
vanguard, it aims being replicated everywhere.
<p>In this sense, the qualitative leap forward resides mainly in the rupture
with the solidarity concept, which in reality and fundamentally, expresses
charity and originates in the Judaeo-Christian ideology: we act in favour
of the poor and moribund who live on the other side of the planet. Facing
that, we have to claim clearly, that what we do is not aimed at the “poor
people of the world”; we do it because we are all and everywhere exploited
and oppressed by the same social system, because we have all and everywhere
the same interests and the same enemy, because we are all the same flesh,
the same historic struggle of the exploited against all systems of exploitation
and oppression. The social revolution is a necessity of the world proletariat
and not of such and such activist group.
<p>We have nothing to show off, certainly not on TV or on Internet (even
if we use both as communication means). On the contrary, we must act in
a way that can be perfectly reproduced by the proletariat wherever it stands.
<p>If we, together with the militants and revolutionaries who today define
themselves through their struggle against capital and are aware of the
historic importance of the rupture with social democracy, if we concentrate
our forces in time and not in space, rather than cramming into the summit
and counter-summit circus, it could constitute a decisive advance for the
movement. Because, indeed, we consider it more relevant, stronger and more
effective than sending “everybody” in such or such city.
<p>Because it is coherent with direct action and impulses its development
everywhere, we put forward the need to coordinate the times of actions
in all countries, against the same objectives. In several places, there
is already an embryonic revolutionary tendency to do so. In Spain, for
instance, in the so-called “days of social struggle” or “anti-capitalist
days”, a minority tendency finds an expression, that seeks to define other
objectives, establish a different schedule, and develop other forms of
struggle beyond the opposition to the summits or the activist show.
<p>But the necessary qualitative leap forward will be done when the intensity
of the struggle that nowadays occurs exclusively on the occasion of the
summits and counter-summits demonstrations, will assume itself as part
of one and the same movement, wherever it rises, Ecuador, Albania, Indonesia
or anywhere else. This qualitative leap forward will consist in being able,
when in the future other expressions of this movement break out, to concentrate
our forces to affirm our solidarity. Not a fake solidarity, for the show,
not a demonstration that we here do things for the “moribund” proletarians
over there. On the contrary, by gaining strength everywhere, by generalizing
the proletarian movement that unfolds in one country, by descending onto
the streets and confronting the bourgeoisie and the state that stands against
us. Through that, we shall state in practice that we are one and the same
movement of abolition of the bourgeois society, that we have the same objectives
as those for which the proletarians are currently fighting against the
bourgeois social system in such or such country.
<p>Indeed, as we often repeated, the dramatic aspect of the proletarian
explosions that occur in different parts of the world, in different countries
and different languages, is precisely their isolation. This isolation allows
the worldwide bourgeoisie to continue to attack the proletariat bit-by-bit,
country-by-country. When proletarian responses strike violently, this isolation
prevents proletarians from other countries to be aware of the struggle
of their class brothers. We insist on the fact that it is the worldwide
bourgeoisie, which attacks the proletariat in every country. It is the
weakness of the proletarian action in, for instance, the European countries
and the USA that allowed the NATO to intervene unhindered, without triggering
any consistent revolutionary defeatism, to disarm and repress the insurgent
proletariat in Albania. The worst thing is that, because of the dominant
ideology, all this proletarian force that finds an expression during the
summits and counter-summits, is unaware that our strength is also there,
in things like what happened in Albania, and that, here and now, it could
be possible to prevent the isolation of the proletariat while under the
assault of all the combined forces of the bourgeoisie.
<p>The fundamental aspect of the struggle against the summits and counter-summits’
circus, is that numerous proletarians get organized to confront worldwide
capitalism, that they manage to gather their forces and strike the same
enemy at the same time. It is that there are minorities that in the name
of the revolution descend onto the streets to claim proletarian internationalism
and that again the <i>how</i> and
<i>what is to be done</i> start to be
discussed. The important, is that the central questions of the proletarian
struggle, the destruction of capitalism and the state, the revolutionary
strategy are again a matter for polemic.
<p>But we are still unable to direct this force that we managed to concentrate;
we are still unable to prevent the carrot and the stick to liquidate the
movement in such and such country, by submitting to a cruel and pathetic
isolation.
<p>Let us use this force that has the power to demonstrate, to smash, to
strike at the bourgeoisie and the state in every country, let us make it
coincide with the movements that rise in different places and therefore
prevent its isolation, let us in those battle brandish the revolutionary
banner of the unification of the struggle against capital, let us globalise
reality and the consciousness of our movement, let us develop the unique
force of the international proletariat.

<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">Notes</font></u></h3>
1. All through this article, we use the terms “summit” and “congress”,
referring to these large meetings of international capitalist organisms
that arouse proletarian hostility. And when we mention “anti-” or “counter-summits”,
we refer more precisely to the official protests of the bourgeois left
wing, of its parties and official trade unions; protests characterized
street demonstrations, parallel congress, or alternative forums or meetings.
<br>2. Cf. “General characteristics of the struggles of the present time”
in Communism n&deg;9.
<br>3. On that subject, read: “The capitalist catastrophe” in Communism
n&ordm;9.
<br>4. Cf. “General characteristics of the struggles of the present time”
in Communism n&ordm;9.
<br>5. To claim old stories as “new” is not a new phenomenon. On this matter,
the bourgeois pretension to produce ideas as it produces commodities is
present throughout the whole 20<sup>th</sup> century: cf. modern ideas,
neo-classicist economists, neo-classicism, new wave, new age, etc.
<br>6. It is hard to imagine what ideological U-turns and pirouettes these
Marxist-Leninists had to do to explain that the shift from “capitalism
to socialism” requires a violent revolution, but that the reverse is not
true!
<br>7. The “left-winger” qualification has in reality no objective basis
and is founded on pure ideology, varying according to the regions. In Latin
America or in Europe, the apology of Stalinism is still considered left-wing
politics, while in the countries from the ex-Eastern Bloc it is assimilated
to fascism and generally to the extreme right wing.
<br>8. Fundamental postulation of the world-state terrorism that will become
universal from then on.
<br>9. Which is not an easy task since, as we shall see, these attempts
of social-democrat containment are frequently outflanked by the proletariat
developing its own ruptures, cf. Seattle, Washington, Prague, Gothenburg,
Naples, Genoa…
<br>10. We don’t pretend to formulate here any critiques towards the revolutionary
comrades self-proclaimed anarchists. We have already thoroughly explained
our position on that matter, which is independent from any denomination
or ideology, and, in future publications, we shall analyse with more depth
the existing relationship between communism and anarchism. What we want
here is to stand against the dominant ideology based on the famous bourgeois
freethinking and its famous motto “I do what I want”, valid for individuals
as well as groups, and the no less famous “freedom of criticism”. This
ideology has had an enormous influence on the backstage of Davos, Porto
Alegre, etc. It is nearly always accompanied by the immediatist and activist
ideology, which, in all cases, constitutes an obstacle to the necessary
organization of the proletariat as a unified political force, capable of
endorsing a unique leadership for insurrectional preparation and action.
<br>11. The social forum of Porto Alegre, which we shall refer to later,
was elaborated on by all of these organizations, most of them international,
with the support of the Workers’ Party of Brazil, the Unique Central of
Workers and the official delegations of the “Movement of the Landless”,
also Brazilian.
<br>12. Imperialism is a much earlier phenomenon than the time social democracy
made it famous. Capitalism has always been imperialist. And the imperialist
battle between the dominant classes to get hold of the productive forces
even precedes capitalism as <strike>a</strike> production mode. If social
democracy, and Marxism-Leninism in particular (under all its forms, from
Stalinism, Trotskyism, to Maoism and Castrism, has turned imperialism into
a new phenomenon, it’s only to justify the opportunistic changes in their
policy, arguing that, precisely, things had changed. In that way, renouncement
of the anti-capitalist struggle substituting it with anti-<i>imperialist</i>
struggle (often mistaken with struggle against such and such nation) became
the
norm.
<br>13. Cf. the special issue on the social forum of Porto Alegre of the
magazine
<i>Hika, </i>entitled “Another world is possible” (P.K. 871, 48080
Bilbao, Espana or hikadon@telenis.es).
<br>14. The original version of this text has been published in our central
review in Spanish, previous to the G8 meeting and the<i> anti-summit</i>
demonstrations it generated in Genoa. This translation is, however, subsequent.
In the last issue of Communism in English, we published a comment on the
repression of those demonstrations and reproduced a leaflet from comrades
of Precari Nati.
<br>15. Further in the text, the reader will understand why we specify
“an attempt to impose its direct action” and not “assuming its direct action”.
<br>16. We have made clear that believing that the future of capital may
be decided in those kinds of meetings is no more than a myth. However,
the bourgeois do need to centralise formally in order to sign treaties,
draw perspectives and enforce more standardised economic policies, such
as those that characterise the World Bank and the IMF. Actually, the bourgeoisie
in every country makes an increasing use of the negotiations and claims
of these institutions to justify its own austerity policy. Hence this “natural”
proletarian rage against all that, and the fact that in every country,
there are confrontations against the delegations of these organisms and
the additional measures they wish to enforce.
<br>17. What is written between quotation marks is not a product of our
delirious thoughts, but of those generated by the virtual passions of the
Porto Alegre protagonists. We have quoted it textually from their press,
in particular from the issue the magazine <i>Hika </i>dedicated to the
World Social Forum, already mentioned in note 13.
<br>18. Before printing this text, some comrades have expressed their disagreement
relative to our critique of Hebe Bonafini, whom they consider as a proletarian,
struggling for many years in a particularly difficult struggle, in the
opposite direction of the democratic recuperation of a faction of the “Mothers
of the May Square”. We shall simply respond that our aim is elsewhere.
We want to denounce a counterrevolutionary show and we bitterly lament
to see someone as Hebe Bonafini play a part in it. As we mention all through
this text, our interest is to appeal to the militants not to make themselves
accomplices of social democracy and the contestation show, and to stand
outside and against it all. The presence of revolutionary militants such
as H. Bonafini is a blessing for these social-democrat pseudo-contestations;
it brings a scent of radicalism to the Forum of Porto Alegre and to the
anti-globalisation led by <i>Attac </i>and acolytes. The whole history
of popular-frontism is marked with such use of revolutionary militants:
in 1936, in Spain, the Popular Front, which later would liquidate the revolution,
affirmed itself thanks to the presence of militants such as Durrutti, who,
against the historic position of revolutionaries, called for voting in
favour of the Popular Front.
<br>19. Quotation from a leaflet signed by the Anti-capitalist Revolutionary
Movement (Ap. de correos 265, 08080 Barcelona, Spain) that clearly expresses
the real opposition between bourgeoisie and proletariat. We note, however,
that the term “proletarian youth” instead of proletariat is, according
to us, a concession to fashion. In this same document, the reading of issue
n&ordm;144, third year, of the Barcelona Counter-information Bulletin is
also recommended (http://www.sindominio.net/zitzania) “for a true information
about what happened in Nice”.
<br>20. According to an estimation published during the Washington summit,
expenses related to security amounted to 32 millions dollars. We have no
idea what is included in such sum and even less so of what it conceals,
for security reasons.
<br>21. The regime of Saddam Hussein, in Iraq, or Chavez, in Venezuela
may represent different nuances in this general policy, but it is in no
way comparable to a generalized, anchored in time phenomenon, like Stalinism
was.
<br>22. The capitalist catastrophe is going deeper. To invert the wheel
of history is a reactionary utopia. Only the destruction of capital will
open the way for humanity to build another world, which will have nothing
to do with capitalism, as we knew it a few dozens of years ago.
<br>23. We have no interest in separating these movements. What we want
is to insist on the one and only content of the proletarian movement and
on the necessity of its revolutionary centralisation. However, it is a
fact that this distinction and separation currently does exist, and that,
in both our examples, the protagonists themselves are not aware than it
is one and the same movement. This has led us to emphasize the differences,
to bring the present tendencies to their most extreme expressions (to the
point of depicting the differences as much more clearly distinct than they
are in reality), in order to analyse them. Indeed, analysing the most extreme
differences allows a development of a precise comradely criticism for everyone
of these expressions, and at the same time, puts forward that we are dealing
with one and the same movement. The following caricature allows an understanding
of our methodology: let’s consider that the movement in Ecuador originates
in economic misery, and the one in Seattle in political awareness, it appears
obviously that this distinction is a caricature, nevertheless it may help
us to clarify the actions specific to each movement, and to understand,
or better, to assume, as we state at the end of the text, that we’re dealing
with the one and the same social movement aiming at the abolition of capital.
If we were to solely insist on the fact that the struggle is part of the
same movement, and that within it everything is equal, which is ultimately
true, it would be impossible to formulate any explanation based on a comparison,
as we do here.
<br>24. Social democracy, Marxism-Leninism, anarcho-syndicalism, mention
the shift from the economic field to the political field, or the transformation
of immediate struggles into historic struggles, as if they had a different
nature. They link this change to the contribution of political awareness,
or to the political action of the party. As far as we are concerned, we
refuse this distinction (see our <i>Thesis of programmatic orientation</i>,
ICG, n&ordm;15, 31, 32 and 33); we rather refer to a generalization of
the immediate claims. The class contradictions contain in themselves their
own generalisation, which means that any struggle against the concrete
exploitation conditions, against the bourgeois austerity measures (increase
of surplus value’s rate), even if it is geographically limited, contains
in itself the struggle against this exploitation society as a whole. What
determines the shift towards generalisation is not the political action
of the vanguard elements, but, on the contrary, the development of the
proletariat’s interests that no particular struggle can bring to victory,
no particular claim can fulfil. It tends, inclusively against the intervention
of political activists, to generalise itself into a struggle against capital
and the state. Generally, as we mentioned in thesis n&ordm;15, the qualitative
leap takes shape by overriding the organizations that express partial claims
(workers organizations, classist associations, factory committees…) and
by shifting to territorial organizations in which all proletarians gather
–men and women, workers and unemployed, young and old-, such as workers’
councils, supply committees, assemblies from one or more cities…
<br>25. In the middle of the 19<sup>th</sup> century, Marx already criticised
the consideration that a movement is more global if it is more political,
hence emphasising the revolutionary political will. Marx demonstrated on
the contrary that the proletarian rebellion, even if only unfolding within
one region, contains in itself the totality. With regard to this discussion
with Ruge, read: <i>Critical notes on the article “The king of Prussia
and the social reform. By a Prussian</i>”, Karl Marx.
<br>26. Whether they are aware of it or not, proletarians who assume and
profess the minority violent action break away from democracy, even if
it is called “workers’ democracy”. They assume the fact that the revolutionary
action has nothing in common with democratic referendums and congresses.
They assume that the proletariat can only constitute itself as a force
by coordinating and centralising the different expressions that implement,
without previous consultation, the different revolutionary tasks. It’s
through this process, this affirmation of the community of struggle and
interest, that the proletariat reconstitutes itself as a class, and, consequently,
gets organised as a party opposed to all existing parties.
<br>27. There is a critique of this ideology and the form it takes today
in the text “Give up activism” published in English, in “Reflections on
June 18. Contribution on the politics behind the events that occurred in
the city of London on June 18, 1999”, Edit. Collective, October 1999. This
text gathers several interesting contributions, yet we point out two things.
First, the ideological and intellectual conception of the authors. They
do not analyse activism either as part of the social practice of the international
proletariat, of its strengths or weaknesses (and thus of the balance of
forces against capital), nor as an objective product of the movement. They
consider it as the exclusive subjective product of the “activists”. We
also point out the absence of any revolutionary counter-proposition, of
any claim of the specific revolutionary activity that since ever characterised
the most decided factions of the proletariat, that is to say the revolutionary
internationalist activity.
<br>28. One could retort that the exploited class always acts according
to the dominant class determinations, that capital is the subject of this
society and that the proletariat can only arise as a negation. It is true,
but in this precise case, it is not a matter of a spontaneous and generalised
reaction of the proletariat facing a bourgeois attack. Even if it determines
the proletariat action by its aggression, the bourgeoisie cannot predict
how it will react, neither what moment it will choose to react, nor what
kind of action it will put into practice. In the case of the summits and
anti-summits, it’s the opposite; the action of the proletariat is completely
determined and publicly known in advance.
<br>29. Quotations from pamphlets, conversations and letters from comrades.
<br>30. For the majority of these groups (in reality merely pseudo-radicals)
that use the term in an immediate and erroneous sense, “radical” means
giving a violent character to the social democrat procession, outflanking
the
<i>Attac</i> celebrations through “direct action” (see farther the
critic of the use of the term “direct action”), which in fact contradicts
the only policy the proletariat is interested in, that is to say standing
outside and against these counterrevolutionary demonstrations. For us,
toradicalise means fighting to destroy the very roots of the bourgeois
society, its foundations, its values, wage labour… all these “little programmatic
details” that are never mentioned by any of these groups.
<br>31. And this is one of the major problems of the proletariat. Social
democracy should not be criticised for its deviations, but because it is
a part of capital; its pacifism should not be denounced, but confronted
through revolutionary violence, because that pacifism is merely an ideological
element that makes it easier to inflict upon us its counterrevolutionary
violence (let us remember that social democracy always resorts to violence
against the revolution!).
<br>32. We remind that this article has been written before the G8 meeting
in Genoa. The demonstrations that occurred on that occasion provide enough
evidence of what we denounce here: one death, hundreds of wounded among
our ranks and impunity for the repressive forces.
<br>33. Through this mediation, “direct action” is also turned into a caricature!
<br>34. That is one of the great preoccupations of the bourgeoisie, particularly
the partisans of national liberation, expressed here by a French journalist:
“<i>(….) Young people in Kabylia no longer believe in anything, they only
believe in violence, they are absolutely not interested in independence,
and the independentist organisations, albeit doing their best, do not succeed
in controlling them.</i>”
<br>35. Already in his time, Bernstein wanted to get rid of the “Hegelianism”
in Marx because the question of the transformation of quantity into quality,
of the evolution of contradiction into revolution, bothered him greatly.
He intended to remove the “Blanquism” too, because he hated even more the
fact that this proletarian revolution necessarily implied revolutionary
conspiring and insurrection. Nowadays, the movement features this same
tendency to elude the rupture, the qualitative leap, the revolution, and
the insurrection.
<br>36. “Anti-imperialism” is in reality nothing but the defence of imperialist
capitalism. To be anti-imperialist without being anti-capitalist is absurd
not only because any capitalism is necessarily imperialist, because any
state (capital organised as an imperialist force), while ensuring exploitation
and oppression of its “own” proletariat, represents on the inter-imperialist
battlefield one bourgeois faction against another, but also because, being
capital, it is by nature pro-imperialist. This “anti-imperialism” translates
into exclusive opposition towards such and such faction, such and such
institution (IMF, NATO…), such and such country, which in practice is capitalistic
and totally imperialistic.
<br>37. The essence of capitalism is invariant. All oppositions between
competitive phases and monopolistic phases, between free trade and imperialist
periods have never been anything else but the ideological cover of opportunism
in the defence of the “good side” of capitalism: “democracy”, industrialisation,
and, in reality, support to one of the blocks within the imperialist war.
<br>38. The organisation of the proletariat as an historic force requires
a structuring that is totally antagonist to these bourgeois divisions.
As the proletarian organisation will grow, it will manage to mix within
its cells proletarians from different races, cultures, sex, age and to
overstep the limits and divisions enforced by capital, to reform at last
the human world community.
<br>39. What is new about it?

<br>41. To consider that these institutions are the source of exploitation
constitutes obviously a revision, a falsification of the very concept of
exploitation, as we shall explain further in this article.
<br>42. Which is erroneously named as state capitalism, as if capitalism
changed nature due to its juridical statehood, which does not necessarily
coincide with the real concentration, centralisation and economic nationalisation
of capital, as we have already attested.
<br>43. During several proletarian insurrections such as those that occurred
in Germany in 1919, or in Spain in the 30’s, revolutionaries at war with
money and capital and imposing class violence in a city burnt money. But
that situation was totally different: it was a symbolic act, taking place
during the insurrectional full development of the revolution.
<br>44. Without insisting here on the numerous confusions that those “anarchists”
accept and that derive from the dominant ideology, we shall mention only
one: to stand against “the globalisation of markets” is significant of
huge concessions to the novelty ideology, developed by social democracy.
<br>45. It is impossible to quote here the different works of criticising
democracy in which we substantiate its key role in the capitalist domination.
We shall mention only one translated into English: “Against the myth of
democratic rights and liberties” in Communism n&deg;8.
<br>46. On this matter, read our series of articles on the 1917-1923 period
in Spanish and French (but unfortunately not yet in English): “Rusia, contrarrevoluci&oacute;n
y desarrollo del capitalismo” – “Russie, contre-r&eacute;volution et d&eacute;veloppement
du capitalisme”, and especially the articles “La concepci&oacute;n socialdemocrata
de transici&oacute;n al socialismo” – “La conception sociale-d&eacute;mocrate
de la transition au socialisme” and “Contra el mito de la transformaci&oacute;n
socialista. La politica economica y social de los bolcheviques y la continuidad
capitalista” – “Contre le mythe de la transformation socialiste. La politique
&eacute;conomique et sociale des bolch&eacute;viques”.
<br>47. Here is a quotation that needs no comment: “Anyway, the proletariat’s
program was already fulfilled by capital. The democratic universal republic,
we had it: it was the UNO (United Nations Organization) plus the IMF (International
Monetary Fund). Also the development of the productive forces: it was the
automation’s infernal cadences.
<br>48. It does not seem important, nor even relevant, to analyse any further
the fantasies of “<i>Th&eacute;orie Communiste</i>”, because this small
group of initiates took fun in redefining all the concepts, and to get
into the details would require excessively long terminological explanations.
Let us simply say that the most ludicrous aspects of their program, such
as the theory of surpassing programmatism, the historic surpassing of transition,
the theory of self-negation of the proletariat without its affirmation
as a class, derived from the fact that “program”, for “<i>Th&eacute;orie
Communiste</i>”, means the program of social democracy, “transition” means
Leninist transition, “affirmation of the proletariat” means affirmation
of the Bolshevik power in Russia… All this construction is based on social-democrat
concepts, and loses all interest as soon as those terms are defined according
to the communist critique of bolshevism, as it was the case, within the
Third International, for what was then called the German, Italian… and
generally the international Communist Left.
<br>49. It’s the same struggle as ever, that during the war, takes shape
into revolutionary defeatism. Read “The invariance of the revolutionary
position on war. The meaning of revolutionary defeatism”, in Communism
n&ordm;12.
<br>50. Centralisation of the leadership, centralized leadership does not
mean (whatever may say the anti-authoritarian ideology that prevails nowadays)
petty bosses, bureaucracy, and hierarchy as with capitalism and even in
the Marxist-Leninist or libertarian groups. On the contrary, the more decentralized
the action, the more accurately the proletariat will know where to direct
the movement. Let every part of the moment know where to concentrate its
forces and how to strike the enemy, and let them do it together. Let every
local fraction of the world proletariat was part of one and the same body,
that’s what the revolutionaries mean by “organic centralism”, opposed to
the democratic centralism of capitalism.

Dear comrades, dear readers, you might not be aware of it, but we have
done you a big favour: we read “Empire”, the stodgy book by Negri and Hardt,
which some “a<i>nti-globalisation</i>” militants have already turned into
their bible. Heavy, philosophical, and speculative, boring and irritating,
very <i>trendy</i> and, above all, completely counterrevolutionary, this
big book obviously strives to become one of the guidebooks of the anti-globalisation
struggles. In a few paragraphs, this is what Negri &amp; Hardt tell us.
<p><i>The modern epoch</i> is over. Verdun, Nazism, Hiroshima, Vietnam,
Sabra and Shatila… such<i> modernity</i> has come to the end, and is outdated.
<i>Globalisation</i>
has put an end to the power of the nation-state that was responsible for
imperialist wars and we should be happy about it. We have entered the era
of <i>post-modernism</i>.
<p>With the end of colonial regimes, and above all with the fall of the
USSR and barriers that the latter opposed to the worldwide capitalist market,
we witnessed globalisation of economical and cultural exchanges. Substituting
the nation-state, a new form of sovereignty, a new political subject appeared:
the Empire. It doesn’t refer specifically to the United States even though
that country plays a key role in the Empire and it doesn’t mean imperialism
either. “<i>The United States does not, and indeed no nation-state can
today, form the center of an imperialist project. Imperialism is over.
No nation will be world leader in the way modern European nations were.</i>”
(1) It is a “<i>de-territorialised</i>” power that extends to all social
life. “<i>(...) Empire establishes no territorial center of power and does
not rely on fixed boundaries or barriers. It is a decentered and deterritorializing
apparatus of rule that progressively incorporates the entire global realm
within its open, expanding frontiers.</i>”
<p>Contrary to the traditional left-wing that is not particularly keen
on this globalisation and would like to hinder circulation of capital,
Negri and his colleague Hardt are not opposed to the globalisation of relations,
for them, the enemy is “<i>a specific regime of global relations that we
call Empire,</i>” but “<i>(…) the fact that against the old powers of Europe
a new Empire has formed is only good news. Who wants to see any more of
that pallid and parasitic European ruling class that led directly from
the ancien r&eacute;gime to nationalism, from populism to fascism, and
now pushes for a generalized neoliberalism? Who wants to see more of those
ideologies and those bureaucratic apparatuses that have nourished and abetted
the rotting European &eacute;lites? And who can still stand those systems
of labor organization and those corporations that have stripped away every
vital spirit?</i>” Contrary to what the traditional left-wing says, the
Empire is therefore a positive reality that “<i>does away with the cruel
regimes of modern power</i>” and renders the organisation of counter-powers
by levelling reality everywhere, making it ever more
<i>supranational</i>.
The Empire makes the alternative possible, better, it creates it: the Empire
is nothing but “<i>the fabric of an ontological human dimension that tends
to be universal.</i>” That human being expresses itself in the “<i>resistances,
struggles and desires</i>” of a “<i>new proletariat</i>”, a new subject:
“<i>the multitude</i>”. “<i>The creative forces of the multitude that sustains
the Empire are also capable of autonomously constructing a counter-Empire,
an alternative political organization of global flows and exchanges. The
struggles to contest and subvert the Empire, as well as those to construct
a real alternative, will thus take place on the imperial terrain itself
- indeed, such new struggles have already  begun to emerge. Through these
struggles and many more, the multitude will have to invent new democratic
forms and a new constituent power that will one day take us through and
beyond Empire.</i>”

One of the historical characteristics of reformism is to start from revolutionary
terminology and concepts in order to subsequently redefine them and drain
them of their subversive substance. The philosophical-sociological soup
that Negri &amp; Hardt try to sell to the anti-globalisation sympathisers
is no exception to the rule: they call themselves communists, they criticise
traditional left-wing, claim allegiance to the “class struggle’s school”,
quote K. Marx at every opportunity, refer to Engels, Lenin, Debord or Foucault,
describe capitalist society and talk about variable capital, value, real
and formal subsumption, internationalism… but in the end, the fundamental
points of the communist programme, those that express the qualitative step
between capitalism and communism have vanished; no organisation in force,
no dictatorship of the proletariat, no abolition of value, no revolution.
Every concept they use is disguised as a simple programmatical extension,
a development due to the movements of history, however, with a closer look,
it becomes obvious they underwent such political deviancy that their original
revolutionary content was entirely devoid of its substance.
<p>From the very beginning of the book, the authors lay their cards on
the table. They start with recounting some aspects of capitalism history
and of class struggle and they try to demonstrate the current omnipotence
of capital on all aspects of life, but this description of capitalist dictatorship
immediately turns into a conventional reproduction of the ruling ideology.
So, in the wake of the ideologies that try to sell to the proletariat “a
new means of struggle” or “new exploitation conditions”, the Negri-Hardt
couple endeavours to portray the present symptoms of capitalist development
(monopoly tendencies, fall of the protectionist barriers, strengthening
of the free-exchange fraction, increased centralisation of the means of
repression, etc.) as a new age of capitalism: <i>globalised</i> capitalism.
Where we see nothing but the continuity of the capital’s encroachments,
the crisis intensification, the progress of capitalist barbarity, Negri
and Hardt sing along with all those who hope to serve us at all cost the
same old capitalist shit in a new tureen. According to them as well as
to Bernstein almost a century ago, there is a “new capitalism”, globalisation.
Of course they claim they criticise this “new age” but the fact is that
from the very start they leave the way open for justifications and revision
of the proletarian tasks. According to the authors, the new era that is
opening –<i>globalisation-</i> calls the proletariat to new tasks. This
will lead them, through a series of “Marxist” reasoning and developments,
to a total revision on the issue of the destruction of the state.
<p>But let’s not go too fast. This terminological stowage to <i>globalisation</i>,
to the present bourgeois ideology, is only a starter. It would never pique
the interest of the social democrat intelligentsia hanging about the anti-globalisation
movement, if it was not accompanied by some new modernity. We shall skip
the passage on the change from modern to post-modern epoch, (let us however
point out the gem defining the Empire as a positive reality that “<i>does
away with the cruel regimes of modern power</i>” and not forget the so
new symptom of a so-called “renewed interest in and effectiveness of the
concept of bellum justum,<i> </i>or ‘just war’,” supposed to be specific
to the Empire, as if every imperialist war didn’t try to define itself
that way). We shall now deal with the authors’ vision of the present struggles.
<p>For them, the present struggles “<i>under the Empire</i>” determine
“<i>not the appearance of a new cycle of internationalist struggles, but
rather the emergence of a new quality of social movements</i>”. It is logical:
if there is a <i>new capitalism</i>, there must be a<i> new quality of
social movements</i>! As always, using the excuse of a new situation, today
is disconnected from yesterday by defining “new” characteristics of the
present struggles, by giving them a “new” quality, by assigning other tasks
to the “new proletariat”, to the “multitude”. In this context, all that
relates to the analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of past struggles
becomes irrelevant to the nature and the quality of the present day struggles.
Today, no more internationalist struggles (because they would no longer
communicate horizontally, they would directly and vertically attack the
summit –the Empire- and blah blah blah). Instead, “radically different,
biopolitical movements” (economic, political and cultural, in the authors’
jargon) determined by a “new” composition of the proletariat and by the
appearance of a “new” subject: the multitude and its desires.
<p>“<i>The composition of the proletariat has transformed and thus our
understanding of it must too. In conceptual terms we understand proletariat
as a broad category that includes all those whose labor is directly or
indirectly exploited by and subjected to capitalist norms of production
and reproduction. In a previous era the category of the proletariat centered
on and was at times effectively subsumed under the industrial working class,
whose paradigmatic figure was the male mass factory worker. That industrial
working class was often accorded the leading role over other figures of
labor (such as peasant labor and reproductive labor) in both economic analyses
and political movements. (...) We need to look more concretely at the form
of the struggles in which this new proletariat expresses its desires and
needs.</i>”
<p>Let us point out that although the “new” subject –the multitude- hasn’t
been introduced yet, we are already up to the neck in the social democrat
conception of social classes. The proletariat isn’t described with regards
to its movement, in its antagonism against the bourgeoisie, to capital;
neither it is defined according to its project, its history, its party,
and its struggles. The proletariat remains a mere static object to be analysed
in its immobility and its immediacy, in the same way as it is pictured
by the whole of social democracy, just as Stalinism conceives it. According
to Negri, the central role is now played by the modern <i>immaterial</i>
labour workers vis &agrave; vis the industrial workers of old, and their
characteristics are to be “studied”. Of course, the sociology of this new
“central” exploited determines new tasks and new goals.
<p>Therefore, the authors resort to the concept of proletariat (in a static
and twisted way) but they do so only in order to end up putting forth its
opposite: the multitude. And so, from one thing leading to another, starting
with the exploited worker and the internationalist proletarian, jumping
from the industrial labour force to the immaterial one, they finally arrive
at the multitude: “<i>Does that same uncontainable desire for freedom that
broke and buried the nation-state and that determined the transition toward
Empire still live beneath the ashes of the present, the ashes of the fire
that consumed the internationalist proletarian subject that was centered
on the industrial working class? What has come to stand in the place of
that subject? In what sense can we say that the ontological rooting of
a new multitude has come to be a positive or alternative actor in the articulation
of globalization?</i>” (...) “<i>Far from being defeated, the revolutions
of the twentieth century have each pushed forward and transformed the terms
of class conflict, posing the conditions of a new political subjectivity,
an insurgent multitude against imperial power.</i>”<sup> </sup>This is
how, while fiercely professing the “school of class struggle” and the existence
of the proletariat, they take the slippery slope of the “new capitalist
conditions” to gently slide down to the “new tasks” and finally, after
passing through the “new political subjectivity”, they end up with the
dissolution of the proletariat into the multitude. Sorry, the “new” multitude!
<p>The way Negri-Hardt insist on affixing the word “new” to every concept
and the frequency with which this adjective appears in every page of the
book are proportional to the lack of “real novelty” contained in this umpteenth
reformist plea for a “world of cooperation”. The same old symptoms of the
discoverers resurface “new phases”, “new philosophies”, “new subjects”:
recuperation of all sorts of historical references, description of this
world of misery and repression, appeal to submit to the trendy reformist
movements, prediction about a world on the verge of collapse… and in the
end, no concrete means, no perspectives, no concrete directions for action.
<p>Chapters and chapters about the “world order”, the “decline of nation-state”,
the “American sovereignty and the new empire”, the “capitalist sovereignty
or the administration of global society” and, when at last, at the end
of the book, perspectives are announced… nothing, emptiness!
<p>But let us rather admire the masterpiece: “<i>It is a matter of recognizing
and engaging the imperial initiatives and not allowing them continually
to reestablish order; it is a matter of crossing and breaking down the
limits and segmentations that are imposed on the new collective labor power
</i>[another
“newness”!], <i>it is a matter of gathering together these experiences
of resistance and wielding them in concert against the nerve centers of
imperial command.</i>”
<p>After 254 pages of philosophy, the authors finally talk about concrete
action, social practice. We get to the crucial moment of the book, at the
transition between critical theory and practical action introducing the
“What is to be done?” at the qualitative step…
<p>“<i>This task for the multitude, however, although it is clear at a
conceptual level, remains rather abstract. What specific and concrete practices
will animate this political project? We cannot say at this point.</i>”
<p>A real chef d’œuvre: 265 pages of “radical thinking” to admit that they
have no idea of the “<i>specific and concrete practices that will animate
this political project</i>”… A confession of powerlessness released with
such a cheek that it would make any politician publicly commenting the
employment perspectives turn green with envy!
<p>Of course, it is not completely true, because a good reformist must
put forward one or another concrete perspective, and if one manages to
get over the disappointment induced by this confession of powerlessness,
he is nonetheless quickly given some leads. Negri and Hardt got together
to be stronger in their propositions and they kept the best part for the
end: “<i>What we can see nonetheless is a first element of a political
program for the global multitude, a first political demand: global citizenship.</i>”
<p>And there it goes! For those who might still have doubts about the counterrevolutionary,
self-managementist, intentions of the authors, all becomes clear now. Negri
&amp; Hardt demand an identity card for all, they urge to request from
every state a juridical acknowledgement of migrations, they encourage the
multitude to demand control over the migratory movements (sic), etc. “<i>The
general right to control its own movement is the multitude's ultimate demand
for global citizenship.</i>” If you didn’t understand everything, don’t
worry, neither did the authors! The important thing is to show to which
point, beyond the realm of good philosophical intentions, highbrow Marxism
doesn't have to envy the utmost vulgar reformism. Bill Clinton demands
“a universal health care card”, Toni Negri wants residency permits for
everyone, which means “<i>in the first place that all should have the full
rights of citizenship in the country where they live and work.</i>”
<p>Let us quickly leaf through the labour issue, this “<i>fundamental creative
activity of the multitude</i>” and through the right for a “<i>social wage
and a guaranteed income for all</i>”! Let us say no more. In fact we can
skip it all and rush to the conclusions of the book to get a straight idea
of up to where these Marxologists and other philosophers lead us.
<p>Of course, we could wonder if, from the communist point of view, all
this is really worth reading, analysing and criticising. Some elements
of the Negri-Hardt programme are so ridiculous this is certainly a legitimate
question. But with “Empire”, Negri and Hardt specifically target the radical
fringe of the anti-globalisation movement: the philosophy of the book is
designed to meet needs of certain <i>radicality</i> at work within the
anti-globalisation movement. It is precisely when the proletariat will
try to break away from the pacifist and/or anti-organizational ideologies
that pollute this milieu, it's at the very moment when the qualitative
step that will make the struggle against capitalism operational will be
at stake, that the ideology of “the Empire and the multitude” will play
the role of a rampart and prevent the development and the generalisation
of further ruptures. The purpose of flattering the “anti-globalisation
movement” is to submit it to its own weaknesses, to ensnare it into a merely
spectacular critique of capitalism, a critique fed by ideas as well <i>organised
and responsible</i> as the demonstrations in which they express themselves.
That is to say a “critique” that never takes action.
<p>The “radical” ideologies that tomorrow will hamper or even paralyse
the anti-capitalist movement are being shaped today. So, when the proletariat
will show its will to assault private property, they will come up with
things like: it is no longer necessary because “<i>producing increasingly
means constructing cooperation and communication commonalities</i>” and
in this sense, “<i>the concept of private property itself (…) becomes increasingly
nonsensical…</i>”; it is “<i>the community that produces and that, while
producing, is reproduced and redefined</i>” even if “<i>the juridical and
political regimes of private property</i>” have not been eliminated yet
and<i> </i>“<i>private property, despite its juridical powers, cannot help
becoming an ever more abstract and transcendental concept and thus ever
more detached from reality.</i>”And there you have it! Given that private
property does not exist anymore (or nearly so), our action can be of two
kinds: become aware and bring to the multitude the awareness that private
property has disappeared, and then demand the resignation of the empty
shells –the political and juridical regimes- that support it.
<p>“<i>(…) today we participate in a more radical and profound commonality
than has ever been experienced in the history of capitalism. (…) Our economic
and social reality is defined by (...) co-produced services and relationships.</i>”
Given that we live in co-operation, communication and community, all we
have to do is to discover that we are the real masters of the world. It
is simple, it’s all written down: “<i>The Empire pretends to be the master
of that world because it can destroy it. What a horrible illusion! In reality
we are masters of the world because our desire and labour regenerate it
continuously. (…) In biopolitical society the decision of the sovereign
can never negate the desire of the multitude.</i>”
<p>The revolutionary violence, the dictatorship of the proletariat, and
the organization of our class as a force are written off! No need for them,
since we already are the masters of the world, and the power is incapable
of denying our desires. The millions of proletarians who are dying of hunger
and anguish around the world will surely be very happy to hear this! As
they were just beginning to cast serious doubts on the capitalists’ ability
to heed their desires, Negri arrives, to dispel their fears.
<p>But Negri goes even further: he tries to recuperate Marx’s watchword
about the <i>destruction of the State</i> by amalgamating it with a claim
for
<i>self-government</i>. Of course, we have never imagined Negri as
an enemy of the State; besides, he clarified this point publicly on several
occasions. But the revision he makes here is absolutely remarkable: he
manages to have Marx say exactly the opposite of what he meant, by some
good old revisionist trick! It is almost as funny as the banknotes of the
former “socialist countries”, which displayed Marx’s face on them. Just
check it out: Negri &amp; Hardt tell us that the “Big government is over”.
First they insist on the fact that they disagree with the way the “American
conservatives” used those terms to mock the “democrats”. They nevertheless
specify that “<i>Certainly, having been educated in class struggle, we
know well that big government has also been an instrument for the redistribution
of social wealth and that, under the pressure of working class struggle,
it has served in the fight for equality and democracy.</i>” Good old social
democrat theory, according to which the state isn’t the organisation of
the ruling class as a force but a mere neutral tool that can be used by
any class of the society. No comments! But Negri goes even further: this
epoch is over. The big socialist and communist governments led to the concentration
camps… By reminding us that, 150 years ago, Marx already denounced that
all past revolutions had only improved the state rather than destroyed
it, Negri explains that the current mode of economical organisation renders
the assault against the state obsolete, useless, and that the only possibility
lies in “labour power constituting itself as a government”… which he defines
as destruction of the state. That’s it! “<i>No, we are not anarchists but
communists who have seen how much repression and destruction of humanity
has been wrought by liberal and socialist big governments. We have seen
how all this being re-created in imperial government, just when the circuits
of productive cooperation have made labour power as a whole capable of
constituting itself in government.</i>” The Negri-Hardt theories have eliminated
any reference to revolutionary violence, to the proletariat organization
as a force, to the assault on private property… and they now equate the
government of their yearning (a government of global citizenship, of active
democracy) to the destruction of the state!
<p>You can see right through it. But we have now come full cycle and can
presently sum up again the idea of the book: “Empire” seeks, throughout
its chapters, to portray the world as unified, globalised, subsumed by
an imperial order that exerts its control everywhere and nowhere at the
same time. In that world, all the levels of its constituting pyramid take
part in its reproduction. The Empire extends its domination over all aspects
of social life, but on the other side “life, desire, community” express
themselves everywhere. Labour is production of life. NGOs, for instance,
transform politics into an issue, which concerns generic life and they
extend their action on the whole of the biopolitical space. “<i>Here, at
this broadest, most universal level, the activities of these NGOs coincide
with the workings of Empire ‘beyond politics,’ on the terrain of biopower,
meeting the needs of life itself.</i>”
<p>The Empire extends its kingdom beyond the nation-state, beyond politics,
everywhere and upon everything but it cannot prevent the development of
forces developing generic life, and its sovereigns are constrained to obey
to the desires of the multitude. Empire and multitude are two coinciding
realities. Property has a mere juridical existence. Everything belongs
to the community. Little more is needed to move on to another world. We
are close to the conclusion. How? In a peaceful way, and of course, not
by seeking to take the “command”, but by self-organising as a government.
<p>Will the chapter on militancy be more explicit?
<p>“<i>We should say right away that this new militancy does not simply
repeat the organizational formulas of the old revolutionary working class.</i>”
Well, we were sure expecting something like a “new” militancy! “<i>Militants
resist imperial command in a creative way. In other words, resistance is
linked immediately with a constitutive investment in the biopolitical realm
and to the formation of cooperative apparatuses of production and community.</i>”
Did we hear “communisation”? Did we hear “self management”?
<p>“<i>There is an ancient legend that might serve to illuminate the future
life of communist militancy: that of Saint Francis of Assisi. (…) To denounce
the poverty of the multitude he adopted that common condition and discovered
there the ontological power of a new society. The communist militant does
the same…</i>”
<p>Let us mingle with the anti-globalisation sympathisers, with the NGO’s
sisters, let us work hand in hand with the cooperation priests…
<p>“<i>Once again in postmodernity we find ourselves in Francis’s situation,
posing against the misery of power the joy of being. This is a revolution
that no power will control - because biopower and communism, cooperation
and revolution remain together, in love, simplicity, and also innocence.
This is the irrepressible lightness and joy of being communist.</i>”
<p>Amen!
<p>In the end, a lot of abstractions, and a lot of religion, to worship
the present world. Just as Bernstein revealed what social democracy was
doing “silently” when claiming “aloud” that violent revolution was an outdated
idea, Negri describes the immediate reality of the so-called anti-globalisation
movement (in fact, the social democrat “anti-globalisation” practise and
ideology operating within the proletarian movements that attack capitalism).
He puts into words and perspectives the movement’s most reformist content
(NGOs, the ideology of cooperation, pacifism, charity…), flirts with its
self-management tendencies, praises its worst weaknesses and finally sells
the image of its own misery: lack of revolutionary subject, exaltation
of the “refusal”, pacifism, ideology of conscience-bringing, self-management
and self-government, Consequence: his book is an excellent theorization
of the reformism present in today’s movements.
<p>No revolutionary action, the monopoly of violence surrendered into the
hands of the state, no attack against private property, value, no confrontation
with the antagonist class, no organization… just a bit of NGOs, a bit of
claiming for a worldwide citizenship and a real democracy, a bit of confused
ethics and philosophy, a bit of love for the multitude, a bit of commiseration
and a lot, an awful lot of idealism and self management.
<p>In short, we started with a denunciation of the reinforcement of the
capitalist control over the human beings and we ended up with a claim for
“<i>an organization of productive and political power as a biopolitical
unity managed by the multitude, organized by the multitude, directed by
the multitude - absolute democracy in action.</i>” In the most genuine
populist tradition of left-wing capitalism and Stalinism (which the authors
claim they reject), they started from the proletariat and ended up denying
its historical role and praising its dissolution into a peaceful and democratic
multitude.

<h3>
An Open Letter to Students by Workers in Athens</h3>
December 16<sup>th</sup> 2008
<p>Our age difference and the general estrangement make it difficult for
us to discuss with you in the streets; this is why we send you this letter.
<p>Most of us have not (yet) been bald or big-bellied. We are part of the
1990-91 movement. You must have heard of it. Back then, and while we had
occupied our schools for 30-35 days, fascists killed a teacher because
he had gone beyond his natural role (that of being our guard) and crossed
the line to the opposite side; he had come with us, into our struggle.
Then, even the toughest of us got to the streets and riot. However, we
didn’t even think of doing what you easily do today: attack police stations
(although we sang “burn police stations…”).
<p>So, you’re gone beyond us, as always happens in history. Conditions
are different of course. During ‘90s they passed us off the prospect of
personal success and some of us swallowed it. Now people cannot believe
this fairy tale. Your older brothers showed us this during the 2006-07
students’ movement; you now spit their fairy tale to their faces.
<p>So far so good.
<p>Now the good and difficult matters begin.
<p>We’ll tell you what we’ve learned from our struggles and our defeats
(because as long as world is not ours we’ll always be the defeated ones)
and you can use what we’ve learned as you wish:
<p>Don’t stay alone. Call us; call as many people as possible. We don’t
know how you can do that, you will find the way. You’ve already occupied
your schools and you tell us that the most important reason is that you
don’t like your schools. Nice. Since you’ve already occupied them change
their role. Share your occupations with other people. Let your schools
become the first buildings to house our new relations. Their most powerful
weapon is dividing us. Just like you are not afraid of attacking their
police stations because you are together, don’t be afraid to call us to
change our life all together.
<p>Don’t listen to any political organization (either anarchists or anyone).
Do what you need to. Trust people, not abstract schemes and ideas. Trust
your direct relations with people. Trust your friends; make as many people
as possible in your struggle your people. Don’t listen to them when they’re
saying that your struggle doesn’t have a political content and must seemingly
obtain. Your struggle is the content. You only have your struggle and it’s
in your hands to preserve its advance. It’s only your struggle that can
change your life, namely you and the real relations with your fellowmen.
<p>Don’t be afraid to proceed when confronting new things. Each one of
us, as we’re getting older, has things planted in their brains. You too,
although you are young. Don’t forget the importance of this fact.
<p>Back in 1991, we confronted the smell of the new world and, trust us,
we found it difficult. We learned that there must always be limits. Don’t
be scared by the destruction of commodities. Don’t be scared by people
looting stores. We make all these, they are ours. You (just like we in
the past) are raised to get up every morning in order to make things that
they will later not be yours. Let’s get them back all together and share
them. Just like we share our friends and the love among us.
<p>We apologize for writing this letter quickly, but we do it swinging
the lead from our work, secretly from our boss. We are imprisoned in work,
just like you are imprisoned in school.
<p>We’ll now lie to our boss and leave work: we’ll come to meet you in
Syntagma sq with stones in our hands.

INVITATION TO THE OPEN POPULAR ASSEMBLY OF THE LIBERATED CITY HALL OF AGHIOS
DIMITRIOS</h3>
On December 6<sup>th</sup>, 2008, the special guard Epaminondas Korkoneas
pulled out his gun and murdered a citizen, a 16-year old kid. The rage
that everyone feels is huge, despite all the attempts by the government
and the mass media to disorient public opinion.
<p>It is now certain that this insurrection is not only homage to the unjust
loss of Alexandros Grigoropoulos. There has been a lot of talk since then
about violence, thefts and pillages. For those in the media and power,
violence is only what destroys the proper order.
<p><b>For us however:</b>
<p><b>Violence is</b> to work 40 years for crumbs and to wonder if you
will ever retire.
<br><b>Violence is</b> the bonds, the stolen pensions, the securities fraud.
<br><b>Violence is</b> to be forced to take a housing loan that you will
pay back through the nose.
<br><b>Violence is</b> the managerial right of the employer to fire you
at will.
<br><b>Violence is</b> unemployment, temporary employment, 700 euros a
month.
<br><b>Violence is</b> the “industrial accidents” because the bosses cut
costs at the expense of worker safety.
<br><b>Violence is</b> to take psycho-medications and vitamins to withstand
the exhaustive work schedule.
<br><b>Violence is</b> to be an immigrant, to live with the fear that you
can be thrown out of the country at any time and to be in a state of constant
insecurity.
<br><b>Violence is</b> to be simultaneously a wage worker, a housewife,
and a mother.
<br><b>Violence is</b> to be worked to death and then to be told "smile,
we are not asking that much of you."
<p>The insurrection of high-school and university students, of temporary
workers and immigrants broke this violence of normality. This insurrection
must not stop! Syndicalists, political parties, priests, journalists and
businesspeople do whatever they can to maintain the violence we described
above.
<p>It is not just them, but we too are responsible for the perpetuation
of this situation. The insurrection opened a space where we can finally
express ourselves freely. As a continuation of this opening we went forward
with the occupation of the City Hall of Ag. Dimitrios and the formation
of a popular assembly open to all.

<h3>
WE DESTROY THE PRESENT BECAUSE WE COME FROM THE FUTURE</h3>
"The first dawning light comes out of the deepest darkness"
<p>Up until the Saturday night of 06/12/08 we could say that "<b>jusqu'ici
tout va bien</b>", watching everyone's personal fall into the desert of
the capitalist system. Then the crash came, and the destructive madness
seized large parts of the youth of the country. At first, like so many
times in history, it was the actions that did the talking. First the cop
gun talked, shouting in the crudest manner the repulsion of Authority of
every kind toward the phenomenon of life. The blood of a teenager was spilt,
and immediately another cry instantly transmitted from Exarchia to the
economic center of the metropolis and other big cities, a cry made out
of collapsing glass and flames, transforming banks and malls into a raging
cloud with the inscription:
<b>REVENGE</b>.
<p>Two days later the christmas centers of the cities looked as if they
had been the targets of <b>war bombing</b>, while the already crisis-ridden
economy took another deadly blow in its heart by hordes of "hooligans"
looting commodities. "The Varkiza Treaty is broken, we are at war again".
<b>We
are talking about the return of class struggle to the foreground, we are
talking about the solution to the crisis</b>: For us. And we're only getting
started. Let's go…
<p><b>We are part of the revolt of life against the daily death the existing
social relations impose on us.</b> With the destructive power that was
latent in us we realize a wild (but contradictory) attack on the institution
of private property. We occupy the streets, we breathe freely despite the
tear gas, attacking the most despiteful image of ourselves: the image of
ourselves as the bosses' slaves, that in its most extreme, most repugnant
form is the cop. We erect a steadfast barricade against the loathsome normality
of the cycle of production and distribution. In the current conjunction,
nothing is more important than consolidating this barricade against the
class enemy. Even if we retreat under the pressure of the (para-) state
scum and the insufficiency of the barricade, we all know that nothing will
ever be the same in our lives.
<p>We also position ourselves in the historical conjunction of the recomposition
of a new class subject, that carries from long ago the promise of assuming
the role of the gravedigger of the capitalist system. We believe that <b>the
proletariat was never a class because of its position; on the contrary,
it constitutes itself as a class for itself on the ground of the clash
with the bosses</b>, first acting and only later gaining consciousness
of its actions. The recomposition is taking place by groups of subjects
that become aware that they have no control over their own lives, from
groups that have been -or are getting- squeezed on the bottom of the barrel,
and are now entering a contradictionary trajectory toward unification.
<p>Wage work has always been a blackmail. Nowadays this holds even more,
as the number of workers that are employed only circumstantially and precariously
in sectors which, while necessary for the reproduction of capitalist domination
have no social usefulness whatsoever, is also growing. <b>In these sectors,
class struggles, exiled from the field of self-management of production,
move into the field of the generalized blocking and sabotage. </b>Simultaneously,
the automatization of production and the abandonment of the politics of
full employment create whole reserve armies of jobless proletarians who
are pushed to the fringes of society and resort to insecured labor or turn
to crime economy in order to survive. Jobless, precarious workers, highschool
and university students destined to become future wage slaves, migrant
workers of the first and second generation that daily live the marginalization
and the repression constituted along with radical workers' minorities the
<b>community
of the insurgents of December</b>, a community based on the common condition
of alienation and exploitation that defines a society based on commodity-work.
Let's remind ourselves that<b> the eve of this feast-day was celebrated
from those even lower, from those who have lost every joy in the places
of torment of democracy, from the prisoners of the Greek prisons.</b>
<p>The owners of the commodity labor-power who had it invested in the stock
exchange of social security and in the hope of seeing their offspring exiting
this condition through social ascension, continue to observe the insurrectionary
party without taking part, but also without calling the police to dissolve
it. Along with <b>the substitution of social security with police security
and the collapse of the stock market of class movability</b>, many workers,
under the burden of the collapsing universe of petit-bourgeois ideology
and the state hybris, are moving toward a (socially important) moral justification
of the youth outbreak, but without yet joining the attack against this
murderous world.
<p>They kept on dragging their corpse on three-month litanies of the professional
unionists and on defending a sad sectional defeatism against the raging
class aggressiveness that is rapidly coming to the fore. <b>These two worlds
met up on Monday, 8/12, on the streets, and the entire country caught on
fire</b>. The world of the sectional defeatism took the streets to defend
the democratic right of the separated roles of the citizen, the worker,
the consumer, to participate in demonstrations without getting shot at.
Nearby, not that far away, the world of class aggressiveness took the streets
in the form of small organized "gangs" that break, burn, loot, smash the
pavements to throw stones onto the murderers. The first world (at least
as expressed in the politics of the professional unionists) was so scared
by the presence of the second, that on Wednesday, 10/12, attempted to demonstrate
without the annoying presence of the "riff-raff". The dilemma regarding
how to be on the streets was already layed in: <b>Either with the democratic
safety of the citizen, or with the clash solidarity of the group, the aggressive
block, the march that defends everyone's existence with sharp attacks and
barricades.</b>
<p>The December events ("Dekemvriana") of 2008 in Greece are the latest
link in a series of insurrections that are sweeping through the capitalist
world.
<b>In its decadent phase, capitalist society neither can, nor does
it aim at gaining the consent of the exploited through the integration
of partial demands. All that remains is is repression.</b> With the restructuring
that began in the mid-seventies (to repel the proletarian mutiny that is
known as "movement-68"), capital faced the following contradiction: while
it had the ability to create a human mass of passive tv-viewers and commodity-consumers,
it had to simultaneously refuse them (by lowering their wages) the possibility
of buying these commodities. From this point of view, the looting of a
mall in Stadiou str. by people who are daily sharing the promises of a
false consumer happiness, while being refused the means to realize these
promises, shouldn't come out as a surprise.
<p>The insurrection of December didn't put out any concrete demands, exactly
because the participating subjects daily experience, and therefore know
the denial of the ruling class to meet any such demand. The wisperings
of the left, that initially demanded the removal of the government were
replaced by a mute terror and a desperate attempt to relieve the uncontrollable
insurrectionary wave. <b>The absence of any reformist demand whatsoever
reflects an underground (but still unconscious) disposition toward a radical
subversion and surpassing of the existing commodity relations and the creation
of qualitatively now ones.</b>
<p>Everything begins and matures in violence – but nothing stops there.
The destructive violence that unleashed in the events of December caused
the blocking of the capitalist normality in the center of the metropolis,
a necessary yet insufficient condition for the transforming of the insurrection
into an attempt for social liberation. The destabilation of capitalist
society is impossible without paralysing the economy – that is, without
disrupting the function of the centers of production and distribution,
through sabotage, occupations, strikes. <b>The absence of a positive, creative
proposal for a different form of organizing the social relations was –up
until now– more than self-evident</b>. Nevertheless, the insurrection of
December must be understood within the historical context of an enlivement
process of class struggle that takes place on the international level.
<p>A series of <b>struggle practices</b> – some have surfaced in elementary
form in many countries where significant class conflicts took place recently
– propose and realize in a germinal level the <b>human community</b> that
abolishes and creatively transcends the alienated commodity relations:
<b>occupied
schools</b> can be used as regrouping centers to reclaim the streets and
the public space in general; <b>public anti-lessons</b> organized within
the context of the recent movement of precarious workers/students in Italy,
putting knowledge under the service of the <b>forming community</b>;
<b>collective
appropriations</b> of supermarkets and bookstores, and the
<b>collective
life</b> in the occupation as a self-fullfilment of the demands for free
feeding, housing, books; <b>the radical contestation of the property relations</b>,
cooperation instead of personal appropriation (and sometimes reselling)
of the appropriated commodities; <b>neighborhood assemblies linking up</b>,
starting from the local issues, prefiguring thus a society where decisions
are taken and are executed without the mediation of any separated power
whatsoever (sf. Oaxaca); <b>free transportations</b> with the public transportation,
the d&eacute;m&eacute;nages (invading into employment agencies and throwing
all their stuff into the street) as were systematically made during the
anti-CPE movement in France. These (and countless others, that can be born
out of the personal and collective intelligence) are the practises that
can enrich and fertilize the powers of negation, so that through the turmoil
of insurrection, the <b>free, communist society</b> will start to take
shape.
<p>We do everything within our reach not to abandon the occupations and
the streets, because we don't want to go home. We get miserable and unhappy
with the "realistic" thought that sooner or later we will have to return
to normality.
<b>We get full of joy with the thought that we are in the
beginning of a historical process of enlivenment of class struggle</b>,
and that if we want to, if we fight for it, if we believe in it, it can
lead us out of the crisis, into the revolutionary getaway from the system.

<h3>
A Bedouin anytime! A citizen never.</h3>
Having by our late labours and hazards made it appear to the world at how
high a rate we value our just freedom (…) we do now hold our selves bound
in mutual duty to each other, to take the best care we can for the future,
to avoid the danger of returning into a slavish condition.
<p>- Levellers, An Agreement of the People, 1647
<p>Let’s look beyond the tear gas, the baton sticks and the riot police
vans: The operation being conducted by the bosses since December 6th doesn’t
comprise a mere combination of repression and propaganda; rather, it is
the application of a series of methods aiming to re-negotiate social peace
and consensus.
<p>From the communist party, which views the revolted people as puppets
of syriza (the euro-left parliamentary party – transl.) and of cia, all
the way to socialist party politicians moaning that Athens resembles a
city of the Eastern Block, what with its streets empty from consumers.
From the archbishop of Thessaloniki, who begs his flock to go shopping
and the city’s international exposition offering free parking to Christmas
shoppers, they all hold a common target: The return to the normality of
democracy and consumption. Thus the day after the revolt, which happens
to coincide with a dead consumer feast such as Christmas, is accompanied
by the demand that this must celebrated at all cost: not only in order
for some tills to fill up but in order for us all to return to our graves.
The day after holds the demand of the living dead that nothing disturbs
their eternal sleep no more. It holds a moratorium legitimising the emptiness
of their spectacle-driven world, a world of quiet and peaceful life. And
the generals of this war hold no weapon that is more lethal than the appeal
to that absolute, timeless idea: democracy.
<p>The word-for-democracy, developing as it does ever more densely from
the side of the demagogues of calmness, aims at the social imaginary –
the collective field of structuring of desires and fears. It aims, in other
words, at the field where procedures invisibly take place that can secure
or threaten order and its truth. Everyone knew, well before the assassination
of Alexis, that the oligarchy of capital had given up on trying even to
seem democratic, even by bourgeois terms: economic scandals, blatant incidents
of police violence, monstrous laws. Yet this fact is not, neither here
nor anywhere else, what might worry the bosses. This is precisely because
the constant reproduction of the establishment under such terms (“is it
democratic enough? Is it really democratic?”) reproduces the capitalist
oligarchy that builds around it a wall of scandals, remorses, resignations,
demands and reforms – preventing, in this way, the questioning of (not
the democratic qualities of the regime but) democracy as a system of social
organising. Hence bosses can still appeal to this higher value today, this
axiomatic mechanism of the political, in order to bring us back to normality,
consensus, compromise. In order to assimilate the general spontaneous rage
in the sphere of mediation before this rage can organise itself into a
revolutionary potential which would swoop all and any intermediaries and
peaceful democrats – bringing along a new form of organising: the commune.
<p>Amidst this ludicrous climate of shallow analyses the salaried officials
of the psychological warfare point at the revolted, howling: “That’s not
democratic, that ignores the rules under which our democracy functions”.
We cannot help but momentarily stand speechless in the face of what we
would until recently have considered impossible. Even if having the intention
to deceive, the bosses of this country have said something true: We despise
democracy more than anything else in this decadent world. For what is democracy
other than a system of discriminations and coercions in the service of
property and privacy? And what are its rules, other than rules of negotiation
of the right to own – the invisible rules of alienation? Freedom, rights
equality, egalitarianism: all these dead ideological masks together cannot
cover their mission: the generalisation and preservation of the social
as an economic sphere, as a sphere where not only what you have produced
but also what you are and what you can do are already alienated. The bourgeois,
with a voice trembling from piety, promise: rights, justice, equality.
And the revolted hear: repression, exploitation, looting. Democracy is
the political system where everyone is equal in front of the guillotine
of the spectacle-product. The only problem that concerned democrats, from
Cromwell to Montesquieu, is what form of property is sufficient in order
for someone to be recognised as a citizen, what kind of rights and obligations
guarantee that they will never understand themselves as something beyond
a private citizen. Everything else is no more than adjusting details of
a regime in the service of capital.
<p>Our despise for democracy does not derive from some sort of idealism
but rather, from our very material animosity for a social entity where
value and organising are centered around the product and the spectacle.
The revolt was by definition also a revolt against property and alienation.
Anyone that didn’t hide behind the curtains of their privacy, anyone who
was out on the streets, knows it only too well: Shops were looted not for
computers, clothes or furniture to be resold but for the joy of destructing
what alienates us: the spectacle of the product. Anyone who doesn’t understand
why someone delights in the sight of a destructed product is a merchant
or a cop. The fires that warmed the bodies of the revolted in these long
December nights were full of the liberated products of our toil, from the
disarmed symbols of what used to be an almighty fantasy. We simply took
what belonged to us and we threw it to the fire together with all its co-expressions.
The grand potlatch of the past few days was also a revolt of desire against
the imposed rule of scarcity. A revolt of the gift against the sovereignty
of money. A revolt of the anarchy of use value against the democracy of
exchange value. A revolt of spontaneous collective freedom against rationalised
individual coercion.

<h3>
THEIR DEMOCRACY MURDERS…</h3>
On Saturday December 6, 2008, Alexandros Grigoropoulos, a 15-year old comrade,
was murdered in cold blood, with a bullet in the chest by the cop Epaminondas
Korkoneas of the special guards’ police force in the area of Exarchia.
<p>Contrary to the statements of politicians and journalists who are accomplices
to the murder, this was not an “isolated incident”, but an explosion of
the state repression which systematically and in an organised manner targets
those who resist, those who revolt, the anarchists and antiauthoritarians.
It is the peak of state terrorism which is expressed with the upgrading
of the role of repressive mechanisms, their continuous armament, the increasing
levels of violence they use, with the doctrine of “zero tolerance”, with
the slandering media propaganda that criminalizes those who are fighting
against authority.
<p>It is these conditions that prepare the ground for the intensification
of repression, attempting to extract social consent beforehand, and arming
the weapons of state murderers in uniform that are targeting the people
who fight, the youth, the damned who are revolting in the entire country.
Lethal violence against the people in the social and class struggle is
aiming at everybody’s submission, serving as exemplary punishment, meant
to spread fear.
<p>It is the escalation of the generalized attack of the state and the
bosses against the whole of society, in order to impose more rigid conditions
of exploitation and oppression, to consolidate control and repression.
An attack that is reflected everyday on poverty, social exclusion, the
blackmail to adjust in the world of social and class divisions, the ideological
war launched by the dominant mechanisms of manipulation (the mass media).
An attack which is raging in every social space, demanding from the oppressed
their division and silence. From the schools’ cells and the universities
to the dungeons of waged slavery with the hundreds of dead workers in the
so-called “working accidents” and the poverty embracing large numbers of
the population… From the minefields in the borders, the pogroms and the
murders of immigrants and refugees to the numerous “suicides” in prisons
and police stations… from the “accidental shootings” in police blockades
to violent repression of local resistances, Democracy is showing its teeth!
<p>In these conditions of fierce exploitation and oppression, and against
the daily looting and pillage that the state and the bosses are launching,
taking as spoils the oppressed people’s labour force, their life, their
dignity and freedom, the accumulated social suffocation is accompanying
today the rage erupting in the streets and the barricades for the murder
of Alexandros.
<p>From the first moment after the murder of Alexandros, spontaneous demonstrations
and riots appear in the centre of Athens, the Polytechnic, the Economic
and the Law Schools are being occupied and attacks against state and capitalist
targets take place in many different neighbourhoods and in the city centre.
Demonstrations, attacks and clashes erupt in Thessaloniki, Patras, Volos,
Chania and Heraklion in Crete, in Giannena, Komotini, Xanthi, Serres, Sparti,
Alexandroupoli, Mytilini. In Athens, in Patission Street -outside the Polytechnic
and the Economic School- clashes last all night. Outside the Polytechnic
the riot police make use of plastic bullets.
<p>On Sunday the 7th December, thousands of people demonstrate towards
the police headquarters in Athens, attacking the riot police. Clashes of
unprecedented tension spread in the streets of the city centre, lasting
until late at night. Many demonstrators are injured and a number of them
are arrested.
<p>From Monday morning until today the revolt spreads and becomes generalized.
The last days are full of uncountable social events: militant high school
students’ demonstrations ending up -in many cases- in attacks against police
stations and clashes with the cops in the neighbourhoods of Athens and
in the rest of the country, massive demonstrations and conflicts between
protestors and the police in the centre of Athens, during which there are
assaults in banks, big department stores and ministries, siege of the Parliament
in Syntagma square, occupations of public buildings, demonstrations ending
in riots and attacks against state and capitalist targets in many different
cities. (...)
<p>The bullets of the murderers in uniform, the arrests and beatings of
demonstrators, the chemical gas war launched by the police forces, the
ideological attack of Democracy not only cannot manage to impose fear and
silence, but they become for the people the reason to raise against state
terrorism the cries of the struggle for freedom, to abandon fear and to
meet –more and more every day, youth, high school and university students,
immigrants, jobless, workers- in the streets of revolt. To let the rage
overflow and drown them!
