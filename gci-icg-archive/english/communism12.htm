The position of revolutionaries confronted with capitalist war is always
the same: <i>to oppose social revolution to war, to struggle against "their
own" bourgeoisie and "their own" national state</i>. Historically, this
position is called <i>revolutionary defeatism</i> because it openly proclaims
that the proletariat must struggle against the enemy which is in its "own"
country, that it must act so as to bring about its defeat and that it is
only in this way that it participates in the revolutionary unification
of the world proletariat, it is only in this way that proletarian revolution
can develop across the world.
<p>From the origins of the workers' movement, the question of <i>war and
revolution</i>, the question of the opposition between war and revolution,
is central. Effectively, it is in a period <i>of war and revolution</i>
(and history shows us the interaction between the two poles) that we can
see most clearly who is on one side of the barricades and who is on the
other. Throughout history the position on war and revolution has been the
culminating point at which various forces and parties calling themselves
revolutionary (or socialist, or anarchist, or communist...) have been unmasked
and have finally been forced to reveal their counter-revolutionary face
(1) in their affirmations that such and such a war was a just war, that
a particular country was the victim of aggression, that they were opposed
to war but only in certain circumstances, that they support the liberation
of some nation against some other...
<p>By contrast, no doubt is possible from a <i>revolutionary</i> point
of view. There is no need to wait for war to be declared to understand
its nature, no need for the geopolitical speculations which are fashionable
amongst bourgeois intellectuals or in cultured journals like <i>Le Monde
Diplomatique</i>. Declarations made by the two protagonists in the name
of peace which define who is the "aggressor" and who is the "victim" don't
matter much. <i>Like all the programmatic positions of communism, the position
of revolutionaries confronting war between bourgeois states (or nationalist
fractions which claim autonomy or independence) is simple and decisive:</i>
<ul>
<li>
there is no such thing as a just war</li>

<li>
there is no such thing as a defensive war</li>

<li>
all wars of national liberation are inter-imperialist (and therefore imperialist)</li>

<li>
there is no camp which is for peace while another is for war</li>

<li>
there is no camp which represents barbarism while the other represents
civilisation</li>

<li>
there is no camp which is more aggressive than the other</li>

<li>
there is no democratic camp against a dictatorial or fascist camp...or
the other way round.</li>
</ul>
The opposites of all these formulae are used indiscriminately by the two
capitalist camps with the aim of recruiting for their war (2).
<p>The classic position of revolutionaries is to oppose <i>any war between
nation states</i> with all their might. It is not based on an idea that
we have about how we would like the world to be, an "idea" which constitutes
the common denominator of the pacifists who, in the name of eternal peace,
inevitably end up in one or other camp of capitalist war, ratifying their
vocation as defenders of the "peace of the grave". On the contrary, this
position comes from the <i>material interests of the proletariat</i>, from
the fact that its general antagonism to capital is not an opposition to
such and such a bourgeois fraction according to the government policy of
the moment, but an opposition to the whole of the bourgeoisie, whatever
its policies. Our practical antagonism to all war between states is the
inevitable consequence of the fact that our interests are not opposed to
the bourgeoisie because they are "fascists" or "democrats", on the right
or on the left, national imperialists or imperialist nationals, but purely
and simply because they are bourgeois. Our opposition is the consequence
of an incontestable truth: between exploiter and exploited there cannot
be any unity which doesn't benefit the former. Any front or critical support
for one camp against another benefits the bourgeoisie against the proletariat.
<p>Each class acts in accord with its interests and its fundamental programme.
Capital is nothing more than capitals confronting each other. Capital itself
contains the war between capitals, and it is precisely because of that
that all the bourgeois fractions, whatever they might say, participate
in one way or another in commercial and military wars which derive from
the very nature of value in struggle against other values so as to valorise
itself.
<p>In the same way, <i>the proletariat can only act as a class</i> in refusing
to serve as cannon fodder in national wars. It is not a question of one
choice amongst others but of <i>its existence as a class</i>: it has no
particular or regional interest to defend which opposes it to other proletarians
- on the contrary, each faction of the prooletariat, however limited its
class action against capital might be, contains universality, expresses
the interests of humanity by opposing every war.
<p>You can reply to us that in numerous national wars proletarians have
participated in and supported one or other camp. It's true, but they are
not acting in accord with their own interests, they are acting precisely
on the basis of the ideological domination of the dominant class. They
are not acting <i>as a worldwide class but as cannon fodder</i> for the
bourgeoisie. They are not acting as a revolutionary class but <i>are negating
themselves as a class</i> and adhering to the people, to the nation, which
is the very negation of the proletariat ("the proletariat has no country").
Bourgeois war, with massive and popular participation (as for example in
the so-called Second World War) is the direct liquidation of the proletariat,
of the very subject of revolution, to the benefit of capital. Therefore,
beyond the subjective interests pursued by each capitalist, each bourgeois
fraction in the commercial and then military war, capital in its entirety
has an <i>objective</i> interest in the war: the destruction of the very
subject of revolution, the disappearance, sometimes for a long historical
period, of communism as a force.
<p>Faced with this, the development of the proletariat as a class starts
from life itself. In effect, our struggle begins with our very existence
as a class, by our confrontation, from our birth, with private property,
capital and the state. The positions that we have as organised proletarians
do not start out from consideration of what the existing camps say but
from our permanent confrontation with exploitation, with the inhuman conditions
of life that the system imposes on us and which reach their highest level
of inhumanity during wars.
<p>Because war is the very essence of this society, because capital cannot
live without periodic wars and its cycle of life is based on successive
destruction of productive forces, the only real, radical and profound opposition
to war is revolutionary opposition. Only social revolution will definitively
put an end to war, for all time.
<p>That is why the cry of revolutionaries in the face of war has always
been: <i>"turn the imperialist war into a social war for universal revolution"</i>.
<p>In isolation, this slogan has nevertheless been revealed as historically
insufficient because real opposition to war and to international capital
means in practice an open opposition to the bourgeoisie and the state which,
in every camp, recruits for the war. That opposition expresses itself very
practically because the bourgeoisie knows how to use the <i>whole terrorist
arsenal of its state</i> to impose recruitment and adherence to the war:
"state of war" police measures, generalised censorship, general mobilisation,
nationalist fanaticism (racism, xenophobia, religious sectarianism), the
repression of revolutionaries accused of supporting the opposing camp (accusations
of espionage) or "high treason", etc. (3)
<p>In such circumstances, to declare oneself against the war and the bourgeoisie
in general, without taking a concrete action against the increase of exploitation
that all war generates is only a simple propaganda formula and not a <i>revolutionary
direction for action</i>. In effect, bourgeois war concretises itself above
all else as <i>the war of a state against "its" proletariat</i>, that is
to say against the proletariat of that country, to grind it down, to liquidate
the revolutionary minorities and to drag it progressively into the bourgeois
war. This shows that it is indispensable, inescapable, indisputable to
assert the fact that
<i>"the enemy is in our own country"</i>, that it
is <i>"our own bourgeoisie"</i>, <i>"our own state"</i>. It is in the struggle
to bring about the <i>defeat</i> of "its own" bourgeoisie, of "its own"
state that the proletariat really assumes <i>internationalist</i> solidarity
with the world revolution. Or, to speak from a more global point of view,
the world revolution is constituted precisely in the generalisation of
the <i>revolutionary defeatism</i> of the world proletariat.
<p>More than this, the proletariat "of" such or such a country (4) cannot
deal a class blow to "its" bourgeoisie and "its" state, nor extend the
hand of solidarity to its class brothers and sisters in the "other camp"
who are also at war with "their" bourgeoisie and "their" state, without
committing an <i>"act of high treason", without contributing to the defeat
of "its own army"</i>, without acting overtly to degrade the army of "its
own country". What's more, revolutionary defeatism concretises itself not
only by fraternity between fronts with the soldiers (proletarians in uniform)
of the "other camp" (the only aspect accepted by centrism) but also by
the concrete action of <i>destruction of "its own" army</i>.
<p>Historically, revolutionaries have also distinguished themselves from
centrists by their appeal for the independent organisation of soldiers
against officers, for the leadership which they give to the concrete action
of sabotaging the army, by the call to shoot "your own officers" (and by
their energetic struggle to put this into practice), by the fact of turning
rifles away from the "external enemy" and pointing them at the "officers"
of the fatherland.
<p>In fact the experience of war and revolution, and in particular the
concrete experience of what is called the "First" world war has allowed
us to clarify the point that the call for revolutionary struggle against
bourgeois war is completely insufficient and centrist in practice if it
is not accompanied by its practical concretisation, that is to say open
struggle against "its own" bourgeoisie, for the defeat of "its own" state.
In all cases, "the war against the foreigner" means above all else "war
against the proletariat" of that country. In fact if you practically oppose
a general mobilisation led by one bourgeois or one concrete national state,
to say that you are struggling "against all the bourgeoisie whoever they
are", or to appeal to "revolutionary struggle against the war" without
acting concretely for the defeat of "your own" country is equivalent to
falling into <i>propagandism (5) and playing the game of chauvinism</i>.
<p>During the so-called First world war, the Centre of the Second International
(in opposition to its Right which declared itself for "defence of the nation")
claimed to oppose revolution to war and launched slogans as radical as
"war on war". But, at the same time, it opposed revolutionary defeatist
calls because, so they said, (like all the army generals!) that would benefit
the national enemy, and so they ended up proposing slogans like "neither
victory nor defeat".
<p>We mustn't forget that no fraction of the bourgeoisie has ever declared
itself in favour of war, they all claim to be fighting for peace, and the
generals themselves know that peace <i>is nothing other than a fundamental
weapon of war</i>. When the social democrats, like E. David, vote for war
credits (6), it is not in the name of war, but in the name of peace and
to "prevent defeat". Here is how E. David justified his vote: <i>"the purpose
of our vote of 4 August is the following: not for war but against defeat"</i>.
It is clear that in the face of a war which concretised itself as a war
between the proletariat and "its own" state, the classic position of bourgeois
socialism, as well as the position which pronounces "neither victory nor
defeat", would disorganise the proletariat and help lead it to butchery.
<p>On this question, Lenin rallied the "International communist left" who
opposed themselves to the centrist position dominant in the international
conferences (of Kiental and Zimmerwald). Beyond the fetishism of the individual,
and despite all the critiques that we have made of Lenin, we don't hesitate
in quoting him in the years when he effectively concurred with the critique
made by revolutionaries and when, in practice, he took a position against
social democratic centrism:
<p><i>"The 'revolutionary struggle against war' is only one of the empty
exclamations without content on which the heroes of the Second International
are experts if through them we don't understand revolutionary actions against
the government itself in times of war. It is sufficient to meditate for
one moment to understand it thus. But, in times of war, revolutionary actions
against the government itself mean undoubtedly and indissolubly not only
that one wants the defeat of the government but also that one contributes
in a active fashion to that defeat...</i>
<p><i>In times of war, the revolution is a civil war, and, in part, the
transformation of a war between governments into civil war is facilitated
by the military reversals (by "defeat") of governments, and, also, it is
impossible to contribute practically to that transformation if one does
not contribute at the same time to defeat... If the chauvinists (such as
the Committee of Organisation and the Chjeidze fraction) reject the "call"
for defeat it is only because it is the only call which appeals in a consequent
fashion for revolutionary actions against its own government during the
war. Because, if there is no revolutionary action, the thousands of ultra-revolutionary
phrases on the struggle "against the war and the conditions etc..." are
worth nothing. The adversaries of the call for defeat are purely and simply
afraid of themselves because they do not dare to look in the face the fact
that there exists an indissociable relation between revolutionary agitation
and the necessary contribution to defeat... Someone who defends the call
for "neither victory nor defeat" is a chauvinist consciously or unconsciously.
In the best case, they are a petty bourgeois conciliator but, in every
way, they are an enemy of proletarian politics, a partisan of existing
governments and of the existing dominant classes..."</i> (7)
<p>We can note here that <i>revolutionary defeatism</i> (opposing the social
revolution to war), that concretisation of the position revolutionaries
always hold, doesn't come in any way from an ideological speculation on
the policy of this or that bourgeois fraction but from the very essence
of the proletariat, from its vital needs. In effect, the struggle of the
proletariat, the totality of the programmatic content of the communist
revolution emerges from the struggle against exploitation. It is the most
natural thing that when the proletariat is confronted with war it not only
does not abandon the permanent struggle against exploitation (the struggle
against "its own" bosses, against "its own" bourgeoisie, against "its own"
unions, against "its own" government) but that it intensifies it because
war always implies that the conditions of exploitation and, in general,
<i>all
the conditions of life (and struggle) brutally worsen</i>. It will be the
same bourgeois, the same trade unionists, the same politicians and governments
who, without exception, try to make the proletariat forget these conditions
of life and demand more sacrifices, more work for less pay, and plenty
of other things which, according to country and circumstances, will range
from voluntary collections for the front to ministerial decrees imposing
days of forced labour to support the war effort and the levying of a percentage
of wages to be contributed to the war effort of the "nation" (Saddam Hussein
managed to sometimes impose a month of unpaid work to finance his war!).
In these circumstances, while nationalism attacks the proletariat, centrism
tries to weaken the immediate revolutionary struggle (8) against the sectors
of the bourgeoisie which directly impose war sacrifices. To do this it
doesn't hesitate in launching vague slogans concerning the opposition of
the revolution to war in general, arguing that we mustn't play into the
hands of the "enemy country", that the struggle against capitalism in general
does not require absolute revolutionary defeatism because all the fractions
of capital are equal (9). It is precisely in those moments where any immediate
struggle against exploitation reveals its character of sabotage of the
national effort and where revolutionary struggle becomes indispensable
to obtain daily bread that the positions proper to centrism (positions
which resemble a classic position of bourgeois neutrality supplemented
by a collection of resounding declarations against war and for revolution)
can take their place as the ultimate bulwark against revolution.
<p>In every war the rate of exploitation of the proletariat increases in
a direct way and its conditions of existence are degraded by the fact of
destruction, from the lack of provisions and because, moreover, of what
every war implies, the unleashing of state terrorism with the aim of persuading
proletarians to kill and be killed at the front.
<p>That is why struggling against "one's own" bourgeoisie, fighting for
the defeat of "one's own" national (imperialist) camp are not positions
invented or introduced into the movement by revolutionaries. They are the
result of the <i>very development of the struggle against exploitation</i>
which through war undergoes a qualitative leap. The separation between
economics and politics by which they try to bamboozle proletarians and
which <i>seems</i> to have a certain reality in times of peace is practically
<i>liquidated</i>
during war. The illusion of defending the economic conditions of the proletariat
without being involved in politics crumbles. Every action of the proletariat
to defend its vital interests opposes it to the policies of "its own" state.
In times of war the "economic" struggle of the proletariat is directly
a
<i>defeatist struggle</i>. It is directly <i>a revolutionary struggle</i>.
<i>Revolutionary
defeatism</i> is a question of life or death for the proletariat. Any action
based on proletarian interests leads to the defeat of "its own" state and,
as Lenin said to the centrists, any really revolutionary agitation is a
contribution to the defeat of "one's own camp".
<p>That is why, when they tell us to abandon the struggle against exploitation,
or that now is not the moment or that the main enemy is elsewhere ("dictatorship"
or "fascism",... (10)), every time they are in fact acting to purely and
simply liquidate the struggle of the proletariat. Even worse, if in periods
of war the proletariat cannot defend its most elementary conditions of
life without struggling against "its own" bourgeoisie, without acting overtly
for the <i>defeat</i> of "its own" government, it renounces not only its
most elementary material interests but its existence as a class.
<p>This is to say that if the position of revolutionaries in the face of
war finds itself in complete harmony with their general positions this
is because these positions come out of the interests of the proletariat
themselves, from their immediate and historic interests which are inseparable.
In no way and under no circumstances does the proletariat have an interest
in sacrificing itself, whether in the name of the war against an external
enemy or under the false pretext that the enemies are all equal, the slogan
"neither victory nor defeat". Each time it is asked to put to one side
its conditions of life, each time it is asked to sacrifice itself in the
name of the struggle against fascism, imperialism, the external enemy...
this is a betrayal of its interests.
<p>To finish off, let's respond to an objection which has always arisen
in the face of the defeatist position of revolutionaries. It is obvious
that the counter-revolution will assimilate national defeat into the national
victory of the opposing camp. Elsewhere the centrists launch slogans such
as "neither victory nor defeat" on the basis of this argument. It is clear,
however, that this position is situated exclusively in the <i>national
(and not class) framework</i> and that it is a question of a conception
which sees in war only national victories or defeats and not the revolutionary
liquidation of the army, proletarian insurrection etc. However much this
position claims to be on the left or extreme left it does not hold back
in the least from the militarist and imperialist argument <i>par excellence</i>,
the argument of the generals who run the war. For them it is logical that
the revolutionary proletariat should be a "traitor to the nation" and "favour
the country's enemy". In reality, the more the defeat of the national army
accelerates, the more uprisings of troops and insurrectional mutinies break
out, the more fraternisation spreads on the front, the more the opposing
national army will also be weakened and we can verify historically how
the officers of "our own" army join forces with those of the other camp
to struggle against the proletarian movement. These agreements between
enemy officers are completely normal in view of the fact that the insurrectional
decomposition of the state always goes beyond a strictly national framework.
This is because while the proletariat is really <i>in the process of attacking
"its own" bourgeoisie, "its own" army, "its own" state, it is the whole
of the bourgeoisie which it is attacking, all the bourgeois armies, the
whole of the world state - in brief, world capital in its totality</i>.
Faced with the process of generalised defeatism, we can see that throughout
the history of capitalism the world bourgeoisie tries to unify itself,
to obtain agreements against desertion in both camps, to attack the bastions
of insurrection in their entirety. It is then inevitable that class confrontation
is given the highest priority.
<p>To recap what we have argued above, <i>revolutionary defeatism is the
best way of transforming imperialist war into revolutionary civil war,
war between nations or capitalist fractions into social revolution</i>.
<p>Furthermore, the more the defeat and disorganisation of "our own" state
becomes a reality, the less the state is capable of repressing revolutionary
action and the easier it is to communicate and to centralise the revolutionary
action developed by the proletariat in the other camp. The struggle "against
our own bourgeoisie" and against "our own" state thus takes on a supreme
level when, on both sides of the front, agitation and direct action leads
to the disorganisation and revolutionary defeat of all the armies, strengthening
the revolutionary action of the proletariat.
<p>Of course, revolutionary defeatism is often much stronger in one camp
than the other. In general this results from the fact that the politico-military
weakening of the army is more important in one camp than in the other and/or
from the fact of revolutionary action itself, from the organisation of
the soldiers, from the most determined character of the avant-garde sectors
of the proletariat. From the point of view of the bourgeoisie, all this
will be used to confirm that proletarians favour the opposed national camp.
But the strength of revolutionary defeatism in one camp allows the development
and reinforcement of revolutionary defeatism in the opposed camp in a still
more determined fashion. The means which have got results in "our" camp
will also be applied there. So, action coordinated with the internationalists
who find themselves in the other camp allows a far more effective defeatist
propaganda, appeals to desertion "in the other camp" will have much more
force and will be better understood by the soldiers themselves.
<p>We must not forget that the transformation of imperialist war into revolutionary
social war is possible thanks to the generalisation of revolutionary defeatism,
which in turn requires agitation and direct action in all camps. This agitation
and this direct action must be put to good use by the avant-garde sectors
of the proletariat who coordinate action across the front lines that the
international bourgeoisie try to impose. It will be precisely in the camp
where revolutionary defeatism is the most general and the most profound
that avant-garde minorities will be most able to develop revolutionary
defeatism in the "opposing camp". Consequently, there, where revolutionary
defeatism is most weak, where repression is exercised without restraint,
the most important international support will come from comrades who, in
the "other camp", are succeeding in imposing <i>revolutionary defeatism</i>.
As we have said already, the most precious aid from comrades in the "other
camp" comes from the revolutionary defeat of "their" army. The more that
army falls apart, the more comrades will increase their capacity to appeal
for fraternisation on all fronts, for desertion, for the organisation of
the struggle for <i>the generalisation of defeatism in all the bourgeois
armies</i>.
<p><i>In its essence, revolutionary defeatism is general and never national</i>.
It may well express itself at different levels in different countries or
bourgeois camps, but while it concretises itself in one country or one
camp it inevitably tends to generalise to the others. This historic determination
is taken in hand and lead by the avant-garde of the proletariat who try
to concentrate their defeatist efforts (propaganda, action, sabotage...)
precisely in the places and "camps" of the imperialist war where defeatism
has the least force to show the proletariat of "that camp" that with revolutionary
defeatism it has nothing to lose and a world to win.
<p>In all the great revolutionary experiences we can see the inevitable
phenomenon of the generalisation of revolutionary defeatism (11). Contrary
to all the defencist or neutralist arguments of the centrists, far from
being more controllable or invadable, a country in which revolutionary
defeatism imposes itself carries an enormous risk for the bourgeoisie of
the opposing camp if they want to continue the inter-bourgeois war. From
the Paris Commune to the proletarian revolution in Russia in 1917, we can
see that when facing an insurrectional movement of the proletariat "the
opposed national army" finds itself paralysed in the face of an important
tendency to fraternisation and thus to movements of troops against "their
own" bourgeoisie. When in 1918/19 the German bourgeoisie decided to ignore
this principle and continue the imperialist war against insurgent Russia,
they quickly became aware that revolutionary defeatism was taking on a
previously unsuspected force in Germany thanks to the "contagion" and the
revolutionary defeatist action of communists in both camps. The result
was that proletarian insurrection spread in Germany as well. The old allies
of Russia also immediately declared war on revolutionary Russia under the
pretext that "they don't respect the previous diplomatic and military agreements"
and a dozen armies then attempted to liquidate the insurrectional movement
in Russia. But here as well
<i>revolutionary defeatism generalised itself</i>
to all the armies. The organisation of workers and soldiers, the fraternisations,
execution of officers, occupation of ships by rebellious sailors and of
barracks by troops in the French armed forces, as well as those of Belgium
and Britain. Revolutionary defeatism was general in all the countries which
participated in the war, in the manner of the wave of world-wide proletarian
insurrection in 1919. The cleverest bourgeois then understood that it is
not possible to fight insurrection and revolutionary defeatism by sending
more soldiers and more armies because they will decompose ever more rapidly
and violently when faced with an insurgent proletariat. Winston Churchill
expressed that truth when he said that trying to crush an insurrection
with an army is like trying to stop a flood with a broom.
<p>Revolutionary defeatism can never be conceived of as a question of countries
or of nations, but as <i>a general opposition of the proletariat to capital</i>.
So far we have spoken, without an further clarification, of "our own" bourgeoisie,
"our own" state and so on. But, as all our readers know, our group has
never ceased to insist, since it started, that the state is <i>worldwide</i>,
that capital is <i>worldwide</i>. From the revolutionary defeatist point
of view, while we act against "our own" bourgeoisie" and "our own" state,
this has nothing to do with the nationality of the bourgeois or the government
which we face, as our enemies try to make people believe as they deform
the invariant content of our positions. We can never repeat enough that
the proletariat must struggle against all bourgeois, against all governments.
It is a matter of insisting on struggle against the <i>immediate</i> bosses
and <i>immediate</i> forces of repression, but as part of the world-wide
struggle of the proletariat against the world bourgeoisie. <i>The struggle
of the proletariat cannot rest on any intermediary</i>, and that is precisely
why the struggle against capital is always a struggle against direct exploitation
and state repression. The struggle against direct repression and exploitation
attacks the very bases of worldwide capital accumulation and the world
state. To put it another way, the central characteristic of the struggle
of the proletariat is <i>the organic centrality</i> of its direct action
against capital, by which (contrary to the struggle of capital) even if
that struggle takes place in a single neighbourhood, a single industrial
district, a single town, it contains the totality and represents, independently
of the consciousness of its protagonists, the organic general interests
of the proletariat worldwide.
<p>For the bourgeoisie and the proletariat, the central determinations
of struggle are exactly opposed. However much it may pretend to have a
general validity, the struggle of a bourgeois fraction always contains
an <i>egoistic and particular interest</i> because any movement of valorisation
attacks other processes of valorisation which must necessarily have interests
opposed to it (12). That is why the notion of unity defended by a fraction
of the bourgeoisie is fundamentally a democratic unity, an unstable alliance,
the result of the unification of opposed interests which ceaselessly fractures.
Whatever is the level of bourgeois unification it is always a question
of a temporary union against other, rival, fractions. By contrast, the
proletariat, even when it struggles around something particular, affirms
<i>its
organic being as a totality facing capital in its entirety</i>.
<p>That is why, when we speak of "our own" state and "our own" bourgeoisie,
we <i>don't</i> mean the bourgeoisie and the state of this nation (13),
but simply the bourgeoisie which exploits us directly, those who repress
us every day, the priests and/or trade unions that we have to confront
every day and which try to lead us to the abattoir of war. In a word, we
mean the tentacle of the world state which grips us and that we must slice
through to improve the general balance of forces in relation to the international
capitalist monster.
<p>If at some given moment, so as to re-establish capitalist order, other
bosses are put in place of the ones which we confront every day, or if
the national government solicits external help to repress us, <i>revolutionary
defeatism continues to be applied against the new bosses and the new immediate
repressive forces, independent of their nationality</i>, for the same reasons
and in the same way that we fought the old bosses and the old government.
That position is fundamental in the context of the bourgeois and imperialist
polemic about national liberation. Time and time again they try to turn
the struggle against the local bourgeois towards the struggle against the
"imperial" (14) bourgeois and time and time again they try to impose the
struggle between national fractions against the struggle between classes.
The most complicated situation arises when the local bourgeoisie, totally
overwhelmed by "their own" proletariat and having bourgeois sectors taking
up the discourse of "anti-imperialism" for an opposition, call for help
from the "imperialist" fraction to repress the insurgent proletariat, or
where the bourgeois fraction which calls itself "anti-imperialist" imposes
itself militarily on the others. In these cases, they try to squeeze the
proletariat between two imperialist forces, thus attempting to transform
its social struggle into imperialist war. But even in that situation we
are not faced with a new phenomenon. It is a matter of a classic imperialist
war against the proletariat, hidden, like every imperialist war, behind
national flags (15). It's obvious that faced with this situation the position
of revolutionaries doesn't change one bit, quite the contrary!
<i>Revolutionary
defeatism</i> shows all its relevance and continues to be applied both
to the "national liberators" who claim to be anti-imperialist as well as
to the military force of the "imperialist power" which tries to re-establish
order.
<p><i>In all situations</i>, therefore, the revolutionary struggle for
the transformation of the imperialist war into social war against "our
own" bourgeoisie makes itself concrete by <i>revolutionary defeatism</i>,
or to put it another way, by the struggle against the enemy which is <i>"in
our own country"</i>, against those who directly run, on behalf of world
capital, "our" exploitation and "our" repression. The strength of the proletariat
against capital depends precisely on its capacity to adapt itself to the
struggle against the various bourgeois fractions, against the different
forms of domination which capital tries to impose on us.
<p><i>Against every bourgeois war, revolutionaries have given, still give
and will always give the same response of revolutionary defeatism.</i>

<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">Notes</font></u></h3>
1. The fact that in 1914 official European social democracy placed itself
on the side of national war is nothing other than the confirmation of its
counter-revolutionary nature which had already been denounced for a long
time by revolutionary militants. German social democracy in particular
had already supported the imperialist military action of "its own" state
elsewhere. But the fact that in 1914 the imperialist and bourgeois characters
of the socialist parties was definitively unmasked contributed to the myth
(maintained by innumerable groups and centrist parties) of a social democracy
which suddenly lost its character as an organisation of the proletariat.
<p>2. Here we are only setting out our positions, without argument or explanation.
Those who would like to know our explanation of the fact that every war
of national liberation is an imperialist war, or that peace is a part of
war, those who want to know why we refuse any support to a democratic camp
against a dictatorial or fascist camp, we would direct to preceding issues
of our central review. To understand the relevant material and how it is
set out in various issues, we advise you to consult our <i>Summaries</i>
in French and Spanish, that we will send out on demand.
<p>3. In this "etc." we can also include the bombing of entire regions
where deserters gather (see our various articles on the class struggle
in Iraq), or the destruction of towns and villages which don't support
the war.
<p>4. It is always more correct programmatically to speak of the (world)
proletariat <i>"in"</i> such or such a country but, within the limits of
the dominant language, this often makes the formulation too cumbersome:
independently of the formulation that we are forced to employ, it should
therefore be clear that we are always referring to the world proletariat
<i>"in"</i>
such and such a region or country.
<p>5. In the end it is an idealist position identical to that put forward
by those who maintain that you shouldn't struggle for immediate demands
because that would be reformist, but you should struggle for revolution.
As if the reformist can satisfy the immediate interests of proletarians!
As if the struggle for social revolution can emerge by other means than
by the generalisation of all the immediate demands! As if the revolution
itself is something other than a need, an always more immediate necessity
for the proletariat in its entirety!
<p>6. The famous vote for war credits by the social democrats (despite
all the fuss that is made about it) is nothing other than the symbolic
part of their global practice aiming at crushing the proletariat and leading
it to slaughter. The mystification consists in believing that this vote
was decisive in the unleashing of the war when in fact it was nothing other
than the parliamentary formalisation of a much more general action which
had been going on for a long time. This was the domestication of proletarians
to the extent that they accepted to kill and be killed for the interests
of the bourgeoisie. That said, because the social democrats themselves
have always mystified that vote, it is interesting to quote them as they
claim to justify it.
<p>7. Lenin in "On the defeat of one's own government in the imperialist
war", Sotsial-Demokrat, number 43 (26 July 1915).
<p>8. Our group has always condemned the social democratic separation between
economic struggle and political struggle, between the immediate struggle
and the historic struggle. This is a separation which always ends up by
establishing intermediate or bridging programmes. This obviously has a
general validity but it is precisely in times of war, because of the efforts
and general mobilisation involved, that our statement becomes socially
evident and directly relevant. In effect, in these moments, every economic
struggle of the proletariat attacks the national war effort, every immediate
struggle against exploitation takes on a character of war against the state.
The struggle of the proletariat is then immediately a revolutionary struggle.
<p>9. It is obvious that all the fractions of capital are equally enemies
of the proletariat. But the problem in this context is that this argument
serves to paralyse the only struggle possible: the concrete struggle against
the bourgeoisie and the state which exploits, dominates and imposes the
national war effort. What's more, it is, for the proletariat, the only
way to develop its own power and to struggle at the same time against the
bourgeoisie of the opposing camp and against capital in general, which
concretise itself, as we will see later on, in the revolutionary defeat
of "its army" and the generalisation of insurrection.
<p>10. Creating fear by brandishing the spectre of fascism is a constant
of the counter-revolution which has cost humanity hundreds of millions
of dead since the 1920s (it's enough to think of the 60 million dead in
the so-called Second World War). We should also recall that in Spain it
was in this way that in 1936/7 the (Republican) state managed to disarm
and liquidate the proletariat that was the last rampart against war. But
war was indispensable to world capital and it finally succeeded in waging
it.
<p>11. And vice versa. When revolutionary defeatism does not impose itself
at all and the proletariat submits to the nation, to the popular front,
to fascism and to anti-fascism, as was the case during the "Second World
War", imperialist nationalism develops on all fronts and camps and the
generalisation of massacre is total. In that particular case the war destroyed
everything that capital needed to destroy to be able to begin a new cycle
of expansion based on mounds of corpses of "workers" who died clutching
their national flags.
<p>12. The state of the Yankee imperialists is not the first in the history
of bourgeois social formation to claim to incarnate the general interests
of world capital! From the origins of capitalism, various powers and bourgeois
alliances (whether it's the Vatican, the India Companies or the maritime
power of the British Empire) have tried to create a single solid order.
But this unity always cracks, bringing to nothing all the theories of Global
Monopoly and Ultra-Imperialism ardently defended, yesterday just as today,
in the bourgeois camp in general and by the social democrats in particular.
<p>13. What's more, as can be seen in some of our other texts, the nation
does not coincide in any way with the structuration of the bourgeoisie
into a state.
<p>14. We mustn't forget that the local bourgeoisie are equally imperialist.
<p>15. We want to take the opportunity to make it clear that, contrary
to all the myths about "national liberation", this type of capitalist war
is not something characteristic of "colonised", "poor" or "under-developed"
countries as the bourgeois "left" say. That type of war is proper to the
whole world, including in old Europe where there were and still are and
will be "national wars" as long as capital lasts. This type of war does
not belong to capital's past or to one of its phases, but results from
the development of capital itself and will continue to exist while that
social system exists.

<h1>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Down with capitalist war! Down with capitalist
peace!</font></h1>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The war is already in our neighbour's. The Hungarian
and the Yugoslavian government, the NATO and the UCK, Clinton and the Pope...
they all try to convince us that this war - just like all other wars -
is the consequence of some fatal mistakes, of some surprising abnormality,
of a slight hitch in the smooth running of the democratic world system,
and it is the brainchild of certain mad leaders. They all claim to be fighting
for peace...</font>
<p><b><font face="Comic Sans MS">They talk to us of peace - and they drive
us into war!</font></b>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">But war is not a fatal mistake. Just on the
contrary. It's the essence of capitalism, and one of the bases of its functioning
is the permanent economic fight among the different fractions of capital.
Capital is inherently imperialist. Conquering and obtaining more and more
markets belong to its normal way of functioning. The multiplication of
centres of war is a necessarily phenomenon. And it is always the proletarians
who get the worse in the fight between the different fractions of capital.
War is taking place in our everyday life too: when we are forced to work,
when the maintenance of our mere life is getting more and more difficult...
But sometimes capitalist "peace" is replaced by open war.</font>
<p><b><font face="Comic Sans MS">War is always against the interests of
the proletariat!</font></b>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">What does war mean on the level of everyday
reality?</font>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">- death on the front line and in the trenches...</font>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">- death in the prison camps</font>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">- death in the refugee camps, by the side
of roads, next to mass graves...</font>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">- death at home, under the ruins of houses...</font>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">- conscriptions, mobilization... in order
to force us to massacre each other, to kill our proletarian brothers in
the interest of capital...</font>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">- compulsion of work, militarization of
work and the increasing of its intensity...</font>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">- hunger, misery, high prices, shortages...</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">This reality shows evidently that the war
is against the proletariat, against our interests and against our struggle.
This war is a new episode in the already endless list of attacks by the
worldwide capitalist State against the proletariat. This nth war is nothing
but a genuine product of the capitalist world of exploitation.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">This war in Yugoslavia is another step towards
the more generalised war through the "acceptance" (an "acceptance" that
is being imposed by terror and permanent blackmail!) by all of war as the
"natural" perspective for society in crisis. The majority of proletarians
passively watch the progression of massacres on their television screens.
Since the crisis is "natural", so unemployment, misery, all kinds of sacrifices
also become "natural". You no longer protest, you start to accept to sacrifice
yourself. <b>And with this same logic, you will soon find yourself on the
train leaving for the front!</b></font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">This is not surprising since the majority
of proletarians today, especially in Europe, remain prisoners of patriotism
and other bourgeois ideological frameworks such as "pacifism", "anti-imperialism"
or still "anti-fascism" (all of which defend democracy, the social order
of capitalism ). This is not surprising either when we can see that the
international proletariat today is not capable of affirming its revolutionary
nature with its own communist project.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">As long as we remain passive consumers and
spectators of our own miserable lives, as long as we remain "useful idiots",
everything can happen to us. We shouldn't be surprised then if tomorrow
these good citizens start to kill each other for any reason you care to
name! Neighbour against neighbour, workmate against workmate, proletarian
against proletarian.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">The fact, that war is becoming "normal",
and the constant threat terrorizes, threatens not only the proletariat
of the states that are directly involved in the war, but also the proletariat
of the whole world. And capitalism - while it is launching wars - is talking
of peace and humanitarianism. But humanitarian campaigns, aid actions,
etc are only means of blackmailing - and, in passing, make market for tons
of unsaleable products - by which the control over the proletariat is being
strengthened.</font>
<center>
<h2>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">oOo</font></h2></center>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Today Yugoslavia is the most important centre
of war in Europe. There are several reasons for launching the war there,
but one of the most important is that since the middle of the '80s the
proletarians in Yugoslavia opposed a fierce resistance to the austerity
measures of the state. Compared with the beginning of the '90s, the war
has become considerably larger in scale. The NATO has intervened, Hungary
has become a war country; the international capital has attacked the proletarians
of the region. One of the direct reasons for this is the proletarian insurrection
in Albania, which started in 1997. The bourgeoisie hasn't managed to restore
order in Albania since then. Today the bourgeoisie tries to minimise the
treat of revolution: they drive the proletarians into an imperialist war,
setting them nationalist aims. In the fight "Serbs" are incited against
"Albanians" in order to hide that <b>the real fronts are</b> not between
nations, but <b>between the two classes, the bourgeoisie and the proletariat!</b></font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">The UCK (the Kosovo Liberation Army) is also
part of the bourgeois state, just like all confronting fractions. It is
proved by their nationalism, their army conscripted by force, which terrorises
the population exactly the same way as the Serb police does, their concentration
camps (they call them refugee camps), in which the terror guys of the UCK
collect everyone still fit for military service and send them to the front
line, to die.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><b>We, communists are against all sides</b>,
against the Serbs and the Albanians, against the NATO and the whole "international
community", against all states, against every bourgeois fraction.
<b>We
have no homeland! To be a patriot is to be a murderer!</b></font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Hungary has become a front-line country.</font>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">We can expect:</font>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">- the escalation of the war - since the
mobilisation of reservists, the preparation of the civil defence guard,
etc. have already started</font>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">- stabilisation of war conditions</font>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">- increasing nationalist incites, spreading
of irredentism (today Vojvodina, tomorrow Transylvania, Slovakia, Carpathian-Ukraine...)</font>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">- price rises, austerity measures because
of the war</font>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">- increasing surveillance over the proletariat,
intensification of the official (police, security guards) and unofficial
(fascist gangs) state terror.</font>
<p><b><font face="Comic Sans MS">FIGHT AGAINST WAR = FIGHT AGAINST CAPITALISM!!!</font></b>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">We're not powerless: we are rich in the historical
experience of our class, we must reappropriate the collective memory of
our struggles; this provides us with the classist framework for our own
activities and saves us having to reproduce the same mistakes again and
again. We also know that our struggle carries real perspectives, from life
itself. Looking ahead, we want to destroy non-life, our misery, exploitation!</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">In this fight we can only count on our own
strength, on the power of the proletariat. We, first of all, attack the
bourgeois fraction which we are directly confronted with, we fight against
"our own bourgeoisie". Internationalism doesn't mean to "do something for
proletarians everywhere"; but it means to be the part of the same struggle,
to assert here as everywhere the community of interests and of struggle
that we share with our class brothers and sisters in Serbia, in Kosovo
and everywhere in the world. Revolutionary defeatism = the struggle for
the defeat of "one's own bourgeoisie" - against the whole bourgeois order!</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">The small number of people today who appear
to oppose America's present bloody military interventions must be aplodded
for their courage and persistance.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">They stand against the masses' constant,
unthinking aproval of military force. And they are faced with situation
where they have no ideas to give them any expectations that they could
effectively oppose these interventions.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">The ideas put at the recent anti-war demos
seem approximately divided between pacifism and reformulations of the classical
Trotskist or Maoist left. Each of these approaches have some insights into
the conditions of the current slaughter (we are writing at the point of
simultaneous bombing campaigns against Yugoslavia and Iraq). Passifists
realize that the actions of each side serves mainly to polarize the entire
situation. Leninist leftists realize that each side is motivated by market
forces and the need to preserve capitalism. Each position has totally ridiculous
qualities as well. Pacificist ideology implies that the government, the
powerful or "we," may somehow just wake-up to the "mistake" that were made
and change the course of the war. Each Leninists group looks for a particular
nation to push as "oppressed" and naturally ignores the obvious common
interest each national gangster has with the other. The different flavors
"socialist" absurdly talk about "imperialism" when capitalism conquered
the entire world and NATO's intervention surely serves to strength the
bloody nationalism of Yugoslavia/Serbia.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">What each side misses is that this war is
an inherent result of normal daily life. What is naively called peace -
work, shopping and television - is the health of the state and the war
machine. The housing development, the industrial park and the shopping
mall create and are created by the military industrial complex. Not only
does military production sustain the economy, but every dictatorial institution,
from McDonalds to Microsoft to the Department of Defense, reinforces every
other. The wars of today are quite correctly called "police actions." America's
army intervenes on world scale to keep the same bloody order that cops
protect on a local level. The goal of NATO is not to simply to dominate
Kosova but to control the direction of it's development - to assure that
exploitation and peace prevail. Just as in Somalia, the war in Kosova began
to impose a "humanitarian solution" to the problem of a dispossessed that
would not behave. And this humanitarian solution is the order of capitalism
itself. "Humanitarian" organizations around the world have shown themselve
to be in many ways as much pawns of world capitalist as NATO. While some
NGOs are simply fronts for west intelligence agencies, their fundamental
problem comes as they operate with the paradigm of putting the dispossessed
in a positon of dependence and training the dispossessed for order of development.
In this way, the "NGOs" serve as social workers ("soft cops") to NATOs
hard cops. The humanitarian peace that NATO, NGOs and the United Nations
seeks impose is specifically to keep proletarians in a position of dependence.
If the various nations or organizations disagree about methods, it merely
a question of fighting about who gets to carve up the pie. A full picture
of this process can be seen in UN "humanitarian" refugee camps set-up after
the uprising against Saddam Husain in Northern Iraq ("Kurdistan"). These
camps demanded proletarian surrender their weapons in exchange for food
- food which the UN had itself embargo agaainst Iraq. The camps were served
to defeat the rebellious proletarians who were fighting America's supposed
enemy, Saddam Hussein. Indeed, US forces in the Gulf War had already killed
50,000 Iraqi deserters while working hard to keep Saddam Huesain in power.
(It is quite possible that once the dust settles in Kosova we will find
that similar rebellions happened and were suppressed by both sides. But
naturally, the actual situation is difficult to determine). In any case,
the present order of war and peace is directly against the proletariat,
and our rebellions, our refusal to accept the dictatorship of money, of
work and bureaucracy.</font>

Concentration camps have always existed. Every time that capital feels
the need to get rid of some of the labour-force commodity, proletarians
are gathered into camps and forced to work. First this is to keep them
under control, to prevent them from organising themselves against unemployment
and growing poverty. Secondly, as is the case in Italy today with the huge
influx of
<i>"refugees"</i>, it is to avoid having thousands of proletarians
roaming about as they might upset the balance of the fragile social peace
still reigning in the country. Eventually, when war generalises and death
itself becomes <i>"normal"</i>, it is a matter of purely and simply liquidating
those now useless, dangerous and expensive masses. That is what happened
all across Europe only 60 years ago.
<p>Today we are feeling the first symptoms. All over Europe so-called illegal
immigrants, refugees, boat people, are locked up. Proposals have been put
forward for forced labour for the unemployed. In Southern Italy there has
been large scale imprisonment of proletarians and the same in France, albeit
on a smaller scale. However, violence is always the same: in Pescara the
Italian Navy sank a boat full of refugees from Albania, in Belgium the
cops killed Samira Adamu by suffocating her with a cushion because she
refused to be expelled.
<p>Today, mostly in the West, democracy (another name for capitalist exploitation)
has founded its justification on anti-fascism. It promotes the memory of
the atrocities perpetrated by fascism to better ensure that crimes committed
by the anti-fascist camp will be forgotten (1). This is, in fact, customary
for any <i>"victor"</i> in imperialist war. The victorious side only publicises
the barbarities committed by the defeated side.
<p>The information below is from the <i>Sunday Times</i> (9/9/1998) and
is another example of labour camps which were built before the so-called
Second World War and which could well have inspired the Nazis.
<p>Between 1929 and 1939, under the government of the very socialist Ramsay
MacDonald, 25 secret concentration camps were built in the most remote
areas of England and more than 200,000 unemployed men were sent to these
camps and put to work at hard labour. The men, who were interned in the
centres for three-month periods, worked for up to nine hours a day, forced
by gang marshalls to break stones, build roads and cut down trees (2).
The <i>Sunday Times</i> reports that, when they arrived at the camps, the
men were issued with hob-nailed boots and a pair of corduroy trousers before
being assigned to a wooden hut dormitory. The men who refused to go to
the camps were told their benefit would be stopped once and for all.
<p>It was Sir MacDonald, vanguard socialist in the service of capital,
who had this brilliant idea of submitting unemployed proletarians to 3
months of such hideous living conditions and slavery that they would never
refuse a job again, even the most vile.
<p>The end of the twenties and the thirties were years of worldwide crisis.
Governments obliged the excess labour force - the unemployed - to remain
mobilised by imposing forced labour on them, aiming to rid the cities of
the emerging agitation. The so-called Second World War, which sent hundreds
of thousands of proletarians to the front line, was the fulfilment of this
massive clean-up operation. However, for the ten years prior to the war
preparations were being made. Concentration camps in England provided very
cheap labour and considerably decreased unemployment figures. The proletariat
was placed under control and enroled into the labour camps by force before
being sent to the army.
<p>Although all the governmental reports <i>"disappeared"</i>, some of
the prisoners, who are more than 80 years old now, confirm that there were
concentration camps, camps of slavery and terror. <i>"The treatment the
inmates received was degrading and inhumane. When I look back I realise
that the way we were treated was not much different from the way the Nazis
treated people"</i> recalls Willie Eccles, who was sent for three months
to the camp at Glenbranter when he was 18.
<p><i>"They were like chain gangs without the chains. It was slave labour.
They used to stand over us and bawl and shout at us to work harder, but
we used to work hard anyway just to keep warm. None of us wanted to go
there but we were forced to."</i> adds Charles Ward, 85, who in 1932 was
also sent to a camp for three months.
<p>This policy was called the New Deal (Roosevelt went on to borrow this
term and to use it in the USA) and it has recently been put on the agenda
in Britain by the very socialist Tony Blair.
<p>Blair's New Deal says that all the unemployed under the age of 25 will
lose their employment benefit if they refuse offers of a job. That is to
say that, whatever the wage and the working conditions proposed, they have
to accept, without question or any demands.
<p>The rule, today as much as yesterday, is <i>"shut up and accept it"</i>
if we don't want to die of hunger.
<p>Today, as much as yesterday, the same capitalist causes produce the
same camps...
<p>Be it in Italy, Israel and maybe soon in England, the state's concern
is always the same: to force the proletariat by terror to submit silently
to the successive attacks of this system of misery and death.
<p>If they could throw us into the sea, we would have become fishfood a
long time ago. But they cannot (3). Therefore, we are imprisoned in concentration
camps, labour camps, refugee camps, detention centres,... They don't give
food, they make us docile and stupid in order for us to leave, a flower
in our gun, for the next generalised massacre.
<p>However, we proletarians today, devalorised, impoverished, sacrificed
on the alter of value, are not powerless. Throughout the world, in a sporadic
and non-centralised way, our class resists, rebels, deserts, sabotages,...
<p>We are rich with the historic experiences of our class. Let's reappropriate
the collective memory of our struggles of yesterday and centralise our
fights of today. Let's organise to put an end to this system that feeds
itself on our blood!
<p>It is only for capital that we are excess proletarians; for communism,
<i>"proletarian"</i>
goes with <i>"revolutionary"</i>!

Capital has asserted itself as the <i>worldwide mode of production</i>
since the XVth century. Since then, it has cemented every brick in every
mine, factory, office where it extracts surplus value from those who it
exploits. It oils its machines, air planes and computers... with the blood
of those from whom it extracts surplus value. Capital has developed through
poles, poles where wealth is concentrated coexisting with poles of poverty.
But it imposes its dictatorship everywhere, in the North as in the South,
in the East as in the West.
<p>The <i>worldwide essence</i> of the capitalist mode of production also
determines the <i>international</i> character of the proletariat as a universal
class, containing within itself the everyday reality of exploitation as
well as all the necessary conditions for a revolutionary movement against
exploitation. Everywhere, in ever worse and terrifying conditions, proletarians
are forced to sell their only property, their labour power, in order to
survive. Therefore, it is as a worldwide class that they are led to struggle
so as to oppose the rapacity of the bourgeoisie. Whether black, yellow
or white, wearing overalls, sarongs or turbans, they are confronted by
the social contradiction at every latitude.
<p>It's therefore not just in the United States or in France that class
struggle takes place. Strikes, riots, mutinies and expropriations have
arisen in Nigeria, Burma, Indonesia, Mexico, Algeria, Iraq... violating
the social peace the State is attempting to impose. It is obviously not
in the interests of the bourgeoisie to emphasize that the living conditions
of proletarians lead to violent opposition to the same social system
<i>everywhere</i>.
Therefore, everything possible is done to avoid proletarians in France
or America identifying with the reality of their class brothers in Africa
and Asia, and vice-versa. Far better to envelope Rwanda and Iraq in television's
chaotic images of poverty, catastrophes and savagery than to zoom in on
the social determinations at the origin of the conflicts taking place.
in this way the model of a world divided into rich countries and poor countries
is perpetuated while the existence of social classes is conveniently swept
under the carpet. Shifting the contradiction is another way in which the
dominant ideology denies the reality of class struggle (1).
<p>What happened in Bangladesh some years ago will enable us to illustrate
all of this.
<center>
<h2>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">oOo</font></h2></center>
Violent social storms have been sweeping through Bangladesh on a regular
basis for several years. Bangladesh is a piece of land barely a quarter
of the size of France, packed with a population of 120 million. Yet, worldwide,
the issue attracting the media's attention is... the floods! This dimension
of Bangladesh's reality is much more presentable and in tune with what
the viewer wants to see. In addition, floods or monsoons are a lot easier
to explain away as inevitable than are riots or strikes. For the bourgeoisie,
what would be the point in shaking the dominant image of a country made
of "too much water and too many poor people"?
<p>However, it is not possible to completely black out the existence of
class struggle and some information gets through. The following is a resume
of news clips from various newspapers in December 1994: <i>"On December
4th 1994 thousands of poorly-paid and poorly-equipped police officers,
auxiliary militiamen (Ansars) mutinied, taking over two barracks, 22 officers
hostage and managing to take control of the headquarters and training centre
in the capital, Dacca. After 4 days, by which time the mutiny had spread
to other provinces, repression began in earnest. The army's special forces
attacked the occupies barracks, using very significant measures: artillery
guns, rockets, helicopters, gas, armoured cars... with an official toll
of 4 deaths and 50 wounded."</i>
<p>The first ideological image is therefore shattered: there are more than
just disarmed, ragged, soaking-wet beggars in Bangladesh! A different technique
is now needed to explain events and, this time, the media choose to fall
back on the traditional explanation of struggle between <i>"official"</i>
and <i>"opposition"</i> parties.
<p>What have the merchants of disinformation put together to explain the
mutiny? The bourgeoisie presents the events as a further episode in the
war <i>"for power"</i> between two women: one the prime minister and president
of the Bangladesh National Party (BNP) and the other the leader of the
"opposition" Awami League. The good citizen can turn over and go back to
sleep, happy in the knowledge that these events are well-circumscribed
within the democratic world, where class struggle is absent. The journalists
performed their role to perfection. But what exactly is it that the dominant
class wants to hide from us? If even cops are caught up in the social contradiction
to the point of mutiny, the situation must be a lot more socially explosive
than the bourgeoisie dares to admit.
<p>Indeed, the mutiny in December 1994 in Bangladesh was just one episode
amongst many in a long history of class struggle.
<p>A social movement was paralysing the country at the very time that the
mutiny took place. The bourgeoisie has carefully separated these two moments
in order to create a different reality, ITS TRUTH, its information, to
eternalise its reality throughout the world. Even if the struggle failed
to centralise its demands, its leadership, we know that these two movements
are one and are a manifestation of the proletariat's struggle to assert
a single community of interests in opposition to the exploiters. In fact,
scratch the surface of the mountain of disinformation piled, for the reasons
mentioned above, on this region to realise that these events, which came
to a climax in 1994-95, are merely the result of a long process of struggle
beginning in the 1980's. The following is a brief outline.
<center>
<h2>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">oOo</font></h2></center>
The global recession of the 80's had its impact on Bangladesh too. There,
as everywhere else, austerity measures were imposed at an infernal rhythm
so as to set the profit machine back in motion. Wage cuts, price increases,
devaluation, massive lay-offs... were put down as consequences of <i>"natural
disasters"</i> (floods, hurricanes - see text at the end) and the Gulf
War in 1990-91 (2). All of these measures hugely intensified poverty in
the region. The unbearable conditions pushed our class brothers, with nothing
to lose, to increasingly violent struggle: wildcat strikes in 1989, a vast
movement of social upheaval from October to December 1990, culminating
in violent riots, notably in the capital, Dacca.
<p>The struggles reached such a level over this period that the State decided
to dispense with the services of General Ershad, who came to power by way
of a coup d'&eacute;tat in March 1982. Thus, the bourgeoisie shed one skin
at very little cost to itself and passed new constitutional reforms as
further camouflage. The Awami League and the Bangladesh National Patry
(BNP), as new and therefore more credible actors, intervened in the political
scene to maintain and reinforce exploitation. But the existence of the
parliamentary circus failed to resolve a thing. The BNP, now in power,
merely continued of the capitalist program and took further measures towards
the <i>"rationalisation of the economy"</i>. 30,000 <i>"surplus"</i> proletarians
laid off on the railways, in the jute industry, and at Biman, the airline.
Little information has reached us as to how our class reacted to those
measures, but it is impossible to completely hush up the violent conflicts
which regularly jammed the cogs of the capitalist machine between 1992
and 1996. Here are some examples.
<p>In January 1992 demonstrations by several thousand young workers were
brutally repressed in Dacca. Their demands were said to
<i>"seriously threaten
the balance of payments"</i>, according to the torturers entrusted with
their repression. In February 1993 capitalists, enraged by striking textile
workers, sent their guard-dogs in to quieten down the exploited workers
who were refusing to work. This action was fully supported by the world
bourgeoisie. There was no question of the World Bank giving an inch: austerity
measures, here and elsewhere, had to hit hard. Capitalism must extract
ever-increasing profits, make ever greater gains. Experts from the European
Union urged the government to go even further in its restructure and to
close down twelve unprofitable textile factories, resulting in the lay-off
of several thousand workers. But the workers wouldn't take this treatment
lying down and went out on strike. New polarisations emerged, such as divisions
between <i>"Hindu"</i> and
<i>"Muslim"</i> workers and the appearance of
a <i>"Mongolian"</i> nationalist guerilla group, diverting proletarians
from the direction of the struggle. The main trade unions played their
traditional safeguarding role and tried to recuperate the struggles. In
March 1993 the trade unions tried to put themselves at the head of the
movement by calling for a <i>"general strike"</i>. The work stoppage was
massively overtaken by workers who had already been struggling for several
weeks. The national economy was paralysed by blockages of most of the main
roads and railways and social unrest affected all sectors.
<p>In October 1993 four universities were temporarily closed, having been
described by the government as <i>"centres of conspiracy and terrorism"</i>.
So great was the BNP's loss of credibility that, barely two years after
coming to power, the ruling classes were already considering playing their
classical card of alternation between bourgeois parties. Another team began
to prepare for power. From November 1993 and throughout 1994, the Awami
League and other so-called opposition parties prepared for the fall of
the government by blaming the BNP for all the misery steeped on the proletarians
since the collapse of the military regime. In an attempt to gain credibility,
and to get the workers behind its banner, the Awami League started a boycott
of the already much discredited National Assembly and called for the population
to demand a further electoral merry-go-round.
<p>But none of this prevented social tensions continuing to rise throughout
1994 and by the 26th of April Dacca was completely blocked by strikes.
Day by day, there was growing opposition to the ever-more draconian austerity
measures, recently imposed by the World Bank. The bourgeoisie was becoming
increasingly concerned. <i>"What we need for 'good business'"</i> they
said, "is a rapid return to social peace". With this in mind, foreign investors
urged the government to be tougher on the strikers.
<i>"We're concerned
with essential problems like order, security, and governmental stability.
Otherwise how can we expect to attract any investors?"</i>
<p>Strikes and demonstrations followed one after the other in various sectors
in April, May and June 1994. In July the opposition tried to take control
of the social movement, calling for a day to <i>"defend democracy against
the rise of Islamic fundamentalism"</i>. But these attempts did not mix
well with the demands of proletarians struggling to better their living
conditions. The trade unions mounted their defences so as to back the Awami
League, organising peaceful work stoppages, shutting workers away at home
or in factories with their arms crossed in order to prevent any extension
of the conflict. They also negotiated with the government to make a few
deals, which they then presented as <i>"great victories for the workers"</i>.
As a reward for the trade unions' efforts the government dropped charges
against 10 union leaders, at the same time as 5 proletarian militants were
sentenced to life imprisonment for <i>"terrorist activities"</i>, ie. organising
demonstrations, strikes, picket lines and sabotages of production against
the austerity measures.
<p>However, the circus of union/government negotiations proved incapable
of calming things down. During these struggles, violent confrontations
took place between the hungry and the forces of bourgeois order, most notably
in the port of Chittagong, a vital economic centre for the area. All traffic
was systematically paralysed by the dockers and other strikers who joined
them. Not a single boat was loaded or unloaded. In September 1994 further
strikes and demonstrations took place in Dacca and in Chittagong.
<p>According to the small amount of information which filtered through
the bourgeoisie's blackout, class antagonisms rocking this area were intensified
by the barbarous conditions in which capitalist exploitation was organised.
One example among many: in September 1994, 200 workers - including children
under 14 - were locked out of a clothing factory following several weeks
on strike. The reason was simple: the workers had spontaneously ceased
all activity and gone on strike, organising <i>a resistance fund</i> in
order to put an end to the insults, blows, unpaid overtime, sexual harassment,
wages lost for sickness or for time spent on the toilet. The bosses retorted
by having 5 workers arrested for "terrorism", who were then locked up and
beaten by the factory's thugs. Their wives met the same fate when they
protested against this cruelty. In Bangladesh such brutality is the rule
in the process of exploitation. It is not therefore surprising that every
strike and demonstration immediately expresses itself through direct, physical
confrontation with the forces of Capital and refuses to be put within the
pacifist framework extolled by those who try to convince us that we will
only get satisfaction by remaining calm and reasonable.
<p>Social agitation spread to the countryside and in October 1994 proletarians
burned a large part of the jute harvest in protest against wage cuts. In
the same month, 2000 children protested in Dacca against the government's
decision to forbid them to work. It is often their meagre wages which permit
entire families to make ends meet and, despite what moralising democrats
say, it is not <i>"parents' wickedness"</i> that forces very young children
to sell themselves, to prostitute themselves in factories or on sidewalks
for a crust of bread. It is the poverty in which this society of death
immerses proletarians, including children, which pushes us to prostitution
- sexual or otherwise - at younger and youunger ages throughout this squalid
capitalist hell! Poverty, work, struggle - the circle closes.
<p>In November 1994, new conflicts erupted in the textile industry and
it was at this time that the class struggle reached an intensity not seen
since 1989. Mutinies wreaked havoc on the security forces. In December
1994, on a background of strikes, demonstrations and riots across the country,
entire barracks rose up and refused to obey the government. Corrupted by
the social contradictions, themselves affected by the struggles, the usual
repressive forces were no longer sufficient and the employers' white militia
were brought in to guarantee the dirty work that the cops could not - and
would not - guarantee any longer. The bourgeoisie was obliged to use elite
troops to crush mutineers and to attempt to restore order. The dead could
no longer be counted... but despite this the protest movement did not appear
to stop. Social tension did not ease in 1995 and, on the 22nd January,
thousands of textile workers went out on strike again. They made road and
railway blocks across the whole country and confronted the forces of repression
who fired on the rioters. Once again, the main seat of these social troubles
was the port of Chittagong. Further demonstrations ensued and a home-made
bomb was detonated as the prime minister's procession went past. By April,
a further round of strikes commenced, affecting all major industries, but
the transport sector in particular. The immediate demands were for wage
increases, as well payment of a <i>"high living costs"</i> premium. Confrontations
with the white militia resulted in several wounded. The poison of elections
was then injected once again into the veins of the proletariat in order
to divert it from its struggle.
<p>During a <i>"day of anti-governmental mobilisation"</i> called by the
opposition parties in Dacca in November 1995 the stewards were overwhelmed
and violent confrontations erupted. By the 30th December, Bangladesh was
completely paralysed, with no trains, buses, boats or air planes running
at all. Pickets blocked any goods from leaving all depots, stations, ports
and airports. The national economy, so dear to the worldwide bourgeoisie,
thus found itself in a sticky position, with nothing circulating, hence
no business. Proletarians apparently had the capitalists by the throat,
but we have very little information concerning their capacity to remove
themselves from the murderous government/opposition polarisation put in
place by the bourgeoisie. No details have filtered through on the real
capacity of proletarians to draw lessons from their past struggles to confront
ALL political parties, to oppose ALL syndicalist for what they really are:
the managers of Capital.
<p>1996 did not see any major changes in the social climate. The information
that has reached us does not suggest a lull, but on the contrary, further
confrontations erupted during strikes in January, requiring the army to
intervene before calm was restored. There was a continuous military presence,
the prisons full to bursting. Faced with such serious events, the bourgeoisie
sacked the acting prime minister and organised yet another electoral charade.
Military units marched on Dacca and the possibility of a military coup
came onto the horizon as another solution to the social struggles. The
June 1996 elections were peppered with further incidents resulting in 20
deaths and 300 wounded, but it is very difficult to distinguish partisan
struggles between various electoral fractions from the class struggle waged
by the proletariat. Finally, the soldiers returned to their barracks and
the Awami League was declared victorious. Although, this time, all of the
parties had backed the spectacle of the ballot box, we have information
that rate of abstention was very high, but, unfortunately, we do not know
the exact figure.
<center>
<h2>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">oOo</font></h2></center>
Despite the distorted pictures broadcast by the media, or even in the face
of their total silence, such information confirms, yet again, <i>the universal
existence of class contradictions</i>. When the proletariat struggles,
be it in Los Angeles, Dacca, Lagos (3) or Paris, it struggles against the
same attacks on our conditions of survival, which is why the bourgeoisie
reacts in the same way everywhere. The bourgeoisie takes advantage of our
weakness to swing social crisis in its favour. The following are examples
of how they do so:
<ul>
<li>
by organising democratic alternation, swapping a Clinton for a Bush, or
a right-wing for a left-wing party.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
by launching further <i>"adjustment plans"</i>, <i>"privatisation"</i>,
in short, by further attacks on our class which always aim to extract ever
more surplus labour, all in the name of <i>"modernising production methods"</i>
and increasing the competitiveness of its companies.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
by keeping so-called opposition parties and unions in reserve so that,
during the inevitable social struggles, they can try to quieten things
down by following the direction of the movement and steering it towards
negotiations. If these measures fail, then they will call further elections,
a new government, another 24-hour general <i>"strike"</i>.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
by encouraging competition amongst the proletariat, developing nationalism,
dividing proletarians and setting them against each other. In this way,
they try to stop all direct responses to the new austerity plans, developing
all kinds of new polarisations - inter-religious, inter-ethnic, even corporative
and regional.</li>
</ul>
Every time the proletariat asserts its own interests the bourgeoisie is
intent on diverting the struggle towards further, reformist objectives:
left against right, civil against military, Moslems against Hindus in Bangladesh.
<p>When the media do cover any aspects of the assertion of our class, they
do so by diverting and encasing them in little boxes of reform of the system,
totally masking the organic unity of our class interests. Our class, on
the other hand, is still too weak to take on the contradiction with its
own press, contacts, networks, communist groups,... It is still too easily
hoodwinked by the false images presented by the bourgeoisie.
<p>Today it is still difficult for many proletarians - despite the objective
community of interests which unite them - to identify with the struggles
of proletarians in other parts of the world. The media's silence, outlandish
information and distortion of the truth make a very effective smokescreen
over the class struggle in Bangladesh, when watched from Europe or America.
This is the case for the majority of social combats taking place in areas
where the media coverage of an event depends on how spectacular an angle
can be given to it: if it is not possible to reinforce the traditional
"folklore" concerning a particular place, such as the floods in Bangladesh,
overpopulation in China, the Indians in Chiapas, blacks in Los Angeles,
then the spectacle is determined exclusively by a sordid calculation of
the number of dead and the distance separating the information from those
to be informed.
<p>The multitudinous means of <i>daily disinformation</i> as regards the
class struggle and the <i>historic hushing-up</i> of the communist movement
are both examples of the terrorist assertion of a world in which exploitation
(i.e it's essence) is categorically and systematically denied by the dominant
ideology. The systematic organisation of disinformation is one of the pillars
of the capitalist state just as the union and the political frameworks
and repression.
<center>
<h2>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">oOo</font></h2></center>
<i>BANGLADESH... not just floods!</i> By this small contribution we want
to work towards breaking the wall of silence surrounding such struggles
and to show our class solidarity with our fellow proletarians struggling
for the same reasons, for the same needs, in Asia as in Europe, in America
as in the Pacific.
<p>What lessons can be learned from these struggles?
<p>To support our fellow proletarians "over there" also means to criticise
them. This community of criticism will reinforce the proletariat who will
then no longer find itself weak in the face of the same enemies and the
same traps they set for us. Thus we must point out the enormous weaknesses
of the movement in Bangladesh since 1989:
<ul>
<li>
although the proletariat managed to make the bourgeoisie submit quite promptly
and once again proved its remarkable capacity as a class, the exploiters,
even whilst shaken and sometimes overwhelmed, managed to reorganise themselves,
passing through the same austerity plans in different guises: military
dictatorship, the government of the BNP and, finally, the Awami League.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
even if the proletariat was often capable of struggling outside the opposition's
framework, it must be noted that it did not manage to organise <i>against</i>
the opposition, nor against all the organisms who have once again shown
that their social function is <i>not only</i> to prevent any movement from
erupting, but <i>also</i> to follow and frame any class movement so as
to better ensure its defeat.</li>
</ul>
These two characteristics mark the limit of this 7 year wave of struggle
in the region. The lack of organisation, centralisation and direction of
the movement was prolonged by the proletariat difficulty in learning the
lessons of past defeats, necessary to move forwards. Each time, the movements
were massive, violent, and generally took place outside the bourgeois framework.
But, each time, <i>the incapacity of the movement to give itself its own
direction led the defeated proletarians to the very structures which they
should have done away with at the start of the struggle</i>.

1. This ideological reality is not the prerogative of the multinationals
of bourgeois information. Smaller ideological enterprises such as trotskyists,
maoists, councilists and libertarians put forward exactly the same model.
A superb caricature of this can be seen in the publications of the ICC
(International "Communist" Current) in which all the racist posturings
of this vision can be found: <i>"central and peripheral countries"</i>,
<i>"Iraqi
Lumpenproletariat"</i>, <i>"desperate Mexican peasants"</i>... For a more
detailed account of this issue, see
<i>Communism</i> 10: "Social-democracy's
eternal euroracist pacifism".
<p>2. The deportation of 90,000 workers from Kuwait and Iraq increased
the misery of more than a million people. A single expatriate proletarian
had managed <i>"to support"</i> an average of twelve people by sending
back part of his income to his family.

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">The East India Company set itself up and
the English bourgeoisie traded at full pelt. It imposed its own trade rules
and very quickly began producing the same cloths in England that it had
initially imported. This resulted in a profound transformation - Bengal
was shifted from a position of manufacturer to that of supplier of raw
materials (cotton, jute). The consequences of this change were enormous
for agriculture, which went from a auto-consuming polyculture to an exporting
monoculture and meant that all land was then used for monoculture. From
then on, as elsewhere, crises in production of this raw material, now practically
the only crop, went on to lead to famines. The first of these famines was
in 1770. We want to stress that it was capitalist progress itself which
brought about the famines, not some local climactic or geographical conditions.
The situation only worsened when an even more speculative monoculture arrived
on the scene: opium. Destined for the Chinese market, English capitalists
sold opium throughout the 19th century up until 1939. In 1947 India was
divided in two: the Indian Federation on one side and Pakistan on the other,
Pakistan consisting of two territories separated by 1,500 kilometres. A
war broke out between West Pakistan and East Pakistan, the latter backed
by India. Bangladesh (former East Pakistan) was created in 1971 as an outcome
of the war.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">If there's no mention of floods before the
division of India it is simply because this area which suffers so much
today was not yet inhabited. And for good reason! This area, composed mostly
of the southernmost delta of the Ganges (mostly swamps and mangrove groves!)
remained virtually deserted until 1947.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">What was it that drove massive numbers of
proletarians into this area? Nothing but inter-imperialist interests.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Backed by England, the partition of India
(officially done on the grounds of preventing religious wars between the
Hindu majority and the Moslem minority ) ends up by placing the Hindus
into the Indian Federation (now modern India) and the Moslems into East
and West Pakistan. This division meant the forced movement of large numbers
of proletarians, something which today would be considered ethnic cleansing.
East Pakistan (future Bangladesh), is economically the least interesting
part of Bengal, the Moslems placed there because of, in part, the pressure
of the Hindu bourgeoisie who wanted the most prosperous area for itself.
This was fully supported by the English capitalists who were keen to maintain
trade relations with their Indian ex-colony.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">The artificial increase in Bangladesh's population
as a result of massive forced moves was soon followed by a demographic
explosion. This is why this tiny state, barely 5 times the size of Belgium,
has ended up with a population of 120 million people (12 times as many
as Belgium, twice as many as France) and a population density of 810 inhabitants
per square kilometre. In the areas most hit by floods there are easily
1000 inhabitants per square kilometre. (As a reminder, Belgium and Holland,
listed amongst the most populated countries, have a density of "only" 350
inhabitants per square kilometre.) All of these people have to go somewhere.
The only solution that international capitalism has found is to push these
people further into the swamps mentioned above. Hundreds of thousands of
proletarians drown as the waters rise and they are squeezed between strict
political borders and the sea. And all of this thanks to the progress of
capitalism which forced people to move to areas in which no one would have
considered living in previously. The hundreds of thousands drowned are
the price to pay for the continuation of Progress and the Bangladeshi Nation.</font></blockquote>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">* <font size=+4>*</font> *</font></h1></center>
We don't want to enter into the polemic provoked some years ago in the
Basque Country and in Spain as to whether or not the execution of Miguel
Angel Blanco by ETA and the campaign of the Spanish State marked an irreversible
qualitative jump in interbourgeois (imperialist) war; it is of far greater
interest to us to denounce <i>the repugnant spectacle of popular adherence
to the state's mobilization</i>.
<p>The issue is not at all whether ETA is more or less criminal; even at
a time when ETA was putting bombs in supermarkets and killing indiscriminately,
the Spanish state never managed to achieve a popular mobilization on the
scale achieved today in the face of ETA's execution of an individual directly
implicated in the governmental party and thus in its repressive action.
By carefully setting the seen using the increasing imbecilisation of public
opinion, the state has succeeded in getting the citizens to associate with
their master, amalgamating ETA's actions with what current dominant ideology
considers to be evil incarnate: the Nazis and the concentration camps.
Thus the extreme is reached of spectacularly comparing the situation of
some guy held prisoner by the ETA with the Nazi concentration camps! It
is hardly surprising that this comparison is never made when it is the
Spanish state that is jailing, torturing or killing! (1)
<p>The repugnant spectacle of radio and television campaigns for the
<i>"blue
ribbon"</i> (2) demonstrates <i>the State's capacity for democratic manipulation,
the capacity of its apparatus to put amalgam into practice, as well as
the importance of the broadcasting media in this policy of manipulation
and fabrication of public opinion according to bourgeois interests</i>.
<p>It is also worth pointing out here that all political sectors have collaborated
with this type of campaign (with the obvious exception of the accused:
ETA and Herri Batasuna, its political wing). Indeed, even traditional allies
of the ETA such as the other Basque nationalist groups or guerrilla groups
from various countries have contributed. The example of the Uruguayan Tupamaros,
in their current legalistic phase, is all the more meaningful since this
group was always very close to ETA's positions and ardently defended its
militants, involving itself, for example, in the struggle against their
extradition. It is characteristic of all of this campaign of amalgam that
the Tupamaros, who were never concerned by ETA's criminal activities when
they were carrying out indiscriminate bombings resulting in the deaths
of proletarians, yet now feel obliged to distance themselves from ETA when
it is to do with the elimination of Blanco, a bourgeois, a man of the state.
(According to certain statements made in the press it would seem that the
same can be said about "Shining Path" in Peru (3).)
<p>Here is an example of how Rafael Larreina, a member of the Basque parliament
and vice secretary-general of Eusko Alkartasuna, is moved and participates
in the televised myths:
<p><i>"... now that two months have passed since the murder of Miguel Angel
Blanco, we observe with a certain distance the consequences of this event
and the facts that occurred subsequently. The slow-motion crime of Ermua,
barely a few days after the striking picture of Ortega Lara emerging from
his terrifying captivity, triggered a reaction of horror and indignation
without precedent that we all, independently of our political adherence,
shared in this country. The popular reaction was equally obvious and strong
and should serve as an element of reflection for the leaders of Herri Batasuna
and the ETA so that they can determine whether or not they really are involved
in the process of national construction and whether they accept and take
note of the popular will and want the independence of Euskalherria."</i>
<p>Repugnance and hate are what we feel about this national unity of <i>"all,
no matter what their political persuasion"</i>, towards this unity for
national reconstruction, this unity which calls for more state, more democracy,
more peace... that is to say more control, more repression, more police.
<p>We know that the purpose of this campaign is the fortification of the
State, we know that its biggest success is precisely popular participation
in these demands for a more democratic State, for greater repression and
we know that this campaign "against terrorism of the ETA" aims fundamentally
to <i>fortify the bourgeois State</i>. We also know that this campaign
is fundamentally preventive against any possible action by the proletariat
which terrorizes the bourgeoisie (4). We know that this campaign hits the
international proletariat, especially the proletariat in Spain and even
more so the one that is in the Basque Country.
<p>Driven by our repugnance and our horror for all this campaign of state
control, driven by our desire to show our solidarity with the proletariat
directly attacked by this impressive wave of laments, of domestication,
of affirmation of democracy and terrorism of the State, we publish the
following translation of an excellent article entitled <i>"desprecio del
lazo azul"</i> ("our contempt for the blue ribbon") of which we don't know
the authors and that was published in 1997 (in Spanish) in the EKINTZA
ZUZENA magazine (5). The text goes way beyond the content announced in
its title and is signed: <i>"Writing found at the University of the Basque
Country."</i>
<p>We also want to express our solidarity with the comrades who, in these
difficult times for the proletariat in the Basque country, have the courage
to produce and to circulate texts like this, texts full of <i>contempt
for the blue ribbon</i>.
<h3>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">Notes</font></u></h3>
1. And here we are not only referring to the presidential and ministerial
implication in the GAL affair (Felipe Gonz&aacute;les, supporting the campaign
denounced here, mounted a defence of the GAL's torturing cops), but also,
in a more generic manner, to police repression and the situation of prisoners
in the jails of Spain or whatever other country.
<p>2. The <i>"blue ribbon"</i> is the rallying sign displayed by all those
who want to mark their adherence to the anti-terrorist campaign organized
by the Spanish State.
<p>3. Nevertheless, considering the manipulation carried out by the State
in Peru, it is difficult to know up to what point these declarations emanate
from the fighters of this organization or from a whole of collaborators
of the government designated with the name of "Shining Path", thus aiming
to spread confusion.
<p>4. Sectors of all kind are conscious of this qualitative step made by
the State in Spain carried in the legitimisation of terror thanks to popular
mobilization. So Jaime Pastor, in a report on the consequences of the execution
of Blanco carried out by HIKA, wrote: <i>"... a newly created script is
being approved in order to give a greater social legitimisation for a merely
police-based solution to the Basque conflict, which will, moreover, allow
this erosion of liberties and rights to be exercised against any kind of
activity of dissent against the prevailing political and social system.
Thus, even if the all the measures announced to reform the Penal Code are
not approved, the PP [Partido Popular] knows that it can count on favourable
public opinion towards its propositions, thus favourable to a greater recourse
to Orwellian techniques of surveillance and control of citizens' security."</i>

<h1>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">Our contempt for the blue ribbon</font></u></h1>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not for well-intentioned individual souls, but
for the idea of democratic peace itself.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">If we assert that the pacifism of the blue
ribbon in which they want to make us believe, is false, it is not because
we have no criticism of the armed violence of the ETA (or whichever other
organization), but because we think that this history of mobilization against
<i>"perpetrators
of violence"</i> is a manipulated phenomenon that only serves to distract
from the global and legal corruption upon which the game of capital depends:
the daily violence that the State and Capital exercise on populations,
dispensing a living death; the generalized prostitution or submission to
money to which we are condemned and, finally, to hinder the grassroots
politics seeking to rise up against the domination of money.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">You embrace the bourgeois democratic institutions,
proclaiming your faith in them and, in so doing, you accept their violence,
submission, deception. No power can maintain itself without its Ministry
of Lies to impose itself on populations, so that they accept the servants
of Capital and the state in good faith and also want to function as good
servants. The essential thing is that the majority - which soon converts
itself into all - does what it is asked to, but on the condition that each
one believes that he is doing it willingly, of his own volition. They obey
Pharaoh's slaves. It is the same thing! Our production of skyscrapers and
of means of transport which are not used for any of the things that they
say they are and our proliferation of sensless things without any real
utility, is, after all, the same as the construction of pyramids for eternity.
The same majority, the same blindness, but this time based on the decision,
the choice, the will of everyone.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Stand very close to any pavement to observe
the traffic jams that occur thanks to the personal car (democratic institution
par excellence) and you will see how, in fact, everybody (the majority)
goes more or less at the same time to the same place, but each on his own
account, in his own car and of his own volition. Remind yourselves that
this bone-shaker they sell us as a means of transportation (and that actually
entailed the death of useful transport like the tramway or the railway)
demands the regular and increasing weekend and holiday-time sacrifice of
thousands of lives, far more than all terrorism put together (quite apart
from its contribution to pollution, motorways, taxes, small wars over gasoline
over at the limits of development...). But of course, they make us believe
that we have chosen this, when in fact it has been imposed. No one asked
for the car, it was the domination of development which required the creation
of needs in order to maintain the illusion that money can satisfy such
needs (that were not needs before), to continue to make work (without need),
to entertain the masses, finally, to circulate capital and maintain the
institutions of the State. Then, the fact that thousands of people die,
can be camouflaged as carelessness, accidents or bad luck, in short, as
something natural that we must resign ourselves to accept.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Something else that they want to make us
believe, by way of endless electoral shows, is that the bourgeois institutions
represent the people. That is to say that the sum of individual opinions
on the faces and names offered to them is equivalent to the people. What
an enormous lie! Therefore, as the people is no more than its lowest common
denominator, the common man, there is no Christ who can represent it. (...).
The majority is the majority of our opinions (created and directed by the
media of mass education - family, school and, finally, morality) that can
be easily collected, counted and which produce a whole on which the power
establishes itself. But in no way we can confuse this with the latent force
of negation in those hearts which have not been completely submitted to
the faith - a faith in which everybody knows what he wants and where he
is going, a faith in the future, through which death is administered.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">And how do they do it? By preventing the
people from living, creating an empty present with the excuse of a better
future, an unlived present in exchange for a future, for death, because
the future is always unannounced death (waiting, empty time which is necessary
to fill with something: boredom). Look at the propaganda, especially at
the bank (the true churches of today). See how they are interested in the
child already having a savings plan, even a personal pension plan! Let
him start to sacrifice himself for his future right now! (or someone do
it for him, which amounts to the same thing).</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">See how the notion of travel has been transformed:
they lead us to believe that a journey consists of an empty stretch of
road enabling us to arrive at a place in a way that neither the destination
nor what happens during the journey is of any importance. An empty time
is created which has to be filled with something, of course (TV, music,...).
The ideal to be reached is for the emptiness to be no more than a bureaucratic
formality. This criteria can be applied to what they sell us as being life.
From childhood, we are set goals to make us believe in their lies to the
point that we assimilate them as if they were our own ideas. So death arrives
to us without us having realized what happened.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">The work that is done is really useless (seeing
that it doesn't obey real needs but the needs Capital). As for this free
time that one buys (leisure with work, peace with war, glory with sacrifice,
wealth with savings for some or with exploitation for others), it cannot
be a time naturally distinct from work-time, war-time or penitence-time.
This time is empty. Just as peace won by war is nothing else than undeclared
war, what one calls free time is actually undeclared work, calculated in
a very precise way in fractions of time (the real currency of money), 15
minutes of happiness (in a Thai sauna), two and a half days of happiness
(in the weekend escape), 1 month of happiness (to roast in the mediterranean
sun): but deep down one knows that a ration of happiness must have been
cut and determined by someone, calculated. And this is what is offered
to the heart as a lie and to our desire as an insult. It is a lie that
one can live a partly free life and a partly slave life; one is contained
in the other and <i>"The price changes the taste of the sweet"</i>.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">And so, here we stand before an attempt to
administer death, perfect domination, the reduction of the people to a
mere mass and which, in spite of all, is always hindered by the latent
refusal of the people to let itself be reduced to this whole and this idea.
It is the war of common sense against the fixed and dominant ideology.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">We could talk of the miseries that the empire
of development necessarily creates beyond its limits, miseries that are
largely put up with but that we must not forget are no more than the misery
of wealth which results in the majority living on substitutes: whether
one considers apartments to be houses, plastics to be textiles, choses
not to pay for a driver or a wagon, but to be the driver oneself and to
like it... There are lots of examples in your lives, you just have to look
and you'll find them.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Let it be clear that what is sold to us as
peace is nothing but war and that the so-called system of liberties is
nothing else than the same domination as always, improved and perfected.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">If this domination falls or at least stumbles,
it is precisely because it lacks what it needs the most: our faith.</font>

<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">Who are we?</font></u></h2>
Rather than being the fruit of the subjective efforts of a handful of militants,
a communist organisation is first and foremost the result of historical
determinations that irresistibly push the proletariat to constitute itself
as a class, to organise itself as a force, as party, distinct from, and
opposed to, all bourgeois parties. The organisational effort of proletarian
minorities, concretised in time and space by the creation of a communist
group, is fundamentally determined by <b>communism as a movement</b> and
by its
<b>historical party</b>, i.e. by the accumulated memory of the whole
of the experience of previous struggles, condensed into a programme. The
creation of our group did not escape these historical determinations.
<p>The Internationalist Communist Group (ICG) has existed since 1978.
<p>We publish central reviews in French, German, English, Arabic, Spanish,
Hungarian, Kurdish and Portuguese. We also have texts in Greek, Persian,
Russian, Serbo-Croat and Turkish.
<p>Our group has no national reality. It is not linked to any country and
does not refer to the history of any nation.
<p>Its starting point was the centralisation of a handful of militants
coming from different continents, speaking different languages, who, from
many different experiences of struggles and reflexions on the defeat of
these struggles, were willing to develop and centralise their common militant
activity worldwide together.
<p>With the common political content of our ruptures, we then chose to
formalise our discussions and polemics in a common organisational structure
and define ourselves as the "Internationalist Communist Group".
<p><u>"Internationalist"</u> - Well aware that this term is redundant when
used in association with the term "communist", we characterise ourselves
as "internationalists" first of all to stress that communism, from its
very origins and as the movement, excludes country, nation, national struggle.
It signifies that our group is directly organised on an international level.
We did not first constitute our group as a "national party" and then later
open ourselves up to the "international". We started directly with a central
organ, translated into different languages of course, which always deals
with the general interests of the movement, always stresses the homogeneity
of the conditions of exploitation of the proletariat throughout the world
and always puts forward what all these conditions have in common: the reality
of capital and therefore of the proletariat and the conditions for the
realisation of communism.
<p>On another level, the term "internationalist" also allows us to dissociate
ourselves from the many counter-revolutionary variants disguised as communists
(Stalinists, Trotskyists, Maoists, Bordigists,...) who, by more or less
shamefully supporting one or other so-called revolutionary nation, allow
dominant ideology to amalgamate communism with the red-painted capitalism
of the so-called "communist countries".
<p><u>"Communist"</u> - From time immemorial, all the bourgeois fractions
(Versaillais, fascists, republicans, Stalinists, liberals,...) have fiercely
attacked the spectre constantly haunting the capitalist world: communism.
However, revolutionaries (and our modest grouping no more than the others)
never let themselves be impressed by the flood of insults and the continuous
falsifications formulated throughout history against communism. Communism
- the human community, the collective beinng, the classless society - remains
the perspective for which we passionately fight. It is as communists that,
facing the capitalist catastrophe, the dictatorship of profit and money,
the constant degradation of our living conditions, we loudly and clearly
demand the abolition of this world of death, the abolition of private property,
of the state, of the exploitation of man by man. With our comrades throughout
history and all over the world, we once again affirm the necessity for
a classless society, without money, without work, where the free disposal
of time and things will constitute the only terrain for human activity
to blossom.
<p><u>"Group"</u> - By forming a group, we are once again expressing the
historical will of revolutionary proletarians to organise themselves as
a force, to centralise themselves as party. If we do not claim to be a
"party", it is because we know that true constitution into class (and therefore
party) does not depend upon any pompous self-proclamations, but upon a
material qualitative step in the social confrontation against Capital,
State, bourgeoisie. Therefore we consider ourselves to be a faction of
the communist movement; we struggle to exist as an international nucleus
of the centralisation of the proletariat and, as such, participate in the
efforts of vanguard minorities to centralise the community of struggle
that exists throughout the world.
<center>
<h2>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">oOo</font></h2></center>
It is thus as the Internationalist Communist Group that we have chosen
(for more than twenty years now) to carry on our international discussions.
To reappropriate history - the communist programme - we have naturally
centred our interest and discussions on the highest moment of rupture that
our class has produced up until now: the international revolutionary wave
of struggles of 1917-1923. The numerous texts published in our reviews
which try to draw, without any ideological a-priori, the lessons of the
revolution and counterrevolution in Russia, Germany, Hungary, America,...
during that period are testimony to this collective work and the passionate
debates it gave rise to.
<p>But beyond the centralisation of the international discussion on 1917-23,
our reviews also fight against all ideologies and take a stand on many
questions: the criticism of science, work, economy, philosophy, texts against
the State, reproduction of historical texts of our class ("our class memory"),
texts taking a stand on facts and current events, on historical polemics,...
<p>Of course, it is impossible to describe here the real life of our group,
the essence of the lessons we draw from history and even less so the content
of our positions. However our reviews, texts, leaflets,... describe quite
well how:
<ul>
<li>
communism, the classless society, does not mean the end of history but
the beginning of the conscious history of the human species.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
capitalism, by its universal essence and by the simplification of class
contradictions, creates the conditions for its own negation, the conditions
for communism as well as the social force that will impose it: the proletariat.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
the revolutionary dictatorship of our class will abolish the state and
will crush any attempts to restore value.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
democracy cannot be reduced to a form of capitalist domination but constitutes
the substance of bourgeois dictatorship.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
the communist movement opposes all bourgeois parties of the "right" or
of the "left", parliamentarianism, trade unionism and all the forces that
maintain social peace.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
the affirmation of communism is the negation of the whole of present society,
negation of private property, of money,... but also of work, school, family,
science,...</li>
</ul>
To give an overview of our contributions, we recently produced a general
summary of the articles published in our reviews in French and Spanish;
this brochure is available on request at our central addresses (post box
or e-mail).
<p>Besides the central reviews that we produce regularly, in 1989 we also
published in Spanish, French and Arabic our "Theses of programmatical Orientation",
the English version coming out in 1999. These Theses represent an attempt
to synthesise the international discussion and the communist criticism
that we have continued from our very origin. We did not want to elaborate
the nth version of some or other holy text, but to present a "snap-shot",
a moment, of the collective permanent work of programmatical restoration
that we have started. Enemies of all bibles, with this kind of document
we are only seeking an increasingly precise delimitation of the communist
practice of rupture from capitalist society. Our Theses try to express
the real movement of abolition of the established order; they are thus,
of course, imperfect and unfinished and will remain so until revolution
itself puts the pleasures of a life without money, class and State into
practice.
<center>
<h2>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">oOo</font></h2></center>
Sectarianism is one of the characteristics of periods of social peace and
groupings of militants themselves hardly escape the crazy logic of competition
of a society centred on division and on the war of all against all. Aware
of these difficulties and willing to fight against sectarianism, we try
(just as we do in our internal debates) to systematically put forward <u>our
convergence</u> in the framework of the international community of struggle.
<p>In this sense, we call on all those who continue to fight against a
world based on the exploitation of man by man to appropriate our texts
for themselves, to reproduce, circulate them and to consider our reviews
as theirs. The result of collective works, our texts are no one's property
in particular, they belong to a class that is living and fighting to abolish
its own condition as an exploited class, and hence all classes, all exploitation.
<p>Just like the revolutionaries who preceded us, we conceive our press
as an indispensable means of revolutionary propaganda, collective agitation,
programmatical development, action.
<p>We want our texts to be subjected to a militant reading, discussed,
criticised and used to confront other positions in order to clearly define
the terrain of revolution and counterrevolution and to support, always
more determinedly, the revolutionary direction imposed by our class in
its constitution as a class and a worldwide historical force.
