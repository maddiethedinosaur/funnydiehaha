<blockquote>Although this review has been printed after the NUM's decision
to call for a return to work, the article on the miners' strike was written
4 months earlier. Since the general outlines of the strike, which we've
analysed in this article, remain valid, and moreover, are confirmed by
the (provisional) outcome of the struggle, we've decided to publish this
text anyway without reactualising it. We'll complete it by drawing up,
in a separate leaflet, the balance-sheet of this strike, because the proletarian
struggle, in spite of this severe setback, goes on, be it through different
means. Undoubtedly, the consequences of this strike will be numerous for
the struggles to come. Not only negatively though: more precisely concerning
the bourgeois nature of the unions, especially of radical unions and on
the rank-and-file level, we'll do everything in our power so that this
most crucial lesson from the miners' strike will never be forgotten!</blockquote>

<h1>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">* <font size=+4>*</font> *</font></h1></center>
In all countries, the bourgeoisie continually steps up its attacks on the
working class. Everywhere, austerity plans have to be imposed: redundancies,
speed-ups, expulsions of immigrant workers, industrial rationalisations,
wage-cuts... it all mounts up to an intensification of misery, an increase
in exploitation and in the end... the destruction of proletarians on a
world-scale.
<p>In Brazil, hundreds of thousands of starved proletarians spread over
cities and started looting: they attacked shops, storehouses, trains,..
In Spain, steelworkers clashed violently with police. In Tunisia, in Morocco,
in Algeria, in Egypt, in Belgium, in Holland... the proletariat has been
refusing, for reasons which are fundamentally identical, the measures governments
have taken against them. All these struggles, even though they are limited
and contingent, are expressions of the proletariat's tendency to universally
organise itself against capital.
<p>The miners' strike that has been going on for many months now is part
of this world-wide proletarian attempt to refuse and oppose the impeccable
logic of the dominant system.
<p>We have to analyse this struggle as such, which means we have to put
all actions, all violence, all organisational attempts into their general
framework, i.e. the total comprehension of the communist perspective.
<p>In the first part of this article, we'll analyse the positive elements
of the miners' strike, its characteristics that constitute a step forward
considering today's balance of forces between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie.
But must of all, we want to analyse the general weaknesses of this strike.
In opposition to many groups who think their role is only to be able to
explain weaknesses (for this reason they analyse each particular struggle
"in itself" without linking it to the historical communist movement), which
finally comes down to accepting the status quo under pretext that weaknesses
can only be bypassed when all workers have become conscious of them, we
claim that our internationalist solidarity with all proletarian movements
must express itself through the pitiless criticism of their weaknesses.
It is only through this criticism (with all its practical implications)
that we can try not to be as powerless as before in front of always the
same enemies, of always the same deadlocks. So one of our specific tasks
must be to fight those weaknesses. More generally, to draw up the balance-sheet
of historical as well as of today's struggles, in order to transform it
into practical arms for tomorrow's struggles, is one of the fundamental
tasks of revolutionary militants. This way we can also see that weaknesses
are not specific to one or another struggle, be it on a national level,
but that they are determined by the world-wide and historical balance of
forces between the two classes. The weaknesses of each particular struggle
are a materialisation of the general state of non-preparation of our class;
if a particular struggle is not radical enough to bypass the general weaknesses,
it not only reproduces but also reinforces them!
<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">Massiveness and determination</font></u></h2>
Miners have been on strike for nine months now. Although it is clear that
the overall direction and control of the strike remains firmly in the hands
of the NUM. In spite of NUM propaganda on the sense of responsibility of
strikers, of their care for the health of British national industry, those
tens of thousands of workers show, through their daily practice - be it
for a majority of them in a passive way - that they don't give a shit about
neither Britain nor its economy. Their failure to make common cause with
capitalist interests remains mainly passive - they don't oppose union militancy
for national economy - but it nevertheless constitutes an important feature
of this movement. It explains why the NUM, the NCB and the government have
not been able so far to put through their rationalisation plans. Scargill
will just have to wait for miners to get demoralised before he is able
to impose his new productivity plans for British coal.
<p>After nine months of struggle many miners are realising that they haven't
got much more to lose in this system of wage-labour; on the contrary, through
struggle, and in spite of all hardship that comes with it, they have experienced
relationships, activities based on class solidarity instead of humiliating
bourgeois competition.
<p>Another important feature of this struggle is its massiveness. The strike
has spread to all pits, to all areas, except for some (F.i. Nottinghamshire).
It spread because of spontaneous class-solidarity (based on the class-interests
all workers have in common) actively organised during the first few weeks
of the strike - when the NUM had not yet recognised the strike on the national
level - by miners who efficiently picketed indistinctly on mines and factories
of other sectors. Later on these pickets were replaced by union organised
pickets, disorganising and confining the strike (see later on), but nevertheless
the strike remained massive, and on some occasions managed to draw workers
from other sectors into action, despite the unions' efforts to prevent
this. Workers of other sectors recently have been showing signs of discontent
and militancy (hospitals, railway workers), but this mobilisation from
more or less large sectors of the working class remains far below the level
it reached during the 1979 strike-wave.
<p>The attempt of Dockers to come out on strike twice already (July, August)
each time sabotaged by the unions, is most clearly the sign of workers'
solidarity. By trying to join this movement and making it more massive,
other workers not only reinforce the miners' pressure on the NCB, on the
unions and on the government, but they also take advantage of the uncomfortable
position of the bourgeoisie which is scared to death at the thought of
a general paralysis of production. Thatcher, usually so firmly opposed
to all concessions, all of a sudden recommended important rises of wages
to directors of other working class sectors (steel, railways,...). This
shows that the proletariat's strength lies in the generalisation of its
struggles to all working class sectors. But a fundamental condition for
all generalisation, as the first few weeks of the strike showed us, is
the autonomous organisation of the working class, a condition which today
is -nearly- completely absent from the strike. This allowed the NUM to
take a -nearly- full control of the strike.
<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">The unions against the strike</font></u></h2>
As always, as everywhere, the unions have been attacking workers' militancy
for a generalisation and a radicalisation of their struggle, as well directly
by opposing it face to face, as indirectly by deviating the struggle from
its proper aims. Especially when a union is radicalising its policy, when
it is calling for generalisation, for mass picketing, as it is the case
in today's miners' strike, it just means they're having a tough time trying
to control and finally destroy workers' militancy.
<p>The strike, at its very beginning, started in spite of the unions (Yorkshire
and Scotland). Unlike last year when the NUM openly and directly sabotaged
wildcat strikes (involving l5,000 miners) in Scotland (Polmaise Pit, Solsgirth,
Comrie and Seafield), this time one week after the start of the strike
the unions decided to officialise it, be it, at that moment, only in the
most militant areas. At that stage, Yorkshire miners started picketing
every Nottinghamshire pit, trying to get miners there to come out on strike
also. But the NUM's backing the strike in Yorkshire only and the deal worked
out between the unions whereby Yorkshire miners wouldn't picket Nottinghamshire
in return for a "2 day strike" of Nottinghamshire miners until a ballot
was held, demobilised pickets and allowed for the NCB and the government
to use this most precious time to bring in 8.000 policemen. The following
Monday the Nottinghamshire coalfields were under police control. This is
how the NCB was enabled to keep 38 pits working!!!
<p>This shows clearly that even if we are separating -in this article-
the different aspects of the strike so as to analyse in detail the specific
role of each bourgeois party (left, right, unions, police, media, NUM's
counterinformation...) - and also for the sake of the clearness of our
explanations - we must never forget that all these aspects are linked together
organically, because they are determined by the same class reality, by
the same need for maintaining the system of wage-slavery.
<p>Each party can play a specific role, specific roles (repressive, conciliatory,
civil, military, informative,..). But also each party, at any time, can
play each role, all roles. For instance, the unions usually rely on the
credit they have within the working class to put through their plans for
austerity; as soon as the credit they have is melting away, they have to
rely direct1y on their repressive capacities to continue to defend their
interests and those of the capital. Many strikes have shown this, the unions
in Eastern European countries (including Solidarnosc***) show this, and
history has shown this. It is the class reality that determines their practice.
<p>The NUM has been campaigning for "British coal", against pit closures,
arguing that there were no "loss-making" pits. So workers shouldn't fight
for their own class-interests, but should defend British coal, which comes
down to defending the competitiveness of British coal against French, Belgian,
Italian or Russian coal. The NUM's watchword "British coal!" synthesises
the whole program of counter-revolution: accept to sacrifice yourself for
the sake of the competitiveness of the national economy on the world market,
and this logically will lead you to accept the sacrifice of your life to
defend "your" bourgeoisie in the war that opposes you to other proletarians
who are also sacrificing their lives for "their" bourgeoisie! In all countries,
the bourgeoisie has been rationalising the steel, coal, cars,... production
and this each time has required thousands of redundancies, speed-ups and
wage-cuts. In France, in Italy and in Spain it has been the socialist governments
that have been managing these measures of economic "purification"; each
time they have had them accompanied by social measures (like extra training
for workers or public works for young unemployed) trying to prevent workers'
reactions against these attacks on their living-conditions.
<p>The NUM, the NCB and the government are doing exactly this: they all
three agree about the need for British coal to be of high quality and of
low cost. But it is the NUM's specific role to get these productivity plans
through (which include pit closures, whatever Scargill may say about it).
In 1978 already, it was the NUM that put through the productivity deal
in mines, through which bonus became a larger part of earnings, and so
miners in richer areas, like Nottingham, earned up to L 100/week more than
miners in poorer pits, like in Yorkshire or Scotland. This productivity
deal is responsible for a lot of dissension amongst miners during today's
strike.
<p>Another of the NUM's keystones in its attacks on the strike is its propaganda
about the need for a change of government. They're deviating the class
opposition, between workers and bourgeoisie towards an opposition between
the left and the right (this is also what all the fuss about Kadhafi is
about). Apart from the productivity deal already mentioned, the Labour
Party and the unions have shown on many occasions that they have nothing
to begrudge the Conservatives for, on the contrary! Should we recall that
when the Labour Party was in government, they managed to enforce the biggest
proportional fall in the living standards of the working class since the
beginning of the century; that, during their eleven years of rule, they
closed 300 pits!!! Because of their influence on workers, their constant
references to the cause and struggles of the working class, they are still
more redoubtable enemies. Most of all, what the bourgeois class is aiming
at, is that workers leave the grounds of autonomous class-struggle and
abdicate in favour of bourgeois politics, i.e. that workers rely on bourgeois
society and bourgeois parties rather than fight them! A change of government
always constitutes an attack against the proletariat and its struggles,
independently from which bourgeois fraction is coming to power. Just like
when the bourgeois class was claiming a ballot on the strike, they didn't
hope workers would reject the strike, but most of all, they wanted workers
to place themselves from within capitalist society (unions, elections...).
<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">On pickets</font></u></h2>
From the very beginning the development of the strike has been at stake
in the organisation and action of pickets. Pickets are an essential feature
of workers' struggles; they can become a real centre of struggle since
they allow more easily for all most determined workers, independently from
the sector they belong to, whether they are unemployed or not, to organise
their actions. Pickets can destroy the walls of factories in so far as
those are real barriers against our struggles.
<p>The flying pickets set up in the beginning of the strike, proved to
be very successful. Workers picketed indistinctly on all factories. The
NUM soon realised that the only way to go against this was by submitting
and at the same time transforming those pickets, i.e. by destroying them
as a means to generalise and centralise the strike.
<p>So they started denouncing pickets they did not control, they allowed
money only to pickets they had organised, they started organising symbolic
actions against scabs, mobilising thousands of strikers against a handful
of scabs (who were not able to do any work in the mine anyway) while at
the same time letting pass through many highly qualified workers (who did
continue to work in the mine - maintenance and security) alleging they
didn't belong to the NUM.
<p>Picketing has descended into a ritual shoving of pickets against police;
the struggle has become a show of clashes with cops, when the latter are
sure to win because they are well prepared and well organised. Fellow-workers,
instead of being solicited by pickets and being allowed to join in the
struggle, are being transformed into mere supporters. The huge stocks of
coal that pickets can use as an important arm (paralysing other factories,
distribution of coal to other proletarians,...) were used by the NUM as
a means to negotiate union solidarity from other factories, bargaining
coal "for heating only"(!) against some act of "solidarity" (sometimes
money, more often moral support!).
<p>Union mass picketing has become a means to canalise workers' class anger
into the deadlock of sterile confrontation with police. That's why Scargill
had to justify certain acts of violence. He says he understands the violence
miners use to defend themselves against police brutality (!); but when
he denounces police violence and supports the miners defending themselves,
it is only in the name of democracy, for the better sake of law and order.
Each time miners have left this bourgeois ground of democracy, as they
have on many occasions, and have started organising their violence, i.e.
attacking police offensively, destroying State and NCB properties, then
Scargill just like all other bourgeois denounced the vandals, the hooligans,
the provocateurs, calling for police and justice to put a stop on this.
Not only do unions claim efficient, well equipped police forces, not only
do they militate for the constant improvement, i.e. the reinforcement of
the whole judicial body, but all this, so they say, is for the sake of
the working class. To turn each worker into a delator, into a potential
cop watching his fellow-worker, denouncing each manifestation of insubordination:
that's their ideal! They really are the watchdogs of capital!
<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">On repression</font></u></h2>
In England, but even more so abroad, public opinion praises the commendable
understanding that seems to govern social relations. According to public
opinion (the sum of ideas of all citizens, of all individuals dispossessed
of themselves and of their activities and conscience), social conflicts
are rare in Britain, workers have strong unions, representative of their
interests, negotiating around the clock for workers' sake, and even when
workers have to come out on strike, they proceed decently, without violence,
respecting law and order! And isn't the British "bobby" also a gentleman?
<p>Here, just like everywhere else, when they stand up for their interests,
workers have to confront the cannibalism of society, organised centrally
within the State. Not only do workers have to confront the violence of
the State, all fractions united, but they also find in front of them the
world-wide coalition of all bourgeois states!
<p>During this strike, the State has mobilised all its forces against the
working class. All parties, all unions, all police forces, all media, all
specially trained riot-squads are on their feet 24 hours a day, trying
to get miners to go back to work. We have already explained the role played
by the unions in this struggle. We now want to insist on the role of the
police and the media.
<p>In order to deny and negate the class-character of society and of all
conflicts that shake this world violently, capital has to deform, mystify
and obscure the reality of today's commodity relationships constantly.
The dominant ideology - mediated by all existing information channels,
TV, papers, conferences,... - is a materialisation in thought of the terror
the bourgeoisie imposes in practice on its class-enemy. All media, claiming
to be organs of information on objective reality, on actual facts, on concrete
events, on statistical data, pretend to allow for a true appreciation of
reality. In fact, they are nothing else but the adequate vehicle - medium
- to reflect a mystified world from which  all social antagonisms have been
evacuated. But in order to make class-reality disappear from social consciousness,
it is not enough for the bourgeoisie to simply describe reality from a
non-class point of view (point of view of the dominating system), it also
has to simply hide (by not talking about it, by destroying all elements
relative to this aspect of reality) the facts of class-struggle, especially
when this reality is becoming more and more obvious through the aggravation
of class-antagonisms (for instance, the anticommunist nature of war, the
communist nature of workers' struggles).
<p>Not one day goes by without all TV broadcasts, all papers spitting their
filthy propaganda on our class struggle. All the fuss about some scabs
continuing to work in some mines, about miners in other regions going back
to work, all the campaigns on legal action as far as the preservation of
the holy "right to work" of some scabs is concerned, all the filth and
lies poured day after day on proletarians' attempts to resist and organise
themselves against police action, all the propaganda about the threat of
this struggle on the fate of the poor, of old people, of children, of hospitals
and schools, all this serves only one aim, making workers go back to work!
In front of this, the only reasonable reaction of miners has been to beat
up press and TV hyenas!
<p>At the same time those very reasonable gentlemen spit on all our attempts
to organise our struggle and to radicalise it, they also try to deviate
it from its proper objectives and to confine it to a conflict between different
bourgeois fractions. Incapable of recognising the reality of our struggle,
they can only see and interpret it as the difficulties of the unions to
control their "rank and file". They, time after time, try to present our
struggle as a conflict between the left and the right, or even as a dispute
between miners, between those who want to work and those who want to strike!
For sure we can count on sociologists' and psychologists' commitment to
bourgeois society to find even more subtle explanations for our strike
and our aggressiveness. More recently, the media have tried to transform
our strike by depicting it as a conflict between the East and the West
(about the NUM getting money from Libya and the Soviet Union). So the media,
independently from the journalists' will to pursue untiringly the phantom
of objectivity (the point of view objectively bourgeois!) necessarily and
harmoniously completes the repressive role of police and unions.
<p>With the lessons of the strikes of 1972 and 1974, and of the strike-wave
of 1979 followed by the unemployed's riots of 1981, still fresh in its
mind, the ruling class has been able to develop its understanding of workers'
struggle, i.e. to more clearly seize the real objectives of workers' struggle
as well as the different means of achieving them. They've been able, mainly
because the union is keeping a strong hold on this strike and preventing
miners from organising efficiently against repression, to use to the full
their whole apparatus of repression, which they've been developing since
the struggles five years ago, including the involvement of army forces,
the intervention of special trained, riot-squads, and the use of modern
electronics in this class war. When social peace is in danger, the essential
nature of democracy becomes clear: crushing the class-enemy! Is there a
clearer image of the true nature of democracy, than this daily ritual of
scabs using their right to work, trying to get into the mines escorted
by a few hundreds of riot police!!!
<p>Police systematically have been establishing precise lists of all strikers
(names, addresses, phone numbers, car numbers,...) so as to be able to
phonetap miners and identify the more militant among them, to identify
cars moving around the mining areas in the early morning hours and to break
into miners' houses, knowing exactly who to find, who's been staying overnight,
so as to arrest pre-emptively the more radical miners.
<p>Each time workers have been arrested (7O00 of them have been since the
beginning of the strike), they have been sentenced to pay huge fines in
case they ever got caught again on picket lines. This way, the State is
sure miners will think twice before joining picket lines again.
<p>On top of that, the State has taken hostages amongst the strikers, imprisoning
those miners who were particularly isolated from their fellow-workers,
mainly because they've been caught in one of the many minoritarian and
sometimes individual sabotage actions. Strikers have been unable, except
for some specific cases, to counteract this and to react to the imprisonment
of fellow-workers.
<p>The State has used cavalry charges by club wielding mounted police,
they've brought in riot-squads set up after the inner city riots, they've
set up road blocks to prevent miners from leaving their home areas - for
any reason! They have intimidated, beaten up and arrested miners trying
to make their way to picket lines, they've imposed a military siege on
many pit areas, cordoning off coalfields. At night, they've been going
into pubs to arrest miners.
<p>Should we add the "agents provocateurs", the informers they have used,
the video cameras to film pickets and identify people later on, should
we mention that they have "handcuffed, photographed and locked up miners
for twenty-four hours, merely for being on a picket line"? (Sunday Times)
This strike shows that democracy means to beat up strikers, to starve them,
to kill them!
<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">Perspectives for this struggle: the need
for workers' autonomy!</font></u></h2>
We have already said that the overall direction of the strike remains firmly
in the hands of the NUM. In the 1979 steel strike workers tried to picket
in spite of the unions and they sometimes succeeded (the violent picketing
at Hadfields against the dispensation issued by Bill Sirs exempting Hadfields
from the strike!). Even four years ago, in February '81, Welsh miners,
and also miners in Kent and in Scotland, decided to ignore Scargill's appeal
for a return to work when they came out as soon as they had heard about
the plans to shut down twenty pits. When the strike collapsed a few days
later (Scargill sabotaging all generalisation attempts, telling Yorkshire
miners he had received "assurances" from the NCB) angry Kent miners went
to the NUM headquarters in London, and Scargill needed police protection
to get in.
<p>In today's miners' strike, since the very beginning workers have been
placing all their faith in the actions of the NUM and of other unions to
help them in their efforts to spread the strike. The whole episode of the
NACODS "mobilisation" about getting paid for crossing picket-lines' illustrates
just this when workers don't take into their own hands the organisation
of their struggles, they remain at the mercy of the unions' intrigues.
When the NACODS finally cancelled its strike threat, many miners became
discouraged and even more passive. If the strike had been organised more
actively by miners, like during the first few weeks, the scabs from the
NACODS would never have been allowed to cross picket lines in the first
place!
<p>All calculations about how to use for one's own interests the contradictions
between different bourgeois parties always fail to becomes true: on the
contrary, they disorganise! When workers don't organise, don't act for
themselves, directly against all bourgeois fractions, the only thing that's
left for them to do is to implore the "aid" of humanists, democrats, progressists,
leftists, Socialists and Communists (!) to protect them from the all-out
State repression. Capital will be merciful towards its subjects but only
on the condition that democracy reigns again, i.e. that workers, after
having the most radical amongst them being terminated, "accept" to return
to work for lower wages. Our class has witnessed this scenario all throughout
the long history of its struggles.
<p>In spite of the NUM' control on the strike, workers, to some extent,
have been organising actions that the unions disavowed, especially as far
as sabotage actions and attacks on police are concerned. The extent these
actions have taken in recent months (and this will probably continue) indicates
a growing dissatisfaction with the way the strike is going:
<p>- there have been full scale riots, with arson attacks and with barricades
being set up;
<p>- there were attacks on police stations (at Hemsworth, Maltby, Armthorpe,
Plexborough, Garv, Betws, Easington); during the Fitwilliam riot workers
laid siege to a Police station to prevent police from arresting a miner,
they later on destroyed NCB offices.
<p>- there have been organised attempts to bypass the unions' set piece
mass picketing, more particularly by workers ambushing police in guerrilla
style operations (Silverwood pit near Rotherham)
<p>- scabs have been efficiently intimidated, terrorised!
<p>- on many occasions, there has been organised sabotage, ignoring union
pleas to respect private and State property! "Vandals caused an estimated
&pound; 250,000 damage at NCB offices at Cadeby, St.Yorkshire" while police
didn't intervene "because of violence from pickets at Cadeby colliery opposite
and other vandalism by strikers" (The Times, 20/11/84). In Liverpool, a
transport company has been attacked! Pits have been flooded by miners (making
them inexploitable for a long, long time, like Polkemmet pit in Scotland).
<p>- the NCB has been reporting on "pickets wearing paramilitary uniform,
building barricades and stoning any vehicle passing through". "Hit squads"
have caused vast amounts of damage.
<p>So miners have been trying on many occasions to organise themselves
against the NCB, against police, but without ever attacking the NUM; actions
have been organised parallelly to NUM's actions, never against them. That
is the main reason why these actions have remained isolated, never have
been centralised, in spite of their multiplication in recent months. This
is criminal for the future of the strike, because it means the NUM will
be able to remain in control of the struggle, "tolerating" these violent
actions!
<p>The future of the strike depends on the most militant workers' capacity
to clearly designate the NUM, like all unions, as a class enemy and to
take into their own hands the conduct of the struggle, i.e. to give clear
directives, to designate clear objectives to strikers. This is essential,
especially today, when more and more miners are getting pissed off about
the way the strike is going, and need more than ever a clear centre of
direction, of struggle. All proletarian efforts and actions must not remain
scattered, and isolated (making it more easy for the unions and police
to repress them and, by their filthy propaganda, to isolate them even further)
but have to be united, centralised into one clear direction of confrontation
with the whole State (unions, bosses, Labour, government and all bourgeois
parties) and of generalisation of the struggle to all workers!
<p>There is no need for waiting for all miners to agree on the true nature
of the NUM; it is now that the most radical workers must organise themselves,
on a national level, against the unions, and become a centre of struggle.
All the proletarian actions we have mentioned have been assumed and organised
by workers or groups of workers, in spite of the other miners' opinions
about it! Those actions have been assumed by the most determined workers,
because they are indispensable to the development of the strike. Today's
development of the strike requires more than ever the autonomous organisation
of strikers and the centralisation of all actions. This will also be a
decisive condition for workers from other sectors to join the struggle.

*** Solidarnosc has expressed its solidarity (!) with the miners' strike
by sending the following message to the Polish government denouncing the
exportation of Polish scab coal to Britain: "The conquest of foreign markets
through the practice of competitive prices, i.e. prices below world market
prices, is a denial of the Jastrzebic agreement, where it has been admitted
that coal is a national source of wealth which has to be exploited in a
rational manner. With such prices, investments in the coal industry can
only increase the deficit of our national economy. Only bad capitalists
(sic!) and dictators act like this!" (Labour Focus, vol.7, No 2,London).
<blockquote><font face="Comic Sans MS">"What Marx and Lenin emphasised
about the state - that despite the formal democracy that it professes,
its organisation makes it unsuited to serve as an instrument for proletarian
revolution - applies equally to the trade-union organisations. Their counter-revolutionary
strength cannot be destroyed or diminished by a change in personnel, by
the replacement of reactionary leaders with left-wing or revolutionary
people." (Gorter, p.6 of "Oppositionist" edition)</font></blockquote>

We are publishing here one of our leaflets which as been distributed in
Yorkshire during the miners' strike.
<p>AUTONOMOUS ORGANISATION OF THE WORKING CLASS
<p>GENERALISATION OF THE STRUGGLE TO ALL WORKING CLASS' SECTORS
<p>SABOTAGE NATIONAL ECONOMY
<p>NO COMPROMISES
<p>After the struggle of steelworkers in France and Belgium, after the
revolts in Tunisia and Morocco, in Brazil and South Africa... how could
anyone continue to pretend that what's going on here only concerns us as
far as coal goes, as far as Britain goes!
<p>By going on strike against wage cuts, against redundancies, we call
upon the whole working class to join our struggle because today all working
class' sectors in all countries are facing similar attacks.
<p>While the strike originally started as a refusal of tens of thousands
of redundancies that the government still wants to impose, the unions try
to transform the struggle into a support to the British economy! The unions
just translated "no redundancies" into "coal for Britain" as if being exploited
in coal-mines was better than being exploited in oil-refineries, or in...
porridge factories!
<p>The NUM demands a stop in coal imports, an increase in exports, a rise
in coal investments, etc. but where the hell does all this take into account
the interests of the workers!! We don't give a shit about the difficulties
"they" have in managing their system!
<p>The unions imprison the workers on the bourgeois field of competition
(coal against oil, Britain against France), they check pickets so they
won't move around too much (that's why the NUM allows money only to pickets
it controls), they organise symbolic actions against scabs, transforming
the struggle into a show of clashes with cops (when the latter are sure
to win because they are well prepared and well organised), they prevent
strikers from destroying stocks... That's how the unions prevent a real
generalisation of our struggles, that's how they faithfully accomplish
their duty as watchdogs of capital. How could a change at the head of the
state possibly reduce our exploitation? What we want is not to bring down
Thatcher so as to replace her by Scargill or by the Labour party; they
all, Mitterand as well as Thatcher, as well as Reagan or Alfonsin impose
the same anti-working class politics.
<p>When Scargill says he wants to "generalise" our struggle, he is only
trying to get new credit for his union, to overthrow Thatcher so as to
put forward another alternative capable of imposing the sacrifices needed
to save the British economy. They all just want to negotiate the price
of our blood!
<p>What we want is to destroy completely this system of wage-slavery! Comrades,
to reinforce our struggle means to:
<p>- ORGANISE OURSELVES AUTONOMOUSLY IN SPITE OF AS WELL AS AGAINST UNIONS
<p>- GENERALIZE OUR STRUGGLE BY UNIFYING CLAIMS
<p>- USE DIRECT ACTION SABOTAGING NATIONAL ECONOMY, DESTROYING STOCKS,

We are publishing here a leaflet that has been sent to us by the FITZWILLIAM
PRISONERS' AID GROUP from Yorkshire. That group is organising help for
the imprisoned miners, for all those who "have gone too far" in the eyes
of the State. The information activity is one of the revolutionaries' most
important tasks which is to be supported and developed particularly today
because the lack of international connections between revolutionary minorities
is still an important deficiency at this point of time. In complement to
the publication of this leaflet, we give a summary of our essential positions
on the question of prisons.
<p>CLASS WAR PRISONERS' AID
<p>For eleven months the miners have been on strike against the destruction
of their jobs and communities.
<p>For eleven months the State has used all the means at its disposal to
try to break the strike - media lies, money and force.
<p>Despite constant claims that the strike is over, despite bribes for
scabs and the use of far more expensive fuels, despite the massive police
presence in pit towns, mass arrests, oppressive bail conditions, curfews,
etc., the miners have refused to bow down before the bulldozer of profitability.
<p>There have been thousands of arrests and numerous long prison sentences
for struggling against the imposition of poverty.
<p>We support all those imprisoned for supporting their communities, their
standard of living and their colleagues, and we are collecting money for
them and their families.
<p>When the occupying police force in Fitzwilliam, North Yorkshire, tried
to arrest a well-known miner, he refused to co-operate and a riot ensued.
All sections of the working class joined in, building burning barricades
from material and vehicles (including cranes) taken from the pit. The police
captured nine people. Despite the Yorkshire NUM's attempts to sabotage
solidarity with the prisoners (including taking away the Fitzwilliam branch
minibus) the Fitzwilliam Prisoners Aid Committee have continued to give
active support to their imprisoned comrades.
<p>Like many other prisoners, miners and other working class people nicked
in connection with the miners' strike are inside for trying to resist poverty,
for crimes against capitalist property and its enforcers. To segregate
them as political prisoners would be to isolate them from the rest of the
working class. The divisions between different sections of workers and
between the employed and the unemployed must be broken down on both sides
of, and across, the prison walls. As long as there are prisons for those
who resist, we are all enslaved, and as long as there is poverty of dole
for those who demand better pay and conditions, we will all be pushed down
into poverty.
<p>Only working class solidarity can free the prisoners. The liberation
of the working class is the task of the working class ourselves.
<p>If you wane to help the class war prisoners, come to our weekly meetings,
Thursday 6:30 pm at 355 Holloway Rd. London N7, or send donations to Box
CWPA at the same address.
<p>Any cheques should be made payable to: "Max Holz Committee".

<h1>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Prisons against the proletariat</font></h1>

<h3>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">1. Introduction</font></u></h3>
The reinforcement of social antagonisms between proletariat and "bourgeoisie"
is creating preoccupations at the front line of the two classes: the reinforcement
of repression measures on one hand, and the proletariat's answers to that
repression on the other hand. Because if the world-wide crisis exacerbates
the competition between the different fractions of the bourgeoisie, there
is a sphere where they all do agree: the repression against what will be
its gravedigger: the proletariat.
<p>Everywhere, in all States, the repression measures are directed against
all the people, all the social activities that disturb "public security",
which means the normal course of production and the circulation of commodities.
Millions of imprisoned workers are kept in the State's prisons as hostages,
to ensure the bourgeois order.
<p>Flying pickets, wild strikes, sabotage actions... all manifestations
of strength by the proletariat are condemned by regulations such as the
"right to strike", the "right to work", etc. They are considered as "bandit
activities" or as some provocateurs' work. All workers' associations are
at the mercy of the new "anti-terrorist" repression measures of the bourgeois
State. In front of all these bourgeois terrorist campaigns, which direction
must the counter-repression measures and the solidarity with/between the
imprisoned proletarians take?
<h3>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">2. The prisons as a condition of the existence
of "the best possible world"... Let's destroy all the prisons! Solidarity
with all the imprisoned struggling against the bourgeois state</font></u></h3>
Capitalism has only liberated society from the obstacles that prevented
the bourgeoisie from developing the exploitation of the working class and
improved the institutions bequeathed by the previous ruling classes, such
as the prisons, the jails or hard labour...
<p>The bourgeoisie has only taken the heavy and cumbersome chains away
from the slaves while it has submitted the entire humanity to the meshes
of capitalist production and in the same time the reclusion, the imprisonment,
the social exclusions have reached their ultimate development. The State
repression has become institutional, permanent and normal thanks to the
subtle game of Justice which gives it its apparent exteriority, exclusivity
and segregation.
<p>The repression, which is present at all degrees in prisons (isolation,
close watch, persecutions, tortures...) has become the guarantee of the
general interest! To impose itself to the citizens, to the "free people",
as the code of behaviour, the society of commodities needs the speeches
of the priests, of the democrats and the humanists, but also needs spaces
and special places to learn "freedom", to re-educate to the "civic values",
to intimidate and exclude all the unhealthy elements, all the "social misfits"...
all those who are suspected of not respecting the laws and rules of the
merchant society. Prisons are not only used to withdraw the trouble-makers
generated by society but also to persuade the "sane", the "good" and "honest"
people of their privilege to live in the best possible world...
<p>Prisons are a necessary condition for the existence of "the best possible
world", the prisoner is nothing but the counter-image of the "free man"
without which he wouldn't know the price of his freedom, the virtue of
his morals and the equity of social Justice!!!
<p>The guardians of peace cannot be but armed guardians: the guarantee
of "freedom" depends on the efficiency of the reclusion places... Such
is the unbearable and contradictory reality of civil bourgeois society,
codified in the penal right and achieved by Justice, its tribunals and
its prisons.
<p>It is not in the name of "God's will" but in the name of laws that the
bourgeoisie does inflict the measures required for the functioning of civilised
society to the working class.
<p>All the proletarians thrown in jails are subject to the most extreme
proletarisation and undergo the yoke of the interests of Capital reproduction
in some intense social conditions of oppression: reclusion, persecutions
(alimentary, sexual...), political and social isolation, total submission,
etc.
<p>All of them are used as hostages of the bourgeoisie, entrusted with
serving as examples, with terrorising the proletarians who still have the
privilege to choose where they are going to sell their working force.
<p>Situating the question of prisoners outside the bourgeois content and
against the criterions of innocence or guilt, of justice or injustice as
defined by the bourgeoisie itself means in no way to idealise the prisoners
and the delinquents, nor to find them in a position of being radical and
special revolutionary proletarians, but it means giving to the struggle
the fundamental axis on which we must build the proletarian answer to the
repression and organise the struggle of all imprisoned workers.
<p>We never situate our criterions of solidarity with the prisoners according
to their degrees of criminality, guilt or honesty. Those criterions are
initiated by the torturers.
<p>For us the most important thing is to establish a class line between
the prisoners and the jailers based on a practice of common reaction against
the repression, the persecutions (for example through prisoner associations;
through putting prisoner solidarity in direct connection with the taking
over and the participation in the various requirements of the struggle
against repression; through the fight against repentant denouncers and
pressions on the scabs and on the over-zealous warders...).
<h3>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">3. Amnesty and political statute against
the constitution of a class strength, against the liberation of proletarians</font></u></h3>
When it imputes the cause of imprisonment, detention camps, massacres,
to the excesses of one kind of government, or of one political gang, or
to the misuse of authority of one leader..., the bourgeoisie cleans its
dictatorship, the dictatorship of the capitalist social system: democracy.
<p>When the State imprisons, tortures and kills systematically, the bourgeois
denounce the errors of management, the illegitimacy of a government, the
seizure of a "fascist", a "militarist", a "bureaucratic" clique. When "red
terrorists", "hooligans", "subversive" proletarians are imprisoned, tortured
or killed, the bourgeois only see a side-slip of democracy, produced by
the imperfections of the system and by the unconsciousness of some "trouble-makers".
<p>So the bourgeoisie formally adapts itself to the proletarian claim of
freeing the imprisoned militant but it falsifies the sense of that claim
and its power completely.
<p>When it claims a special statute for "political prisoners", when it
defends the "rights of political prisoners", the bourgeoisie exalts "political
prisoners" to some category apart, whose social practice and interests
are opposed to the other proletarians' and whose defence has nothing to
do with the proletarian interests.
<p>So the "common criminals" are considered as victims of the vice, the
perversion and the selfishness that dominate them, while "political prisoners"
(in default of being the victims of those victims whose evils they try
to remedy) are considered as the victims of Authority, of the lack of tolerance,
the lack of democracy, of the rigour and the heaviness of the State.
<p>The first ones deserve their punishment and have no perspective but
to expiate and venerate the courage and the loyalty of their big "political"
brothers.
<p>The second ones are the scapegoats, the martyrs, the "free-thinkers"
and deserve, while waiting for the amnesty, a privileged lot. For the bourgeoisie's
survival, for the maintenance of pacific coexistence between fractions
of the bourgeoisie and between bourgeoisie and proletariat, it is necessary
to admit philosophical, political, religious, economic or social "opposition"
in the society, which undergoes a permanent reform and, through its contradictions,
brings about an unceasing class struggle.
<p>The political prisoners recognised by States and by their humanist'
organisations are the victims of that permanent overthrow, the victims
of the State limits of tolerance towards its reformers. The political statute
of prisoners has the function of providing the proletarians with martyrs
of the revolutionary faith, martyrs of the people's cause, of the struggle
for "work, peace and freedom": they represent the injustice that falls
down on the men of good will, who, here below, believe in a quiet development
of progress and who, in front of the capitalists' difficulty in facing
the crisis, propose remedies : new governments, news plans of reorganisation...
in order to conciliate the class conflicts, to recompose the nation, etc.
There is consequently no political statute neither for the combative proletarians
nor for the communist militants condemned because of their class belonging
and actions. Only those who disown the reasons for their condemnation have
the right of getting that statute: all the democrat rascals, the unionists...
who only preach for the liberty of being exploited.
<p>The champion of the organisations defending the political statute for
prisoners, the famous Amnesty International, supplies by itself the whole
anti-proletarian meaning of the political prisoners' statute. In order
to benefit from the support of this organisation, one must not "have done
anything against the security of the State and never have used violence".
<p>Falling in with the defence of the human bourgeois rights, and so invariably
on the side of the bourgeois State, this organisation takes a direct part
in the very democratic repression against the proletariat... By organising
the spectacular defence of the "innocent" victims of the social injustice,
it contributes to the killing of thousands of proletarians "guilty" of
having violently fought against the abject capitalist exploitation of the
proletariat. It is not only the division between "common criminals" and
"political prisoners", "guilty" and "innocent", "defensible" and "not defensible"
that the defenders of the political prisoners' statute claim and organise
but also the division between "prisoners" and "free men".
<p>Within a relation of force that is not in favour of the bourgeoisie,
at a time of important class movements, the political amnesty is nothing
but a juridical manoeuvre of the bourgeoisie trying to integrate what is
happening in the street and what it cannot avoid (see the latest struggle
in Bolivia and the liberation of hundreds of imprisoned workers), all this
within the legal context of the democratic State, of the bourgeois policy.
<p>The bourgeoisie's aim is clear: turning a relation of force that is
in favour of its historical enemy into its contrary, by taking control
of the situation. The amnesty can also achieve a reversal of the relation
of force in favour of the bourgeoisie once a State has succeeded in imposing
its power, its terror, the hostages are freed and this amnesty gives a
new credibility, a new strength to the bourgeoisie.
<p>It is only through a real action against the State, through the application
of the working class terror, that the imprisoned and the "free men" defend
and support the struggles in prisons. Any manifestation from "outside"
showing that the prisoners haven't lost the "freedom" of the "free men"
but that those "free men" reject the so-called individual and privative
privileges by revolting himself and fighting against the State, its system
of wage slavery, austerity and rigour: such manifestations give the prisoners
the strength of not getting destroyed, broken, overwhelmed.
<h3>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">4. Our tasks</font></u></h3>
Spreading communist perspectives for the struggle means in no way retreating
into an ivory tower and taking an indifferentist position such as: there
is no proletarian prisoner to defend because none of our own militants
is imprisoned; or: we can do nothing before there exists a social movement
capable of freeing our imprisoned comrades! The revolutionary movement
is not a factory of martyrs, its development depends notably on its capacity
to preserve its forces, its communist militants from the repression. The
repression by bourgeois State is a selective one (even in its massivity),
it tries to isolate the avant-garde of the class, to imprison the proletariat
in some respective roles the active are inevitably oppressed and the passive
are eternally oppressed...
<p>The dead are the evidence of its determination, the prisoners are its
hostages, and, above all, it demonstrates to the petrified class the helplessness
and the isolation, or worse, the incoherence and the irresponsibility of
any revolutionary perspective. By imprisoning communist militants, combative
proletarians, the bourgeois State fights the revolutionary movement on
its ground. But if it is obvious that communist militants run the risk
of repression, we must work in order not to give the State the possibility
of restricting our struggle ground nor the initiative of suffocating us
on its own ground by limiting the revolutionary activity to the support
of imprisoned comrades (see the R.B. in Italy) and/or worse, the possibility
to dislocate the proletarian organisations. How many "revolutionary" organisations
do abandon the fight by joining some front of bourgeois organisations,
by integrating and standing for campaigns of the democratic State, under
a pretext of solidarity (to free their militants...)? How many organisations
do find in the strength of the State some encouragement to preserve themselves
by denouncing working class terrorism (which is directly a support to pacifism),
or inversely believe that the best way to make common cause with their
imprisoned comrades is to join armed struggle?
<p>For all those reasons, we must do everything in our power to make sure
that a minimum of militants be imprisoned and that a maximum escape from
repression, so that the State will not be able to isolate us and to take
the avant-garde of the movement as hostage.
<p>We must criticise the irresponsibility of organisations that do not
take elementary defence measures for their militants and for the other
class militants: those who do not prepare some practical dispositions to
give the militants the possibility of escaping from justice and to continue
their revolutionary activity. At the same time we must criticise the erring
ways of direct action, of working class violence by clarifying the proletarian
struggle methods and by placing them in a general vision of the evolution
of the struggle relation between classes. Apart from the case of revolutionary
movements in which the class power imposes the liberation of imprisoned
comrades and in which their interest is to claim for their actions, we
know that the proletarian prisoner is most of the time alone in front of
the State. In conditions as we live everywhere in the world today, an imprisoned
militant finds himself in a situation similar to that of a revolutionary
proletarian who is alone to continue the struggle in a sector being totally
under Capital counter-revolutionary power (quiet factory, disciplined regiment...).
His atomisation only expresses the general class atomisation and puts him
on the ground of Capital. Therefore when a comrade falls in a time of such
struggle, his interest is not to play the martyr or to revendicate his
actions, but to deny them. His interest lies in using all possible ways
to get out of prison: sickness, vice of procedure, use of humanitarian
supports, use of the "U.N.O. refugee" statute, of "political refugee" statute,
use of amnesty actions... This does not mean supporting the bourgeois institutions
politically or the democratic campaigns or the reforms of justice. Nor
does it mean making front with them. We must help the imprisoned militants,
but we must know and say that it is not the class struggle ground but the
ground of Capital. We can't say that such defence is a proletarian class
struggle for it is only the extreme weakness of the class. Our main support
is the organisation of the fight against repression on the basis of class
struggle methods... The liberation of prisoners is not in itself a victory
for
the proletariat: it all depends on what class it reinforces. We cannot
separate the prisoners' liberation and the methods used to that purpose.
Concretely the first task is to destroy the wall of silence of the bourgeoisie,
the State lies and the "anti-terrorist" propaganda that assimilate working
class actions with gangsterism. And this means spreading all the information,
all the manifestos, all calls for solidarity with imprisoned proletarian
militants between the groups. It also means supporting the resistance actions
of the imprisoned against repression by organising solidarity with the
movements happening outside. The minimum to do while the prisoners have
to keep their mouth shut in front of the judges, is, for the organisation',
to defend their actions in front of the working class.
<p>It is because the proletarian organs support the prisoners' working
class actions that they can keep quiet in front of justice, risk less trouble
and can keep confidence in the struggle for the destruction of all class
violence.
<p>During periods of social open fights, some struggle organs act against
repression: this is where communists must act and develop some personal
struggle methods: direct action, terrorism against the tormentors...
<p>Let's take the examples of prisoners' struggles and resistance during
the late years: successive occupations of roofs in France; strikes in Spain
and Italy; riots, strikes and uproars against torture and imprisonment
conditions in Italy; sieges of prisons and liberations by force, in opposition
to amnesty, of prisoners in Argentina (at Villa Devoto prison in 1966)
and lately in Bolivia, Peru, Pakistan...; liberation by force of Neapolitan
proletarians who, imprisoned for their participation in important struggle
movements consecutive to the earthquake, were liberated by a mobilisation,
which central and anti-democratic watchword was: "we are all subversive";
and more other struggles in prisons in Turkey, Iran, Iraq... of which we
have had very little echo...
<p>If communist militants are constrained to have relations with some State
procedures and/or if bourgeois democrats help to save the life of a few
militants, no revolutionary militant can oppose himself to that; but what
is inadmissible is when "revolutionaries" pay for their freedom by deserting
the working class struggle and by joining their torturers' ranks.
<p>There is a limit beyond which talking about class struggle and solidarity
means bourgeois solidarity, defence of bourgeois perspectives and interests.
The fact of consciously and voluntary getting into action together, towards
one common social perspective, essentially contains the consolidation of
solidarity relations between those who act in this movement, the class
solidarity is the relation around which the proletarians associate and
unite.
<p>Solidarity is the dialectical relation of the communist militant in
relationship with the revolutionary movement. An imprisoned militant who
refuses to give any information about his comrades to his tormentors acts
by solidarity with the working class struggle that exists beyond his own
personal existence. And the revolutionaries who organise solidarity with
him from the "outside" do it because his life carries the movement further,
because the movement that is developing means "life" to this comrade. On
the ground of democracy, there is no possibility for the proletarian solidarity
to take place; the State doesn't tolerate any other community but its own,
in which men are only what they return, in which men are but exchangeable
value. The prisoners who are freed by the State and protected by its regulations
only count as exchangeable money. The prison is a destruction tool used
to dislocate the revolutionary movements. We must organise ourselves to
escape from this but also to support any expression of life in the working
class. We must organise ourselves outside and against all democratic "front"
campaigns and reinforce, spread, preserve and develop any theoretical,
practical, organisational contribution consolidating class solidarity.
Today, some combative proletarians and militants are imprisoned: our task
is to organise solidarity and to prepare the working class riposte against
repression.

<font face="Comic Sans MS">* <font size=+4>*</font> *</font></h1></center>

<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">Introduction</font></u></h2>
One of the bourgeoisie's strengths is to present the reforms needed for
the accumulation of capital as working class conquests. This is the case
of the so-called 'reduction of working time' preached by all the unions
and left parties of the world.
<p>Constantly in search of extraordinary surplus value, the capitalists
are always obliged to renew, to modernise their means of production in
order to increase productivity. The increase in productivity comes essentially
from a more continuous, more organised and more intense use of the productive
forces, among which the most important one is the labour-power. As capital
changes its methods of work, it changes labour-power as well as men themselves
since it changes the relation of men to their work. For the workers, it
always means an increase in the exploitation rate; first of all because
the salaries are never related to the production of wealth; secondly because
any increase in productivity means an increase in the labour intensity.
Under capital, the use of new machines always brings along an increase
in the division of work, a more severe, more scientific and more rational
organisation of working time, which submits the proletarian to more severe
controls, regulations and obligations. This means the 'dead times' chase,
the struggle against absenteeism, the development of the mobility of the
labour force, the continuous supervision, the acceleration of rates...
<p>Facing the perpetual reinforcement of exploitation, a steady claim of
the working class has always been and still is the reduction of working
time. This is why the bourgeoisie tries to identify this proletarian claim
with the "legal limitation of the working day" (without which the social
work could not be made more intense and more productive of surplus-value)
in order to change the workers' movement into a permanent reform of capital.
<p>The legal reduction of the working time has nothing to do with a reappropriation
of time by the workers and is only a formal reduction of the working time,
which is only measured in terms of quantity by the chronometer without
any care about its quality (intensity, density). This measure, far from
being a step towards the emancipation of the proletariat, only aims at
adapting the labour power, the living labour, to the new conditions of
exploitation, to let the workers accept to be more and more dependent of
the capitalist machines, to reinforce the division of their lives following
the needs of capitalist production, making them, in their work and in their
leisure, simple reproducers of surplus-value.
<p>The reduction of working time as the expression of the proletariat's
emancipation from its secular work slavery will only be real in a situation
of hard struggles between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie where the
working class tends to impose by force its own claims of destruction of
capitalism.
<p>It is therefore necessary to distinguish increase in productivity and
intensification of work. Under capital, both concepts are bound because
productivity cannot be increased without reinforcing the labour intensity
and the exploitation of the proletariat. Under proletarian dictatorship,
to the contrary, the increase in productivity will aim at reducing the
labour intensity, reducing the exploitation of the proletariat.
<p>Communism, because it does not need to accumulate capital and, to the
contrary, answers human needs, because it will free the development of
productive forces from the shackles of the capitalist mode of production,
will reach a much higher productivity through the abolition of work.

<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">The permanent increase in surplus-labour</font></u></h2>
While the serf, for example, works half the time on his own land and the
other half on his lord's -in this way, the exploitation appears clearly-,
the salaried worker receives a salary for his whole day of work, which
seems then to be paid completely. The exploitation of free work is hidden
by the abstract character of work under capital: "The individual works
of isolated individuals do not acquire a character of social work in the
form in which they have been carried out in the process of production but
they acquire it only in the exchange, which represents an abstraction of
the particular objects and of the specific forms of work". (I.Roubine,
Essay on Marx' theory of Value)
<p>Within the capitalist production, all commodities - including labour
power - to be exchanged, have to be equalised, reduced to the same denominator,
value or abstract work, whose measure is the social working time crystallised
in it, necessary for their production or reproduction. Any good is therefore
sold at its value (the law of supply and demand makes the prices oscillate
around an average). Now precisely, the worker sells his labour power by
the day while, for example, one hour of work would be sufficient to produce
the value necessary for the reproduction of his own force; by working one
hour a day, the worker would have produced enough goods to be exchanged
against his means of survival (food, clothes, lodging...). The salary is
the payment for this necessary work without which the proletarian would
not be able to preserve or reproduce himself.
<p>In this way, by paying the labour power at its value, the capitalist
can appropriate himself the work performed during the rest of the hours
of the day without owing anything to the proletarian since he respects
the contract and the principle according to which any merchandise is sold
at its value. This part of the work which is stolen by the bourgeoisie
is called surplus-work; the value created during this surplus-work is called
surplus-value; the rate between the necessary work and the surplus-work
or between the salary and the surplus-value is called the rate of exploitation.
<p>We have just seen the worker's day could be divided into two parts:
the necessary work and the "surplus-work". The capitalist mode of production
can only develop itself by reducing the necessary work and by increasing
the "surplus-work". For the communists, the rate between necessary and
surplus work is fundamental: not only the reduction of daily working time
is compatible with the extension of surplus-work, but it is one of the
elements used to extend this free work. In order to increase surplus-work,
the capitalists have the possibility to lengthen the working day but the
workers' struggle for the reduction of working time has been one of the
elements that pushed the capitalists to increase surplus-work by reducing
the necessary work (1).
<p>"But when the surplus-value has to be produced by the conversion of
necessary labour into surplus-labour, it by no means suffices for capital
to take the labour process in the form under which it has been historically
handed down, and then simply to prolong the duration of that process. The
technical and social conditions of the process, and consequently the very
mode of production must be revolutionised, before the productiveness of
labour can be increased. By that means only can the value of labour power
be made to sink, and the portion of working day necessary for the reproduction
of that value be shortened." (MARX, Capital)
<p>If a capital A, by new production techniques, can produce a larger amount
of goods with less workers than its rival, it will have the possibility
of selling its products at a lower price than its rival (it has to if it
wants to sell the largest amount of goods), but, of course, at a higher
price than their cost of production (less living work is crystallised in
them and therefore less salary and more profit) until the value of identical
commodities on the market decreases as a consequence of the generalisation
of the production process and until the extraordinary surplus-value disappears.
This is the process that pushes capitalists to find new technical innovations
because it is only by winning rival markets that they can win this extraordinary
surplus-value.
<p>So every capitalist is forced to increase surplus-labour by reducing
necessary-labour and therefore, increase productiveness and decrease the
social work crystallised in each commodity and, in this way, decrease their
value. This value decrease is also applicable to labour-power, which means
a reduction of necessary labour. Temporarily, this decrease in the value
of labour power gives the possibility to achieve an extraordinary surplus-value.
But in this need for reducing necessary labour lies the basic contradiction
of all the capitalist system, between the permanent processes of valorisation
and devalorisation. Although the only source of profit, surplus-value,
is nothing but the living labour included in any commodity, the increase
in productiveness (or raising of the organic component of the capital)
always means an increase in dead labour (technological development) or
regard to living labour (labour power development). Hence the achievement
of extraordinary surplus-value increasing the falling rate of profit.
<p>One can therefore understand that the investment expenses grow continuously
and tend to lower the profit rate (rate between profit and invested capital).
In the same time, the constant decrease in the value of commodities causes
an accelerated devalorisation of constant capital: buildings, machines.
The redemption of these machines has to be made in an always shorter time;
this requires a maximum production rate of the working forces: it is necessary
to work the machines night and day to extract enough surplus-value and
decrease the cost of labour power. This is why, under capitalist production,
any increase in productiveness means an increase in the proletariat's subjection
to the machines, to dead labour.
<p>Productiveness today is the productiveness of capital. For capital,
the interest does not lie in producing two goods instead of one for the
sake of reducing man's labour to its half. What counts before all is that,
in these two goods, a higher surplus-value will be produced to compensate
the devalorisation of the commodities produced by half as much living labour.
Any increase in productiveness causes a relative decrease in wages (compared
to the quantity of wealth produced), a decrease in necessary work and an
increase in surplus-work. The basic reality that the exploitation rate
is relative because it is social and historical makes us understand the
growing antagonism between proletariat and bourgeoisie and demystify the
"social acquirements", the "increase in the standards of living", the "reduction
of working time"...
<p>In Belgium, for example, we can see in the statistics of the "Universite
catholique de Louvain" that there has been a 11% cut in the working hours
between l960 and 1973. But what the bourgeoisie will not tell is that this
"progress" is due to the extraordinary rise in work productivity, which
allows the workers to produce the same amount of goods in 1973 as in 1960
in only 43% of the working time they spent that year.
<p>If this rise in work productivity had entirely benefited to the workers
and had only been used to reduce the working time, it could have been reduced
not by 11% but by 57%, which would mean a working time of less than 20
hours a week! (See the article "Maintien du pouvoir d'achat, un mot d'ordre
reactionnaire". In Le Communiste No 4).
<p>To limit the cost of new investments as much as possible, the capitalist
is obliged to reduce the development of constant capital. To increase productivity,
he will try, through technological developments, to intensify the work
of the proletarians. This need for increasing the work intensity will force
him to reduce the working time, not in order to reduce work but in order
to increase it.
<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">The duration of working time: an expression
of the world-wide force relationship between classes</font></u></h2>
Historically, capital has developed itself by imposing work and extending
the working day to its very limits. The descendants of serfs, who were
dislodged from their lands and sent to the first textile manufactures,
were heaped up in new industrial centres, locked up in workhouses. Those
who tried to escape, the "vagabonds", were pursued, killed and used as
examples to terrify the proletarians. The Niggers and American Indians
as well as the European serfs all ended up in the industrial convict-prisons,
factories and plantations. All of them went through the misery of the "primitive"
expropriation and it was under the terror of weapons, of hunger and misery
that they were educated to the last form of exploitation: salaried work.
<p>All the bourgeois who know a little about history admit these facts
but do not see the irreversible class antagonism revealed by them. To the
contrary, they only see them as excesses from a past that progress has
definitively eliminated, from times that are through. 0ne of their big
arguments is the reduction of the working day (16,14,12,10,8 hours). These
are supposititiously absolute facts, that could convince the workers that
capitalism is not such an inhuman system (they will then talk about the
"leisure society", the "free times era" as a fair reward for so many years
of efforts, services and work for capital. But this only shows the lies
and dreams of the stupid bourgeois understanding that substitutes the ideal
vision of its own class situation to the world's reality.
<p>In the historical centres of accumulation and concentration of capital,
the big cities (in South America, North America, Europe...), the legal
working day effectively tends to be reduced, but this is due only to the
fantastic development of productivity which allows capital to stabilise
class struggle and force social peace through giving "advantages" to certain
categories of workers, while in the same time they increase the rate of
surplus-value extraction.
<p>Complementarily, the only possibility of capitalist valorisation in
deserted zones is to maintain a very long working day that can compensate
the low organic composition of the capital, making the labour conditions
of these workers look out of time.
<p>In some parts of the U.S.A., for example, (which are a symbol for a
"developed society"), the extraction of surplus value takes the form of
slavery (see the article in "Comunismo" No 7 on the working conditions
of the clandestine immigrants in Texas, Florida, Virginia...). The flourishing
multinational food company "Gulf and Western" has its offices in ultra-modern
buildings in New York where the employees work under the U.S. legal standards,
and gets its raw materials in Haiti where everybody knows that sugar plantations
are real slavery-camps (work without rest, miserable wages, military surveillance...).
<p>But salaried work does not only reveal its penal servitude character
in the USA: see the camps in Siberia, South Africa, Mauritania, Mali, as
well as the concentrationary "communities" in Cambodia, China, Haiti...
In all industrial centres, (non-declared) labour is an essential stabilising
factor of the economic life. New York, Chicago, and Hong Kong all have
their "sweatshops", and the crowd of home-workers: "after eight or nine
hours of work in workshops, the employees take their piece of work home
where they work on another five or six hours,... the work conditions in
the workshops are unbelievable: it is not rare to see thirty sawing machines
piled up in a small room without any airing nor opening but the front door"
(Le Monde Diplomatique, March 1982). The "clandestine" dress-making workshops
of Paris are well-known. The factories for children in Napoli and in Bangkok
don't even surprise the bourgeois newspapers any more... "The number of
children and teen-agers of less than 15 years who work throughout the world
has increased in the last two years. Today we can count 55 millions of
them, but experts state that this number is by far underestimated, compared
to the real extension of the phenomenon (Le Monde, 10-11/5/1981, after
an investigation of the International Work Office).
<p>"Everywhere, the industrial subcontracting helps evacuating part of
the workers from the big metropolitan industry... In Italy, the small industries,
reanimated by the crisis, at the limit of legality and of clandestinity,
are often considered as the basis of the "second Italian miracle". In Japan,
recent investigations have shown that subcontracting is an essential key
of the present success of Nippon products in the world market... Forms
of home-work, subcontracting techniques and "sweating systems" that we
thought had disappeared in the West, have a new development as controlled
segments of big industry. Thus, the dispersed factory (or, as the Italians
call it, the "diffuse industry") has to be analysed as a particularity
of the new organisation of production." (Le Monde Diplomatique, January
1982).
<p>By showing these facts as excesses of the capitalist system, or as remains
of pre-capitalist societies, not only does the bourgeoisie extenuate their
real importance but it also gives credibility to "normal", "legal" work.
But in these "clandestine" workshops as well as in the "legal" factories,
the same commodities are produced to valorise capital and in both cases
the worker has to sell himself to survive. The needs of the proletarians
working there are never satisfied: unemployment for example mainly touches
the "official" industry workers, and it is the same bourgeois misery that
feeds the black markets and industrial convict-prisons. For us, there is
no real difference between the proletarian labour in New York and in the
Siberia mines, it seems to us vital to assert the similitude of wage-slavery
all over the world (see the article on "worker-aristocracy" in "Le Communiste"
No 10/11).
<p>Some bourgeois claim that the "historical" diminution of labour time
is a materialisation of worker acquirements, an evidence that capitalism
and socialism can coexist and that there can be a progressive way from
one to the other. It is always dangerous for the bourgeoisie to alter labour
time reductions it gave up under class struggle pressure without compromising
the credibility of its social system (i.e., the 40 hours in France in 1936,
the 8 hour day in "Soviet" Russia and in Germany after the revolutionary
struggles of 1917-1923).
<p>After the crushing of the revolutionary wave of the twenties in the
name of the workers' well-being, the bourgeoisie had to increase productivity
all of a sudden in order to increase the exploitation rate. The deep and
violent changes in the organic composition of the capital (increase in
constant capital in proportion to the variable capital) led to an exacerbation
of competition and conflicts between the different accumulation centres
of the capital. The valorisation of capitals meant taking the rival productive
forces or destroying them. It is those mutual destruction, especially of
labour power, the generalisation of work-camps to all the planet, following
very closely the "social acquirements" of the working class movement.
<p>In 1948, when the English parliament voted the first laws of limitation
of the working day (the Factory Act), it was already to put an and to a
worker agitation that threatened to turn into a civil war. After the 10
hours legislation that also brought a wage-cut of 25%, the "working class,
declared as criminal, was struck by prohibition and put under the suspect
law" (Marx - Capital). In the same way, in France, the reform promulgated
after February 1848 "dictates at the same time to all workshops and manufactures,
without distinction, the same limit to the working day (...) and puts as
a principle what had been obtained in England only for minors and women"
(Marx - Capital). But it was immediately followed by the bloody slaughter
of June insurrection in Paris. With this link between "the constant pressure
of the workers acting from outside" and the legal intervention, the bourgeois
rapidly transformed the class struggle into a struggle for the conquest
of rights and the social laws produced by the state to reform its own system
as "social acquirements".
<p>It was under the pressure of a possible proletarian revolt that the
bourgeois class unified, in spite of the difficulty, in the State, which
represents general interests. The laws reducing the working day appear
when the division of work comes to the point of making all industries dependent
one upon another and when it becomes vital for "everybody" to avoid social
troubles due to the excesses of some behind- hand capitalists, when these
troubles compromise the interests of capital. So it becomes necessary for
social reproduction to adapt the workers to their tools (which are continuously
revolutioned) and to their new living conditions. This is why, for example,
the State makes laws to limit the women's labour time and suppresses children's
work, but in the same time establishes obligatory school and a family code
(obligation of thrifty work at home).
<p>But despite the reduction of labour time, the time of the worker is
every day more submitted to the capital's necessities. Would it be his
working time, the transportation time between his home and his working
place, the time he needs to be in order with the administration, the police,
the unions, the social security, etc., the time for professional formation,
the time for taking care of his professional harms, the time for reproducing
his labour power... all this social time belongs to the capital.
<p>The social laws only materialise the bourgeois pretension to manage
a production system based on work slavery with a scientific and humanitarian
legitimity. They are nothing but formalisation of the bourgeois humanist
and humanist principles, that "the worker sells his labour power in order
to reproduce it and not to destroy it" and "the interest of capital itself
is to ask him a normal working day".
<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">The so-called "historical" reduction in France</font></u></h2>
Affected by the world crisis, all states have to face their "growth rate"
-profit rate- collapsing. There is a surpllus production of goods and in
the same time a quick devalorisation of constant capital; which force the
capitalists to reduce investments. To fight this investment crisis (called
"capital leakage" by the left and by the unions), the bourgeoisie will
always try to find a new "industrial restructuration" (discovery of new
organisation forms and of capital management). But the capitalists are
unable to understand and to fight the reasons causing devalorisation: the
growing contradiction between exchange value and use value. The measures
they take only postpone the unavoidable bankrupt of their industry and
impose the dominant class interests to the proletariat. By putting in question
of form (neoliberalism, or Keynesian politics, self-management, or co-management)
the causes or the answer to the crisis, the bourgeoisie creates its own
weapons to slaughter the revolutionary proletariat. The "false consciousness"
of the bourgeoisie comes from its dominant class position, which it has
to defend. Thus, behind the government's reforms, one will always find
fundamental class interests. With the "reduction of labour time to 39 h.
a week" as it is asked for by the Socialist government in France, it is
the opening of a new systematical battle against the proletariat.
<p>All capital needs is to enslave more and more the labour power in order
to control its use, its cost, following the standards of valorisation,
restructuration and concentration.
<p>By trying to show any increase in productivity as a simple mechanical
perfection, without recognising the unavoidable intensification of work
that it lays on proletarians, the socialist government shows a purely capitalist
measure as a "worker conquest" and pushes the workers to believe that their
own interests are those of national economy. Sacrifices, austerity, discipline
and work are the very principles of "solidarity" which the government always
refers to. Behind the so-called alternative: "either unemployment or a
distribution of work that would allow a reduction of working time" we meet
the same principles and the same reality: the absolute decrease in wages
submitting the proletariat totally to the bourgeois state.
<p>There is a general tendency by all governments (whatever their political
"colour") to reduce the legal working time the "historical" shift from
40 to 39 hours in France, the decrease in official working time in manufactures
has changed between 1970 and 1979 from 44.9 to 43.2 in Great Britain, from
43.3 to 40.6 in Japan, from 39.9 to 35.4 in Belgium. From 1974 to 1980
the highest differences have been observed in Norway and Israel (4 hours).
While the working time was 40.6 hours a week in France in 1980, it reached
39.7 in the USA, 39.1 in Australia, 37.7 in Austria, 33.4 in Belgium, 32.9
in Denmark... (Le Monde, 16/2/82).
<p>The whole protocol on "the reduction of working time" on which both
the French bosses and trade unions agreed is guided by the aim of making
French industry more competitive thanks to a more systematical use of constant
capital (the duration of use of the equipment in automobile industry reaches
6150 hours in USA, 4000 to 4600 hours in Japan, 3700 to 4000 hours in France
- INSEE Statistics) and more flexibility iin the distribution of work (in
the USA as in Japan, the time-tables are well adapted to the needs of the
market and the overtime work is largely used, from 10 to 15% in Japan).
<p>"The investments in industrial equipment have decreased by 12% over
1981": such was a title in "Le Monde" of 9 June 1982. According to "Liberation"
of 14 September 1981, "since 1973 any increase in wealth has come from
a better efficiency in production". In order to fight the lack of investments,
the bourgeoisie seems to use its machines to the maximum by making them
work day and night with a more movable and less expensive mass of workers.
<p>With the aggravation of world crisis, the work by teams and by posts
has been generalised. The posted work becomes a normal thing for one third
of the workers, among whom one half works on night teams. Steel industry,
mines, textile and paper industries used to have the most posted workers:
up to 85%. For a few years, this kind of work has spread to food industry
and to the services sector. From 1957 to 1977, the percentage of workers
"in posts" in transformation industry has more than doubled. This increase
in posted work is to be related to the increase in the record of productivity:
the sum of commodities produced in the Belgian industry has almost gone
from one to three between 1956 and 1977 (following the weekly bulletin
of the Kredietbank of 17 November 1978).
<p>The French Prime Minister can say that those reforms will make the machines
sweat instead of men, that they will improve the relationship between man
and his work, that this will create new and more qualified employment,
the only statement of such measures is in contradiction with their promises:
<p>- extension of posted work with a fifth team for non-stop work;
<br>- generalisation of temporary work;
<br>- extension of overnight work for women;
<br>- week-end work;
<br>- "dead time" chase so as to make the 35 hours 35 effective hours of
work;
<br>- vulgarisation of overtime work, which will be paid only 25% more.
<p>As Minister Auroux said: "To increase productiveness is not a mechanical
operation: it's more a sort of compliance of the wage workers". The work
conditions regulate the life of workers at the rhythm of capitalist valorisation;
the often-changing time-tables disorganise the rhythm of life of the workers,
of whom many are over-exhausted. According to the B.I.T., experiments have
shown that night work require more physical and nervous energy for the
same result and that mortality is higher among posted workers. Consequently
it is really an increase in work intensity and in proletarians' exploitation
that the "39 hours of the socialist government" aim at generalising; this
is what Pierre Mauroy calls "the improvement of the relationships between
man and his work" (2). For him, as for Stalin and for all capitalists:
"man is the most precious capital". No need to wait for Raymond Barre's
congratulations to the socialist government to understand that the agreements
on the "reduction of working time" was the beginning of a big attack against
the working class.
<p>Only a few months after the legislation on working time reduction the
socialist government established what it called "pecuniary compensation",
which turned out to be nothing but a direct attack on salaries. New "solidarity
taxes" were required from civil servants, "solidarity" contracts were settled
between unions and bosses (wage- cuts from 1,6% at Gervais-Danone and B.S.N.
to 20% at Fleury-Michon): the left government generalised wage-cuts.
<p>The increases in taxes, in the prices of manufactured goods and services,
the devaluation, the blocking of salaries, the decrease in unemployment
benefits... all are direct attacks on proletarians' real salaries and help
in financing the aid to industry through "solidarity contracts" (the enterprises
that reduce working time to 36 hours a week before September 1983 will
be free from social security subscriptions for each new employment resulting
from the "reduction of working time").
<p>The constant increase in unemployment (more than 2 millions now under
the socialist government) contradicts the "socialist solutions" to unemployment.
As Minister Delors admitted that the shift from 40 to 39 hours did not
create new employment, the so-called reduction of work that was supposed
to reduce unemployment showed its true face: a systematic attack against
the working class. The new plans for employment of the French socialists
mean nothing but unemployment allowances, intensified work and general
wage-cuts. The Mauroy plans are but the repetition of those applied by
all bourgeoisie in the world.
<p>The French government, as any government, tries to distribute work in
the most productive way in order to, as an Air-France commander says, "compensate
the rigidity of the working time organisation, which often leads to insufficient
yearly use of more and more sophisticated equipment that are an obstacle
to the development of the productiveness of such equipment".
<p>The principle directing the working time limitation is, consequently,
a principle of rationalisation, productiveness of capital and intensification
of work.
<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">Conclusion</font></u></h2>
In this text we have shown how capital always tries to recuperate the workers'
struggles and claims, which express their permanent interest to work less.
The formal reduction of working time (the government's 35 hours) corresponds
to an important increase in the exploitation rate and to the surplus-value
rate extracted from the proletarians.
<p>In fact, the reduction of working time, from the capitalist point of
view (which includes all government's and unions' claims and promises),
always corresponds to a decrease in the necessary work so as to increase
the ratio of surplus work even if it is comprised in a day of 7 instead
of 8 hours.
<p>From this point of view, if the working day is reduced there must be
an increase in the intensity of the exploitation. The proletarian point
of view is completely opposed to this. The workers will always try to struggle
to limit this exploitation not only in duration but in intensity. The proletarians'
interest will be to really work less, which means to create less surplus
value and to have their salaries increased. The true workers' struggles
and claims only correspond to this historical perspective and are opposed
to the bourgeois claims, to the so-called "strikes for the 35 hours" of
the government, which mean nothing but capital's restructuration (hiding
unemployment under part-time work,...) and increase exploitation.
<p>Since proletariat and bourgeoisie have existed, the workers' struggle
has expressed, even at the first level, the tendency to reduce working
time, to increase salary whether by sabotage, theft or by strike and to
impose, at least for some time, a reduction of working time and/or an increase
in salaries.
<p>Independently of any circumstantial claim expressing a permanent historical
tendency at a certain time, in a certain place (it is sure that in some
struggles the 40 hours are a real workers' claim, while in others it means
the liquidation of the struggle) what counts is the direct antagonism to
the logic of capital, to the surplus value production.
<p>The interest of capital is to freeze any proletarian claim through legalising
it and making it a "worker victory", changing it into an increase in exploitation.
Hence the same difference of class existing between, for example, the 1st
of May, an international day of struggle, and its legalisation/transformation
into a holiday to the glory of wage slavery and between the meaning of
the reduction of working time that aims at suppressing salaried work and
its legalisation/transformation into a capitalist restructuration. Between
the reduction of working time, which corresponds to the proletarian interests,
and the same formula applied to capital's interests, there is all the antagonism
separating the revolutionary proletariat from the bourgeoisie.

<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">Notes</font></u></h3>
(1) "On the other hand, the length of the working day also has its extreme
limits although very extensible. These extreme limits are given by the
strength of the worker. If the daily exhaustion of his vital force goes
under a certain degree, he will not be able to undertake a new activity.
Nevertheless, as we said, this limit is extensible. A rapid succession
of weakly generations will feed the work market as well as a series of
strong and long lasting generations" (MARX, Salaries, prices and profits).

<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">I- Communism as an essential determination</font></u></h2>
On several occasions, we have considered the fundamental question of the
party (1). Even more so for this question than for any other, it seems
essential to us to conceive it non-separately and to place it in the whole
of the communist programme More than any other programmatical issue, the
"question of the party" has been extracted and separated from the rest
of the programme, has been conceived as a "question in itself" (the "deus
ex machina"), be it in trying to "bypass the party", "cause of all evil"
(2) or in transforming it into an "ideal should be" to which the proletarian
movement has to be modelled (3). Not one of these conceptions (and all
their numerous sub-products which all derive from the same social-democratic
mould) manages to perceive the party as the social force historically determined
to impose communism violently.
<p>Within the capitalist mode of production that dominates the whole planet
dictatorially, two social classes, two social projects exist, always more
antagonistically, and oppose each other always more violently: the capitalist
social project - wage-slavery, personified by the bourgeoisie, and which,
as a product of past history, dominates our present, our immediacy - and
the communist social project - the World-wide human community, born and
personified by the proletariat. From the most global point of view, it
is the capitalist social project that determines the law-and-order party
and it is the communist social project, non immediately perceptible reality
that determines the party of revolution. The capitalist forces, unified
against the proletariat in a single party, even if this single party takes
the shape of several "parties" which all defend the same programme, are
those which maintain, under different forms (parliamentary, bonapartist,...)
the capitalist mode of production, salariat, camouflaged and unified in
the bosom of fictitious communities (religion, nation, people,...), communities
of capital (4). Antagonistically opposed to these fictitious communities,
the proletariat affirms itself as the social force (5) that, from the beginning
of its existence, organises its struggle to destroy capitalism, to impose
a new, at last human community. In this meaning communism, as far as its
theory goes, is at the same time a description of the new community that
the proletariat is historically forced to achieve and a description of
the action the proletariat takes in order to impose its programme; it is
therefore a description of the prefiguration of communism: the party. The
essential determination of the proletarian party, therefore, is not one
or another circumstantial event at the present time, but is directly communism
itself. "Bounding over the entire cycle, communism is the knowledge of
a plan of life for the species, i.e. for the human species" (Bordiga -
"Property and capital"). That's why the tasks, the central activities of
the party never vary, for they are not, just like the party, determined
by immediate reality, but directly by the whole historical arch, from primitive
communism up to full communism. Consequently the party is communist because
in the present it represents the future and acts for its accomplishment.
The party is the indispensable condition for the instauration of communism,
and in the same time its prefiguration. This prefiguration in no way means
the constitution of utopian communities where full communism reigns (return
to the phalansteries of Fourier and other anarchist communes) but means
that in the bosom of capitalism a social force exists, which acts, which
has its own interests, which structures, organises and centralises itself,
unifying itself in order to oppose and violently destroy the existing order,
and to achieve its own essence: classless society. The whole capitalist
society divides itself more and more into two enemy sides, into two organised
forces, into two classes, two parties: one, the party of capital; the other,
the party of communism (6).
<p>Revolutionary Marxism principally retains the most general, the most
abstract level... capitalism against communism... in order to understand
the social classes and their antagonism, rejecting this way any statical,
sociological, economic view of the classes. "Classes are not statical data
but organical acting forces. They determine and define themselves in the
struggle as a movement of opposition to other classes" ("Class and party"
in "Rupture with the ICC", brochure in French of the ICG). When Marx states
"The proletariat is revolutionary or isn't at all" (Marx to Engels-1865),
he expresses that either the proletariat really acts as a class, i.e. as
a force bearing a communist project, as a party, or it does not exist as
a class, a party, leaving nothing but individuals, atomised citizens, sociological
workers, producers and reproducers of capital (7). In the same way, Bordiga
explained that "In the salient characters of its movement one can identify
a class" (Party and Class - 1921), insisting also on this central element
of our theory, namely that a class only exists when it reveals its interests,
its programme, when it organises into a party. As we noticed on several
occasions, the working class is the revolutionary class within the capitalist
mode of production because it bears the new social project, communism the
world-wide human community. Consequently, we can only grasp the very existence
of the working class as an organised social force acting to impose its
proper programme, antagonistic to all existing social order, violent negation,
destruction of capitalism, i.e. of the law of value, of salariat. This
action, this struggle of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie is its
permanent historical tendency to constitute itself as the universal party.
This way, the permanent affirmation of the communist left has been illuminated:
the proletariat acts as a class only when it constitute itself into a party.
"When we discover a social tendency, a movement directed towards a precise
goal, then we can identify the existence of a class, in the real sense
of the word. But this means that the "class-party" exists, in a substantial,
if not formal way". (Bordiga - Party and Class - 1921).
<p>The Marxist methodology (against Kantian theories) explains that the
contents - here the historical programme - is not a thing in itself to
which a certain form "adheres"; on the contrary, it is the contents itself
that gives birth to the form it already contained in a latent way. It is
the historical party that expresses the contents and the revolutionary
moving forward of the working class. This is why, without ever identifying
party and class, the revolutionary Marxism defines the transition of the
proletariat from a non-class to a class for itself (9) by its contribution,
its organisation into a party.
<p>When Marx writes the famous sentence in the manifesto of the party,
in 1847: "This organisation of the proletarians into a class, and consequently
into a political party, is continually being destroyed by the competition
between the workers themselves. But it ever rises up again, stronger, firmer,
mightier."
<p>Or still elsewhere, in the statutes of the First International, in 1872:
"In its struggle against the collective power of the possessing classes,
the proletariat can only act as a class by constituting itself into a distinct
political party, opposed to all old parties, formed by the possessing classes.
This constitution into a political party is indispensable to assure the
triumph of the social revolution and of its supreme aim: the abolition
of wage-slavery."
<p>Marx expresses undoubtfully that the only possible organisation of proletarians
fighting for communism is the organisation into a party, that there exists
but one and unique movement that, even if it might disappear in certain
counter-revolutionary periods because of the "competition between workers",
rises up again, always firmer, always clearer... that this movement is
nothing else but the organisation, the unification of the proletariat into
a class, and consequently into a party. The permanent movement of the workers
to associate themselves, to centralise themselves, to unify themselves
to defend their own interests, workers' associationism, is the motor of
the organisation into a party, of the organisation of the most conscious
proletarians around the nuclei that have been able to draw the conclusions
from past struggles, that have been able to intransigently defend the communist
programme, giving birth this way, during a period of international struggle,
to the world-wide communist party. So the only motor is class-practice
(in this sense that theory, of course, is one aspect of this practice,
just like strikes, propaganda, armed struggle... are), with clashes "spontaneously"
giving birth to multiple crystallisation, to organisations of struggling
proletarians, more or less ephemeral, which, in order to go on opposing
themselves to capital, have to unify themselves, centralise themselves
and have to understand always more clearly the very movement that animates
them, in connection with past struggles. For the proletariat, drawing more
and more critical conclusions from its past means holding the key of humanity's
future always more firmly. This permanent tendency towards associationism
for struggle, the formal structures of which are periodically destroyed,
is the historical tendency of the proletariat to organise into a party.
<p>The essential determination of the proletariat's struggle to destroy
capitalism is its revolutionary programme: communism. Communism, borne
by the proletariat, is not, in spite of all vulgar materialists, the simple
and immediate product of the sociological place of workers in the capitalist
mode of production, but is the product of the whole development of humanity,
which historically determines (Marxism is an implacable historical determinism)
the place of the proletariat at one pole of the production process, and
therefore, determines the material interests that flow from it, necessarily
engendering communism, at one and the same time as a movement of destruction
of capital and as the affirmation of the new community (10). It is the
whole of the development of the productive forces, it is the cycle of value
that determines, as a product of the whole history of class-societies,
the proletariat, collective and associated producer of value, at one pole
of the production relationships, and, at the other pole, the bourgeois
class, personification of capital, whose function is to manage this value,
and that lives from it.
<p>Classes do not exist by themselves, nor as fixed entities, but exist
only as active forces. Classes determine themselves by their practice,
on basis of the pole they hold in the production relationships and on basis
of the interests determined by those relationships. This is why the revolutionary
or reactionary character of a class can only express itself antagonistically
to the other class, one as bearer of a human community, the other as conservative
force of the relations of production that envelop and hinder the productive
forces of humanity. In capitalism, the bourgeoisie as personification of
the capitalist mode of production, necessarily is reactionary in front
of the revolutionary class: the proletariat. When we state that there can
be no class without party, this essentially means that there can be no
human collectivity being historically determined without the existence
as an active force, of its programme, its social project. Therefore, to
try to define the working class without its essential characteristic, i.e.
to be a revolutionary class, bearer of communism, can only be counter-revolutionary.
If, tendentially, the proletariat at first, by instauring its class dictatorship,
but afterwards the whole of humanity, organises into a universal communist
party - knowing that when the whole of humanity is organised into a party,
this party ceases to exist, for having engendered the universal human community,
nevertheless it is completely erroneous to identify class and party (i.e.
to put an equation mark between them), because, not only it is methodologically
absurd to identify a being with its most fundamental characteristic, but
most of all, it is extremely dangerous to identify the human collectivity
with the project, the programme that it embodies only tendentially, (and
in the same way as this collectivity is only tendentially conscious of
its project) and which therefore only tendentially becomes the project,
the programme, the party of all members of this collectivity.
<p>From the point of view of historical materialism, it is communism that
defines the proletarian movement, it is the party that defines the class.
But this historical reality exists today only as a more or less strong
tendency to destroy capitalism. Communism isn't obvious (the Italian communist
left defined it as "a fact already passed") but for an extreme minority
of the collectivity, of the class, which however will be historically forced
to realise communism. For the larger majority of proletarians, the heterogeneity
of consciousness still predominates, while as a process, considered as
a whole, the communist movement is the first movement of history completely
conscious, the first movement for which it is the consciousness of communism
that precedes and determines action. This process where, more and more,
for the proletariat, it is its consciousness, its programme that determines
its action, is the process of reversal of praxis, because, contrary to
vulgar materialism, it isn't the immediate reality that determines the
being, but its historical moving forward. This fundamental process of the
reversal of praxis isn't the apanage or private property of this or another
formal party, but is a real movement that takes a concrete form and expresses
itself through communist nuclei, groups, fractions... and even individuals.
Those, "in return", "have the task to unify themselves, to centralise themselves
internationally, in order to constitute, on basis of their practical-theoretical
convergence, the world-wide communist party" ("Presentation" - Le Communiste
No 6). So, today, just like yesterday and tomorrow, it is communism that
defines, that characterises the movement, the programme of the working
class. In the same way, Marx explained how "it is anatomy of man that is
the key to anatomy of ape", it is the superior stadium, communism - ultimate
product of the evolution of class-societies, of the cycle of value - which
is the key to the "anatomy" of the working class. The proletariat is communist,
or isn't at all. It organises into a party, or it isn't but a number of
atomised individuals ("non-class") producing and reproducing capital. "It
is from the description of communist society that Marx and Engels drew
the characteristics of the party-form" ("Origin and Function of the party-form"
- Invariance No 1 - 1968).
<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">II- Leninism and anti-Leninism: the counterrevolutionary
theory of the party (*)</font></u></h2>
Note: (*) When in this chapter we criticise as well the "Leninist" conceptions
(which of course, we find in Lenin himself) as the antithetic, the "anti-Leninist"
conceptions, in fact we want to demolish the bourgeois ideologies and practices,
products of the triumphant counterrevolution. Those ideologies both come
from the falsification, the plundering of the revolutionary programme,
in order to keep only the form, while transforming the contents in the
same time. "Leninism" therefore has nothing to do with Lenin's practice/critique.
And, besides, historically, "Leninism" (and consequently its antithetic
"anti-Leninism") only manifested itself at Lenin's death, as a mummification
and a distortion of Lenin's own critical method. "Leninism" is nothing
else but Stalinism, its opposite, "anti-Leninism", nothing else but anti-Stalinism
of stinking democrats.
<p>The methodological foundations of the Leninist theory of the Party (developed
as soon as 1900 particularly in "The immediate objectives of our movement"
and in "What is to be done?" in 1902) essentially are nothing else but
a remake, radicalised (mainly due to the different political situation
of Germany and Russia), of the dominant theory within Social-Democracy
- the Second International - of which Kauttsky was the uncontested master
and guardian of the "orthodoxy" (a "quality" he held formally from the
ageing Engels). If today militants of the numerous Leninist groups immediately
associate the qualification of "renegade" to Kautsky's name (see "The proletarian
revolution and the renegade Kautsky"), they do this, without realising
that if Kautsky was a "renegade", it is in the first place because he was
the theoretical master of the whole social-democracy, and consequently
of Lenin (but also of Pannekoek, Luxembourg,...). For the whole of this
conceptions, be it, as we see it here, about the party, but also about
capital, imperialism, "philosophy", revolution, about the national question...
Lenin never broke away completely from the social-democratic interpretations,
i.e. from the understanding and the bourgeois practices of the workers'
movement, from the understanding of the proletariat as an exploited class,
but not as a revolutionary class. And if we recognise Lenin as a revolutionary,
it is fundamentally on basis of his action which, de facto, to a large
extent was in contradiction with his own theories. Although Lenin tried
in practice to rupture with Social-Democracy (particularly by organising
the armed insurrection of October 1917), he never really pushed on those
attempts to rupture until the clear affirmation of communism, which implies
the refusal of the whole of the reformist conceptions characterising the
Second International from its very foundation (11). As to the question
of the party, of consciousness, etc., Lenin was and claimed to be a disciple
of Kautsky, whom, besides, he often quotes:
<p>"...socialist consciousness would be the necessary, direct result of
proletarian struggle. This, however, is completely wrong (...). Socialist
consciousness today can only emerge on the basis of solid scientific knowledge
(...). In fact, it is in the brain of certain individuals belonging to
this category (bourgeois intellectuals) that contemporary socialism was
born, and it was by them that socialism was transmitted to the most developed
proletarians, who introduced it into the proletariat's class struggle later
on, wherever conditions enabled them to. This is how socialist consciousness
is an element imported from the outside into the proletariat's class struggle,
and does not spontaneously arise from it."
<p>Lenin uses the same non-Marxist idea:
<p>"The political class-consciousness can only be brought to the worker
from the outside, i.e., from the outside of economic struggle, from the
outside of the sphere of the relationships between workers and bosses."
("What is to be done?")
<p>These quotations are often used to criticise the Leninist conceptions
of the party (particularly by the "anti-Leninist" current), but without
realising how the practice of the fraction grouped around Lenin tried,
in reality, to break up with the conceptions of Lenin himself (e.g. when
Lenin has to call upon the "spontaneous" movement of the proletarians who
are organising the insurrection, in order to force the central committee
of the Bolshevik party to formalise this preparation in progress) and without
understanding all implications of the criticism of the idealist-worker
conception of "importation of consciousness from the outside". To criticise
this conception does not mean, as councilists do, to deny the organisation
of proletarians into a party, but, on the contrary, means to understand
the workers' movement as a unity, to place each spontaneous expression
of the proletarian struggle into the historical line of the constitution
of the party, to place each struggle in the totality that constitutes the
communist programme.
<p>Whoever says workers' struggle, says political struggle. "All class
struggle is a political struggle" Marx stated. Whoever says political struggle,
says unity of the struggle, of the movement (even non-conscious) and of
its historical intrinsic goal. Besides, the proletarian movement cannot
be conceived, as we already wrote, without its goal, without its programme.
The essence of the kautskyist/Leninist falsification is based on the separation
of the struggles and the movement, on one hand, and the aim: communism,
the party, on the other hand. While Bernstein (rightist social-democrat)
crudely expresses this falsification: "The goal is nothing, the movement
is everything", the kautskyist orthodoxy can only answer him by introducing
a mediation, reforms, the transition-programme, the "party"... between
the movement and the goal, and confirm the dichotomy completely. As a matter
of fact, it is because Kautsky, just like Lenin, agrees with this separation,
that he is forced, in order to answer to the obvious revisionism of Bernstein,
to introduce a new element from the outside, so as to "join together again"
what he conceives as being separated.
<p>And of course, we criticise Leninism and anti-Leninism not simply as
bourgeois ideologies, as wrong ideas, but mainly as counterrevolutionary
practices on which the bourgeois ideas and ideologies can grow. Because
large fractions of the proletariat did not break away from union practices,
from reformist and legal politics, the theorisation of these counterrevolutionary
practices could impose themselves as easily as they did on the third International,
dialectically reinforcing this way the bourgeois practices of the proletariat.
It is because union practices still persisted within the proletariat that
the Unionist Red International could be created in 1920-1921 as easily
as it was, and, by its creation reinforce and answer for such practices.
So the problem of ideologies within the proletariat can never be reduced
to the simple question of "wrong ideas", "wrong consciousness" (to which
it would be sufficient to oppose a "true consciousness"), but it takes
its roots in the real existence of social forces acting in a conformist
way, giving a material basis to those ideologies. This is why each time
we stress the fact that ideologies are first of all material forces; if
a religious ideology exists, it is first of all through and because of
the reality of the earthly force of its army of priests and mollahs, of
its Vatican-State, of its capitalist interests. To destroy religion does
not simply mean to destroy the religious idea, but first of all to destroy
the social forces, the mode of production on which the religious idea was
based, justifying this mode of production. "The religious world isn't but
the reflection of the real world." ("Capital" - Marx)
<p>Lenin, like all his followers, also uses most of this theory about a
"double workers' movement", a "double centralisation" on the one hand the
"spontaneous" movement that cannot bypass the "trade-unionist" consciousness,
i.e. "economic" consciousness (we would almost say the "alimentary" consciousness),
and on the other hand the "political" consciousness, the "communist" one,
existing in itself and having to be introduced into the "spontaneous" movement
by bourgeois intellectuals, converted to "socialism".
<p>So, for Lenin, workers can only become conscious about the fact of being
exploited; they need help from outside to realise that their force is revolutionary.
This conception of Lenin and Kautsky is in direct opposition to Marx' s
position, defined very clearly in his circular letter to the leaders of
the German Social-Democracy: Bebel, Liebknecht, Brack...
<p>Once more, we can find in Lenin's works the Kautskyist separation, which
in theory separates the subject from the object, the being from the consciousness,
separates movement and goal, exploited "class" and revolutionary "class",
"economic" struggles and "political" struggles, "immediate" struggles and
"historical" struggles... (12) and which in practice has led to the criminal
separation between the "economic movement" organised by reformist unions
and the "political movement" organised by the parties of Social-Democracy
(traced from the model of German Social-Democracy), only busy with "universal
suffrage" and parliamentary trickery. This separation of the workers' movement
also meant the liquidation of the revolutionary programme and led astray
workers' struggles, directing them in the perspective of a reform of the
system. The counterrevolution that established itself with the defeat of
the Paris commune and the dissolution of the first international dominates
that period entirely (from 1871 until the beginning of this century, 1905),
and this is not only because of open repression, but also, and most of
all, under the more vicious influence of reformist, unionist, legalist,
parliamentary ideologies. In opposition to the first International, which
aimed at uniting proletarians from all over the world into one organised
force to destroy capitalism, the second International, set up in a period
of complete counterrevolution, divided the movement directly, not only,
as we have already seen it, into "economic" and "political" movement, but
also broke away from its internationalist character by grouping the proletarians
according to their countries, in a more or less federate manner, and so
it laid down, from the very start, all the bases for its participation
in the first world-wide butchery of 1914. And although the third International
rose up as an attempt to break away from the bourgeois rottenness of the
second International, and this in a period of revolutionary struggles in
the whole world, it did maintain, to a large extent, in affiliation with
Kautsky-Lenin, not only the double organisation on the one hand the third
("political") International, and on the other hand the "economic" I.R.U.,
but it also maintained the organisation according to the countries, conceived
as an addition of the different national parties, directed by an executive
(which was in fact the Bolshevik party).
<p>To this counterrevolutionary separation of the workers' movement - "economic"/"political",
"immediate"/"historical",... -reproduced as well by the "Leninist" current
as by the "anti-Leninists" (who substitute the word "soviet", supposedly
pure from any deviation, to the word "union"), correspond the legalist
ideologies - "pacific way for socialism" -, reformist, parliamentary,...
and the "non-political" ideologies, "managerist", unionist... as we have
already written in one of our reviews:
<p>"At the very source of the existence of unionism there is the counterrevolutionary
separation between, on the one hand, the so-called "immediate" struggles
- "struggles" against the "consequences" oof the system, which are left
to the trade-unions and to the ignorant workers - and on the other hand
the co-called "political" struggles - the so-called revolutionary "struggles"
left to the professionals of politics, to parliamentarians and other rascals
- unionism is therefore, historically, thee perfect complement of reformist
and parliamentary politics. The social-democratic separation between class
and party gets its prolongation with the separation between the class organised
in the unions and/or the soviets, the "immediate" or "economic" struggle
and the "political" or "revolutionary" party/struggle. Therefore unionism,
product of those separations, can only mean the "struggle" within the framework
of the system, reproducing and reinforcing it, and is incompatible with
the real communist struggle for the abolition of wage-slavery." (Action
Communiste No 6 - "Concerning a certain balance-sheet about the activity
of the group "Unemployed on struggle")
<p>The proletariat's force expresses itself, at each wave of international
struggle, not by the divisions, but by its capacity to unify, to centralise
all the proletarian expressions that are dispersed into one single force,
bypassing all the old organisational forms, produced and set by many years
of counterrevolution. This is how it is only during periods of revolutionary
struggle that the bourgeois separations are really bypassed, and so is
the competition between workers, so as to constitute, in tendency, the
beginning of a new community, which has to impose itself as a dominant
class, as a workers' state (semi-State), before negating itself through
its generalisation to the whole humanity (extinction by its extension to
the whole world).
<p>This way, the first International, the I.W.A., with all the limits typical
of its period - the difficult disengagement from the "utopian socialist"
phase, from the period of the Proudhonist, Lassalist, Saint-Simonist sects
-, materialised the "Organisation of proleetariat into a class, and consequently
into a party", much more clearly than the second "International", still-born,
and also than the third International, which very soon (13) degenerated
into counterrevolution. Indeed, the aim of the I.W.A. was "the abolition
of all class-regime" and it directly organised, as its first task, the
unification of all the proletarians, in struggle all over the world: "first
article: The Working Men's Association has been established in order to
create a centre of communication and cooperation between the workers' associations
of all countries, which long for the same aim, i.e. mutual help, progress
and the complete emancipation of the working class" (Statutes of the I.W.A.
- Marx/Engels). Obviously this first Interrnational isn't an organisational
model that we should try to reproduce today, but it expressed "more purely"
the proletarian answer of always, the organisation of proletarians from
all countries, from all conditions, from all ideological origins... around
the international fraction that was best able to theoretically and practically
defend the historical interests of the movement, in this case Marx and
Engels. It is somewhat in the same way that, everywhere in the world, from
1917 onwards, internationalist fractions, groups, "parties"... recognised
themselves in the communist and destructive character of the revolution
in Russia, and that, without knowing the programmatical positions of the
Bolsheviks, and being nearly always more radical than the latter, recognised
themselves in the party of Lenin (14). This way the tendency of always
became clear: revolutionary periods are periods of unification, of fusion,
in the heat of the struggle, between the various proletarian forces the
counterrevolution had dispersed and destroyed. The periods of counterrevolution,
on the contrary, confirm themselves as a generalised dislocation of the
proletarian forces, as a forced and imposed return of the few minorities
that still resist to the state of "sects", a situation that can only be
bypassed in a new revolutionary period. In opposition to the Kautskyist
vision, which considers the party as growing gradually until it includes
all workers (the same as the Leninist conception of the mass-party) in
order to, after having educated them, "pass on to socialism pacifically",
the Marxist vision, considers the existence of the party as a qualitative
step deriving from the fusion and the centralisation, in a revolutionary
period, of thousands of workers' groups - products of the heterogeneousness
of the class - under the single direction of the fraction that was best
able to preserve, defend, restore, theoretically and practically, the programme
of communism. It is during those short but very intense moments of world-wide
and general unification of the proletariat that the unique organisation
of the proletariat into a class, and consequently into a party takes a
concrete form in the clearest way and that the central position of Marx:
"consciousness can be nothing but the conscious being" (German Ideology)
takes a concrete form in the most visible manner, and the proletariat can
be nothing but the social-force imposing communism, imposing the party.
<p>In opposition to this "monist" totalising conception, we find all the
reactionary "theories" that originate from the social-democratic falsifications
and define "the class and the party" separately. Therefore, (and this is
the essential part of their "theory") they have to look for the many "tricks",
"transition programmes", "intermediate programmes", "transmission belts",...
that could possibly "link" the class to its party. The basic methodological
error of all these "theories" lies in the dichotomy they lay down between
two concepts - class and party -, which, for sure are different but can
in no way be separated. In the same way, life cannot be defined separately
from man, from the animal or from the living vegetal. If "life" existed
separately from man, only then the problem of the "link" between man and
life would arise. In the same way as in the Marxist concept of merchandise,
the exchange-value cannot exist, and therefore be defined, without its
support, which is the exchange-value; the concept of class cannot exist
without its tendency to constitute itself into a party. The Kautsky/Lenin
filiation on the question of the party, be it in the classical Leninist
version - Trotskyist, Stalinist, Bordiguist.... - or the antithetical version
- anti-Leninist, councilist, anarchist,.... - corresponds therefore, as
well for its methodological foundations, for its theory as for its practice,
to a counterrevolutionary understanding of the party, meaning the liquidation
of the real historical line of the constitution of the party, meaning the
out and out fetishisation of the formal aspect - the organisation as an
aim in itself, being constructed any time and any way, - inevitably bringing
about democratic, bureaucratic, followist practices,... at the expense
of the real movement, the invariant programme, the historical party.
<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">III- Formal "parties" and historical party</font></u></h2>
In addition to the question of separating movement and consciousness, class
and party, the Kautsky-Lenin tradition also obliterated the essential difference
Marx made between the party in its historical meaning and the multiple
groups, leagues... existing at one or another time, in one or another place:
the formal "parties".
<p>"Talking about the party, I give its historical meaning to this concept."
(Marx to Freiligrath - 1860)
<p>Marx, like Bordiga after him, (see "The substantial existence of the
party") always stresses forcefully the essential difference between on
the one hand the permanent historical tendency of the proletariat to constitute
itself into a party, to affirm itself as a conscious class, and on the
other hand the various materialisation, more or less clear, of such a tendency,
in time and in space. "The "League", like the "Society of Seasons" in Paris,
like a hundred other societies, weren't but one episode of this history
of the party, which spontaneously springs up from the soil of modern society"
(The letter of Marx to Freiligrath - 1860). In the same way, Marx and Engels
synthesised magnificently the communist programme in the famous manifesto
of 1847, which, even if it was "ordered" by a formal "party" - the "Communist
League" - has a validity, a contents that bypass this narrow framework
of the little communist militants' group to such an extent that today nobody
would ever dare to restrict the universal significance of the manifesto
to the simple programme of the League. The manifesto is a direct achievement
of the party "in its large historical acceptation".
<p>Moreover, the invariant line of the party being the line of the historical
party, its different formal expressions throughout the past have all been
more or less marked by their limits - limits of the non-integral restoration
of the revolutionary programme, because of the more or less important influence
of the bourgeois ideology - and so they have been not only ephemeral (see
Marx) but also contingent and limited. It is obvious that such a contingent
and limited character is entirely relating to the action of these "formal"
parties in history. The more they separate themselves in theory and practice
from the historical and invariant line of the communist programme, the
more their "limited and non-historical" characteristics are important,
the more their communist quality transforms itself, first sliding towards
centryism, and afterwards towards counterrevolution. As "Bilan" stated:
"Parties do not die, they betray".
<p>Inversely, the everlasting task of communist fractions and nuclei is
to represent the historical programme in the present. The more this central
task of theoretical and practical restoration is entirely assumed, the
more the historical party, in the immediate reality, takes a concrete form.
This is why the task of communist nuclei is not to constitute, to direct
a formal "party" but to be the central direction pole of the combating
party, the party that, in reality, organises armed insurrection and imposes
communism upon the whole world. The universal party that will impose the
definite victory of the proletariat is the historical party acting presently
as the centraliser, in time and in space, of the whole communist programme
(16). In this way, the historical line of the constitution of the party
always exists; only its various formal expressions, because of the counterrevolution
force, disappear or betray.
<p>"After the League was dissolved on my request, in November 1852, I never
belonged (nor do I now belong) to any secret or public organisation; so,
for me, the party, in this quite ephemeral meaning, has ceased to exist
for eight years already..." (Marx to Freiligrath)
<p>In a period of dominant counterrevolution, only the very small groups
and fractions that are firmly anchored to the historical programme can
manage to subsist, expressing the perenniality of the party line more or
less adequately, while being in the same time completely in opposition
to the whole immediate reality. The only compass is the invariant contents
of the programme. "It is the attachment to this being (the human being,
which is man's real "Gemeinwesen"), which is apparently denied during counter-revolution
periods, (just like today, when revolution seems utopian to most people),
that allows one to resist". (Origin and function of the party form - Invariance,
1968). It is in such dark times that communists, following Marx, declare
: "I've always neglected the proletariat's momentary opinion" (Marx - 1850).
This was not only the position of Marx, but also of Lenin in 1915 and of
the Italian fraction of the communist left in the thirties, which passionately
fought for the intransigent defence of the communist programme and against
any artificial foundation, on confused programmatical bases, of new parties,
which, consequently, would inevitably be bound to join the counterrevolution
(see the struggle of the "Bilan" fraction against the foundation of the
IVth Trotskyist International).
<p>In those most sombre periods of the workers' movement, the tasks of
the communist groups, nuclei and fractions do not vary either. Only the
relationship between those various tasks - theory, direct action, propaganda,
agitation, international centralisation, etc. - varies, and in view of
the extreme-weakness of these groups, it is the most central, the most
directly historical tasks that should come first. In the same way, in an
insurrectional period, although the whole of the tasks have to be maintained,
obviously it will be the tasks on which the military victory depends that
will then dominate. As Bordiga expressed it very clearly in his "Considerations
on the organic activity of the party when the general situation is historically
unfavourable": "So we claim all forms of activity that belong to a favourable
period, but only to the extent allowed for by the real balance of forces"
(1965). The real activity of the party, in its historical acceptation,
is to assume the whole of the tasks of always, while the relationship between
them is determined by our relative strength: the more the communist forces
are concentrated and powerful on a world scale, the more the whole of the
tasks will be reinforced on all levels of communist action. Only our capacity,
be it very limited, to assume this totality, to answer programatically
on all levels of the workers' struggle, will put us in the historical line
of the party. This everlasting struggle of communists is the only real
preparatory work to the "spontaneous" rise of the party. This way, to break
the entirety of activity, of the communist practice, under the pretext
of assuming one or another of those tasks "better" or "more thoroughly"
(be it the "theoretical",the "military" tasks or the "action in today's
struggles") means in fact to destroy the activity of the party in favour
of immediate results, in favour of one or another aspect that will consequently
become hypertrophied and as it degenerates rapidly into the activity in
itself, into the apology of this particular form having become privileged
compared with the totality, this task loses its communist character. Once
again, this means putting forward the contingent and limited aspects to
the detriment of the total aspect, the historical aspect.
<p>Unfortunately, today this is the case of a large majority of the weak
communist forces. As a matter of fact, the catastrophic course of the capitalist
crisis - the essential motor of the proletarian struggle - is only getting
worse from day to day; struggles, revolts break out more and more often
and radically, while the "communist forces" keep "discussing", "lingering
on", "playing"... and are unable to assume the tasks for which they were
made. Dispersion exists everywhere and under many forms.
<p>Some try to artificially compensate the real lack of programmatical
and organisational restoration through "old tactical solutions": they "go
to the masses", they drown themselves in the smallest local conflict in
order to find "the solution" to the crisis of the communist movement and
in the end they lose everything altogether, as well the programmatical
tasks as the tasks of action, agitation and propaganda within local struggles,
because it becomes clear that they cannot fulfil the tasks neither of the
struggle that is going on, nor of the potential future development of this
struggle. Activism has become the absolute master; in order to unite just
anybody on just any basis, one should agitate, "carry out opinion polls",
"sound the feelings of workers",... but, most of all, one should not at
any price consider the basic questions, the revolutionary programme, which
means abandoning the programme.
<p>Others, on the contrary, retrench themselves in the ivory tower of "theoretical
work" they consider as a preliminary separated from the rest of the tasks.
The pretext is no longer "to go to the masses", or "to know the workers",
but to solve all the programmatical questions before being able to take
a clear position on such or such event (17). Here also militant work, considered
as a whole in its real communist meanings is being destroyed. Communist
theory, as a matter of fact, can only draw its function and its force from
the bosom of the entirety of revolutionary praxis: "We cannot, however,
draw up a barrier between theory and practical action, because this would
mean, once certain limits are passed, to destroy ourselves as well as all
the bases of our principles" ("Considerations on the organic activity of
the party when the general situation is historically unfavourable").
<p>There are other deviations - militarism, propagandism, localism, sectarianism...
- and they can complete one another. But tthey all put forward one particular
form as being the solution, around which the "true party" should be constructed.
Once more, this means confounding between today's formalizations, which
are still essentially determined by immediate and therefore capitalistic
reality (a more or less important deviation of all today's groups), and
the historical tendency towards the constitution of the party that, through
its concrete form as a single world-wide force, the party of revolution
- full and complete existence of the histoorical party in the immediate
reality - will necessarily mean the destruction, the bursting of all old
forms, of all groups that claim being the party today, of all groups that
act as the "constructors of the party" but in fact have only constructed
some more or less fixed forms that will necessarily be bypassed and destroyed
by the revolutionary contents of the proletarian movement.
<p>The task of communist nuclei is not to "build parties" but on the contrary,
to act consciously and voluntarily in function of historical reality, in
order to prepare and to direct the rise of the party and in order to prepare
the militant and theoretical executives capable of directing it towards
the new community. When Marx clearly states that "our designation as representatives
of the proletarian party comes from nobody else but ourselves", he once
more neglects all "democratic representation", all electoral and "majority"
mystique, which is what all humanist and bourgeois philanthropists will
always blame him for. "Our only designation as representatives of the proletarian
party" comes from the programme we defend, from our intransigent defence
of the historical interests of the proletariat, even if this should mean,
as it means to most communists most of the time, standing at counter-current
of the dominating ideas, even amongst workers. So what defines the workers'
vanguard, the real direction of the movement, is neither the democratic
designation election, possibility to revoke... and other democratic libertarian
bullshit - nor the self-proclamation of being the direction, but the real
capacity to direct the movement towards communism. As Marx defines it in
the Manifesto, communists are not necessarily these who call themselves
"communists", "internationalists", "revo1utionaries", but those who, in
the reality of struggles, are "the most determined fraction", those who
"involve all the others", not towards an "ephemeral victory" but towards
"the interest of the whole of the movement", those who in each struggle
"put forward the interest shared by the whole proletariat, independently
from each nationality". Therefore it is in view of a real total practice
action, theory, propaganda, agitation... - that communists define themselves
and that they prove the validity of their conception of the world. It is
this real direction that is always determined, not by the "immediate success"
but by the revolutionary watchword: "abolition of wage-slavery" (Marx "Salary,
price and profit"), which will enable the movement to not always start
again its history, its weaknesses, its hesitations, its lack of decision,
to not always make the same mistakes, and which will enable the movement
to reappropriate its own past, and therefore its future. "Whoever commands
the past, commands the future" (G.Orwell - "1984").
<p>And if, as we see further on, we criticise the conceptions and practices
of the "constructors of parties", we always more firmly oppose to them
the necessity of the "construction", of the preliminary formation of the
executives, of the direction of the party as the indispensable organ to
the crystallisation of the universal party. It is only this conscious and
voluntary work, starting before the emergence of large movements, of constituting
a central nucleus assuming programmatical restoration to the best, as well
as world-wide centralisation of revolutionary forces, action in struggles
and propaganda..., that will allow, in the right time, i.e. in a revolution
period, to summon up the proletarian forces still dispersed into one force
directed by a single world-centre, the directing organ of the party. Such
preparatory work - like an old mole digging out the soil of society without
nearly anybody noticing - has to be reinforced, centralised, organised
constantly... so that the next revolution wave won't get lost but will
be able to do away with this old world. The central task of communists
is to work internationally for the constitution of a centre, of the direction
of tomorrow's party. Communists have no interests different from those
of the rest of the proletariat in struggle, they are only the vanguard,
the real direction of the struggle and they organise themselves consequently.
<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">IV- The "spontaneous" rise of the party</font></u></h2>
Another essential question in the Marxist theory of the party concerns
the process of its constitution. Its basic premise is that the fundamental
determinant of the class, and therefore of the party, is "the soil of modern
society": the capitalistic mode of production giving rise "spontaneously"
(Marx) to the tendency of the constitution as a party. This spontaneous
rise means in the same time the ineluctable appearance of the forces giving
birth to the party and the necessary crystallisation, centralisation of
these forces into a single organisation. This centralisation, which expresses
the passage of the party from its substantial form to its real and complete
existence, is only possible because of the preliminary formation of the
militant and theoretical executives of the communist minority, the only
one that can allow for all class-attacks to move forward in a communist
sense. This way we have clarified the spontaneous process of the rise of
the class-party, which, in the Marxist understanding, implies a preliminary
factor of preparation, organisation and direction of this "spontaneity",
a process that was synthesised by the communist left through the following
sentence: Just like revolution, the party cannot be created, but has to
be directed.
<p>"One does not create neither parties nor revolutions. Parties and revolutions
have to be directed by uniting all useful revolutionary experiments on
an international level, in order to assure the chance of victory of the
proletariat in this battle to the utmost, as this battle is the inevitable
outcome of the historical period we are living. It seems to us that this
must be the conclusion." (Party and class action -1921 - Rassegna Communista)
<p>This understanding liquidates as well spontaneism as Leninism, dilettante
queuism and activism of "constructors of parties".
<p>Indeed, for spontaneism, the class is directly, all of a sudden, revolutionary.
The preparatory work, theoretical and practical, of communist nuclei, the
indispensable organisation of this spontaneity, is denied. All what is
left to do, for communists, if they are still necessary, is to "comment"
class struggle, and to the most, to illuminate, to guide by their sole
ideas, the working class. More sophisticated forms of spontaneism do exist,
among which, the various councilist, democratic, culturalist, educational,
anti-substitutionist, libertarian (18), etc. variations. But at the same
time other forms of spontaneism exist, camouflaged behind the ultra-partyist
phrases and affirmations, which, beyond their formal affirmations about
the need for the party, can only conceive their activity either as being
exclusively propagandist (joining this way, through activism, propagandist
councillism), or exclusively "theoretical" without understanding how the
communist programme is a praxis, the undissociable unity of theory and
practice.
<p>On the other pole (as we have already seen), we can find the "Leninist"
theories, more or less derived from a reduced interpretation of "What is
to be done? ", of the "construction of the party" conceived as an addition
of "union-militancy" - reproducing unionism, be it in "official" unions
or in "open", "immediate" groups... - and "political militancy", with its
whole counterrevolutionary problematic of the minimum-programme, the transitory
demands, the "bridge to be established between class and party, between
movement and goal, which are this way considered as separate entities.
Of course, this conception denies the spontaneous rise of the party from
the soil of old society and opposes to it a whole plan of construction,
in reality a plan of individual recruitment of proletarians, which requires
the infiltration of all groups where one can find "sociological proletarians"
- unions, sport and cultural clubs, etc. -- in order to obtain, through
many manoeuvres, the direction of these organisations and to direct large
worker masses. But this direction is only possible at the cost of abandoning
the communist programme and adopting a bourgeois programme since the dominating
ideology is the one of the dominating class. When those militants manage
to get to the head of bourgeois organisations, this means their liquidation
at short term either as leaders or as communists. It always means the liquidation
of the party itself, of its programme, which, just like its militants,
gets dragged along an activist/opportunist spiral, transforming itself
rapidly into a single bourgeois, unionist practice. This process, which
has already dragged many groups into the bourgeois camp, is caricaturally
completed by a series of "supple tactics" (of compromission), all justified
for the sake of "realism" and "concretism" and based on Lenin's leaflet
"The infantile illness of communism: leftism", which has unfortunately
become famous. Those "tactics" include trickery as well as the meticulous
elaboration of all stages of the continuous claims that should unfailingly
drag proletarians to revolution. All these artificial constructions, these
various stages, these lists of transitory demands, besides the fact that
they try to model the movement according to their ideological schemes,
at best have no influence at all for they will be completely bypassed by
the generalised launching of the movement, and, at worst, they will be
real brakes to the struggle which does not proceed gradually but by qualitative
bonds and which, in order to advance, shouldn't fix itself any preliminary
limits, but, on the contrary, should tend to want everything, to take everything.
As we have already seen, it is the very contents of the movement that bypasses
all transitory stages invented by "constructors", which are, in most cases,
nothing but new obstacles to the struggle.
<p>From the basic premise, which determines the rise of the party from
the soil of modern society, we can derive the following: the party is being
directed centrally and directly on a world-wide level - organic centralism:
centralisation, in time and space -. Its full and entire existence therefore
can only be materially possible when there is an international wave of
class struggles like in l9l7-l923. In this sense, we can state that a real
and effective embodiment of the party, its world-wide existence (no longer
only as a tendency, no longer substantially) can only be possible when
there are powerful acting proletarian forces, which, for sure, to a large
extent are still unconscious of their movement when the period is a clear
period of revolution, of reversal of the balance of forces between the
bourgeoisie and the proletariat, and this can only be considered on a world-wide
level. In these circumstances, in the heat of the struggle, the many communist
nuclei, groups..., spread all over the world, which have most adequately
assumed the preparatory tasks, manage to unify, to centralise themselves
in order to effectively direct the world-wide communist revolution. The
party therefore does not proceed from a pure and single matrix, nor from
any particular geographical zone or from a single communist cell, but on
the contrary, it rises "spontaneously" from the flanks of our decaying
society, and the guarantee of its true revolutionary contents comes precisely
from the impersonal militancy of communist nuclei, which, at the right
moment, enables them to avoid making the same errors again and enables
them to direct the movement until definite victory. Identifying today's
communist nuclei with tomorrow's party, besides the megalomaniac character
of such identification, means misunderstanding the two fundamental aspects
of the existence of the party, which are its spontaneous rise and, preliminarily
to this rise, the indispensable maturation prepared by extreme minorities
among small communist groups, which, at decisive times, will be the only
ones capable of giving a full communist direction to the party. Understanding
this essential difference - quantitative and qualitative - between the
party of revolution and those groups which, in spite of all changes of
names or other vicissitudes, tirelessly prepare its rise, means being able
to work today at this central task of assuming, from now on, despite our
weak forces, all the tasks that will in a revolution period, determine
the proletarian victory.
<p>The exiled communist left of Italy ("Bilan" - "Prometeo") had already
perceived this reality when it defined, on the base of the fundamental
change of the balance of forces between capitalism and communism in the
thirties, the tasks of the fraction: to criticise past experiments always
more radically; to fight all falsifications more and more in order to restore
the communist programme while rejecting organisational voluntarism, activism,
artificial construction of the "Party", which, during this counter-revolution
period, can only serve the enemy (as was shown by the creation of the Trotskyist
"International"). In this sense, the non-activist direction of the fraction
(Vercesi, Pieri, Jacobs...) gave it the theoretical and practical capacity
(as it was one of the few groups in the world really able to do this) to
interpret and to intervene, from a proletarian point of view, against the
imperialist war launched in Spain to destroy the proletariat (1936-1939).
But a few years later, this position of "falling back", in a counter-revolution
period, on the most fundamental tasks, of refusing ephemeral success in
the "conquest of the masses" was defeated to the advantage of the voluntary
creation without principles of the "Party" in Italy around Damen in 1943-1945,
even though Vercesi just like Bordiga stuck on to a position of return
to the more fundamental task of programmatical restoration (which more
particularly provoked the 1952-scission).
<p>Through this historical experience, we can see how the capitulation
of communists before the difficulty of advancing at counter-current, to
the advantage of popularity and of immediacy, inevitably carries them away
onto the road of degeneration, of the liquidation of the programmatical
experiences of the workers' movement. Communists therefore, even in a revolution
period, will remain an extreme minority, even though they represent the
interests of the large majority of mankind, of the whole humanity; this
is not due to our own will, but because the balance of forces in favour
of the proletariat cannot be imposed durably but after the world-wide victory
of revolution, after a period of revolutionary dictatorship. Only through
the destruction of the universal bourgeois State, of wage-slavery and of
all its defenders - priests, bosses, trade-unionists, leftists... - the
communist party can become a "mass-party", the "party of humanity", the
new victorious community, the communist society. The communist party, even
while acting for the interests of humanity, while directing millions of
proletarians during the struggle and insurrection, will remain an extreme
minority of proletarians united by the programme defending the historical
interests of the proletariat and consequently the interests of the liberation
of mankind.
<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">V- The "way of life" of the party</font></u></h2>
The characteristics of tomorrow's party, of its "way of life" flow inevitably
from communism as the essential determination of the party.
<p>"Being understood that the party is the prefiguration of communist society,
it cannot adapt itself to some mechanism, some principle about life, about
organisation which in some way is linked to bourgeois society; the party
has to carry into effect its destruction." (Origin and function of the
party-form - Invariance No 1)
<p>This problem is not just a technical, a mechanical one, it concerns
the very life of the party because for communism there can be no antagonism,
for any reason whatsoever, between the "principles" (strategy) and the
"tactics", between programmatical affirmations and daily practice. "One
cannot mechanically separate the political and the organisational questions."
(Lenin - First congress of the CPR)
<p>A few years ago already, we had tried, by a brief statement of theses,
to synthesise the few existing programmatical experiences on this question
(mainly due to the communist left of Italy) while at the same time outlining
our own principles of behaviour. We have copied that document here because
it still expresses, in its main aspects, our orientation and this in perfect
accordance with the central theses of this text "Communism and Party".
<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">Organisation and organic centralism</font></u></h2>
1. The communist social movement exists and affirms itself for and as the
unification of the last exploited and revolutionary class in human pre-history:
the proletariat. The material base for this unification derives from the
universalisation of the production relationships, entirely achieved by
capitalism.
<p>2. But where we talk about a movement of unification and unifying (A),
this presupposes first of all a separation. Indeed, if the communist movement
is the unification/affirmation of the proletariat as a class for itself,
this movement is the anti-thesis of the capitalistic movement, which aims
at atomising all individuals (negation of classes) as "citizens" and consequently
at achieving the perfect separation/reification: democracy.
<p>3. Consequently, the proletariat's tendency to unite is fundamentally
anti-democratic and. totalitarian because it aims at solving the contradiction
between salaried work and capital by the dictatorship of the proletariat,
the dictatorship of the revolutionary and exploited class forced to always
act in the sense of the very negation of the bases of its domination (this
explains the dying away of classes and of the workers' state). This is
why "Communists do not have any codified constitutions to propose. They
have a world of lies and constitutions to destroy, crystallised in the
law and force of the dominant class. They know that only a revolutionary
and totalitarian mechanism of force and power, without excluding any means,
can possibly prevent the infamous residues of a barbarous epoch to rise
up again, and prevent the monster of social privilege, hungering after
revenge and servitude, from holding up its head again, launching once more
its treacherous cry of Liberty" (Bordiga - 1951).
<p>4. Marxism categorically rejects all anti-authoritarian, all democratic
and federalist conceptions, which in fact are nothing but the organisational
acceptance of the reality of capitalistic separations and of their ideologies.
As a matter of fact, those ideologies in practice are but the addition
(i.e. the acceptance) of all particularisms, of all localisms, of all corporatisms...
of all separations/categories of capital, the fetishism of decisions made
by a majority and consequently the political surrender to the dominating
ideas, which necessarily emanate from the dominating class. Here we reply
again, with Engels: "A revolution most certainly is the most authoritarian
thing possible, its is the act through which one part of the population
imposes its will on the other part by means of guns, bayonets and cannons,
which indeed are authoritarian means; and the victorious party, if it doesn't
want to lose the fruits of its struggle, has to maintain its power by the
fear those weapons inspire to reactionaries." (On Authority)
<p>5. Communism, therefore, as a social movement, is by essence (necessity)
centralist and organic because it tends to act as a class for itself, as
one and one only body - organism - united (i.e. passing dialectically beyond
the internal separations) through its historical interests. The communist
movement can only act as an organ - quite united and homogeneous - on the
condition of being strictly centralised. In this way, communist centralism
can only be organic. The movement has to centralise itself to be organic.
The centralisation of the movement is organic.
<p>6. This communist movement has existed ever since the existence of proletariat.
It materialises in time and space, particularly through the existence of
communist groups, fractions and parties, which are in the same time a product
of the tendency to the association of the worker movement - the tendency
to organic centralisation - and an agent, voluntary and conscious, of centralisation/unification
- organicity of the class. The programme oof communists, indeed, is nothing
but the synthesis of the aims and means of the historical movement taking
place under our eyes.
<p>7. The general laws that determine the communist movement also determine
the action and organisation of communist minorities. The party therefore
acts like a body and is centralised, it centralises itself in order to
act as a body; its internal system is organic centralism (B). "For us democracy
cannot be a principle; centralism on the contrary is undoubtfully one,
since the essential characteristics of the party organisation have to be
the unity of its structure and movement. The term of centralism is sufficient
to express the continuity in space of the structure of the party; and to
introduce the essential idea of the continuity in time, i.e. the continuity
of the aim we are tending to and of the direction we are going in spite
of the successive obstacles we have to surmount, and the more so, to link
into one formula these two essential ideas of unity, we would propose to
say that the communist party founds its organisation on "organic centralism"
(Bordiga - 1922).
<p>8. The foundation of the unitary action of the party is its programme.
The internal centralisation therefore can only be political (its corollary
being technical decentralisation, division of tasks). The function of the
political centre is to synthesise the whole of the organisational activity
and to direct this activity in perfect harmony with the programme. The
permanent link between the centre and the periphery is indispensable to
a dialectical functioning of the organisation, to synthesise all experiences,
all practices, of each "section", "commission", "cell", of each part of
the organisation, and in the same time, to direct these in an unitarian
and solid action. "One doesn't create neither parties, nor revolutions.
One directs parties and revolutions by unifying all useful revolutionary
experiences on an international scale, so as to assure to the utmost the
chances of victory for the proletariat in the battle that is the inevitable
outcome of the historical period we are living." (Bordiga - 1921)
<p>9. Once more, we have to refuse all democratism on principle, because
the question is not, for the "basis", to check from time to time the "summit",
nor for the latter to impose any orientation. There is no need for checking
the centre, because the centre hasn't got the power - delegation - to change
the programme - principles and tactics - of the organisation. The corollary
of this conception is the permanent and real development of consciousness
formation and information - of each militant so that he can be directly
and politically engaged with the whole of the organisational praxis. This
is how each militant answers for the general orientation of the organisation,
and how the latter guarantees the practice of each of its militants (C).
Consequently, in a communist organisation, the point can never be "to delegate"
one's power, nor therefore "to elect" the centre. As a matter of fact,
delegating means renouncing to the possibility of direct action, and the
so-called sovereignty of democratic law is nothing else but an abdication,
most often in favour of rascals" (Bordiga - 1951).
<p>10. The question of discipline and self-discipline has to be considered
in the same way; strict self-discipline is required as far as the application
of organisational orientations goes because the latter is in accordance
with the political programme, which constitutes the voluntary base of adhesion
for each militant. One can only call on discipline if there is political
agreement; if the latter doesn't exist any more, the call for discipline
is nothing else but a bureaucratic move in order to suppress political
disagreement (proceeding most of the time from minorities) and reveals
the incapacity of the organisation to solve the new problems raised by
class-struggle.
<p>11. Programmatically (see "the democratic principle") we know we have
to make a distinction between the democratic mechanism (decisions made
by a majority) and its fetishism (the majority by definition is right and
the minority is wrong). And if we have to use the mechanism of decision
by a majority technically (if another, more appropriate means existed,
we would have to use it immediately) it can only be by deliberately clearing
it from its democratic mystic ("one man, one vote", "democratic control",
elections, electoral campaigns...), the apanage of all bourgeois organism.
"The democratic criterion is for us, up to now, only a material and accidental
element in the construction of our internal organisation and in the formulation
of our party-statutes; it isn't its indispensable platform. This is why,
as far as we are concerned, we will not set up as a principle the well-known
organisational formula of "democratic centralism" (Bordiga - 1922).
<h3>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">Notes</font></u></h3>
(A) As Lukacs asserts it, the concept of unity ("unity of subject and object,
finite and infinite, being and thinking", etc.) has the disadvantage that
the terms object, subject, etc. express what they are beyond their unity.
They no longer mean what their expression states in their unity (History
and Class consciousness - 1922).
<p>(B) Obviously the internal regime of an organisation, even if it must
conform itself to its political principles, cannot be considered as a guarantee
"in itself" of its action and practice. "The party can be or not be adapted
to its task, which is to give an impulse to revolutionary action. In fact,
this question doesn't concern the party in general but the communist party,
which isn't guaranteed against thousands of dangers of degeneration and
dissolution; it isn't made equal to its task by its statutes nor by simple
measures of internal organisation but by positive characters that grow
in the same time as it grows itself because it takes part in the struggle
as an organism with an unitary orientation, which it owes to its own conception
of the historical process, to a fundamental programme contained in the
collective consciousness and to its discipline." (Bordiga - 1922)
<p>(C) Here we see how organic centralism is not unilateral (from periphery
to centre) but how it also requires that every militant should himself
be a centralising agent (contrarily to the Stalinian vision of the omnipotent
centre and the unconscious militants) to really be, at any time, "the arms
and the eyes" of the organisation. So, the corollary of the synthetic function
of the centre is the personal responsibilizing of each militant, his full
understanding of his praxis.
<p>Of course, such theses are only a rough shape yet of the practical understanding
of organic centralism. What we are definitely sure of, and this is essential,
is what we do not want. It is in the whole of the worker practice, inside
the general and universal development of the class struggle, that organic
centralism, organic (of the total) and organisational answer to the needs
of the proletarian struggle does and will affirm itself, doing away with
all the democratic rules and fetishes. There can be no party without organic
centralism. Organic centralisation - the class organicity - is the concentration
of all proletarian force and power. It is the organisation into one unique
party. This way, the historical line of constituting the party takes shape
around the centralisation in time and space into one living acting body.
This is what we call organic centralism.
<p>Following that reasoning it is obvious that, just like we reject both
Leninism and anti-Leninism, we do reject democratism (controls by militants,
elections and revocability of the leaders,...) as well as its bureaucratic
and militarist complement (prestige, congressism, functionarism, followism,
predominance of "technicians",...), both responding to the "democratic
centralism" formula. Such formula as its name points it, bears all disadvantages
in itself: democratic functioning (completed by "Bolshevisation", i.e.
the organisation, on the base of the professional and thus corporatist
cells) is one of the most perfect models of functioning for the bourgeoisie's
organisations. The bourgeoisie too needs a perfect adequation between its
programme, the programme of capital, and its way of functioning: democratic
mechanism. Such is the coherence of counterrevolution.
<p>From a historical point of view, democratic centralism was an attempt,
on the part of the Bolsheviks, to conciliate the necessary dictatorial
direction of the actions in order to be able to answer to the needs of
the struggle properly (in a general mood of clandestinity) with the dilettantist,
academic and tricky way of life of the social-democracy. This is what gave
birth to the anti-natural centralisation of worker actions - the programme
of communism - and democracy - the programme of capital -. But it turned
out to be practically inadequate and wrong because each time Lenin or Trotsky
made a class position triumph (see defeatism, the April theses, the Duma's
boycott, the insurrection preparation...) they did it strictly anti-democratically.
Lenin openly took no account of all internal democratic rules when he called
upon the vanguard militants and threatened the Bolshevik "party" of resigning.
On the contrary, each time the point was to confirm a bourgeois policy,
this was done with the great pomp of majority, in strict democratic legality
(see the IInd, IIIrd, IVth and Vth congresses of the "communist" International).
We could never repeat enough that Lenin's only "revolutionary parliamentarist"
practice was to have the constituent assembly dissolved with bayonet-thrusts.
We will also destroy parliament, even against the majority of workers'
opinion.
<p>Even if democratic centralism already was, in Lenin's days, an anti-natural
aberration, it quickly became, within the Stalinian, Trotskyist and even
councillist parties, the panacea when an irremovable direction wanted the
majority of the "uneducated" base to endorse any decision (except as it
is logical in case of inter- fraction settlements of account, when a part
of the "former" direction, chosen as scapegoat, is liquidated. See the
tragi-comical reversals of the Chinese and Russian "communist" parties...).
It is therefore most funny to notice that in all those so-called revolutionary
"parties", which function because of democratic centralism, any change
of orientation (sometimes even of 180<font face="Symbol">&deg;</font> )
will always be democratically endorsed, since those parties carry on their
bourgeois policy democratically. Once again, there is a class frontier
between communism and democracy. The way of life of our party can only
express our project, the human community, tendentially. But we can by no
means tolerate or emphasise practices, attitudes, functioning... in contradiction
with our programme. On the contrary, we have to destroy them, as we act
to destroy the old world.

<font face="Comic Sans MS">oOo</font></h2></center>
We have tried, through this contribution to the "big" question of the party,
to redefine some basic concepts of the Marxist theory - destruction of
all ideologies - in the only outlook of communism, of re-unifying the species.
Acting for this reunification cannot be conceived but as a whole, as a
one and only movement of unification destroying all the mediations imposed
by the old world. There aren't several revolutionary movements, parties,
orientations... to be chosen according to "free thinking": there is only
one revolutionary movement, one party, one orientation, one direction that
establishes the truth, from the proletarian point of view, by its own practice,
by the setting up of the proletariat's dictatorship -obviously the dictatorship
of the party - aiming at abolishing salaried work, as a transition to the
new community, to full communism. This is why the "true" world communist
party is the one that will lead us to definitive victory, and not the chimerical
reproduction of past forms, of unfailing pseudo-recipes : the ideal party
hovering in the Leninists' heads and in the heads of their enemy brothers:
the anti-Leninists.
<p>"The class lives, fights, advances and triumphs through the working
of the forces it has engendered in the pains of history. The class starts
from an immediate homogeneity of the economic situation, which seems to
us to be the first motor of the tendency to go beyond, to break the present
production system. But to assume such a great task, it must have not only
its own thinking, but also the proper will to reach the purposes defined
by research and criticism and also its own organisation of fight that canalises
and uses the efforts and sacrifices most efficiently. All this makes up
the party." (Bordiga - "Class party" - 1921) (underlined by us)

<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">Notes</font></u></h3>
(1) Namely in "Class and party" - "Rupture with the ICC" (Brochure of the
ICG); "Presentation" (Le Communiste No 6); "Contribution to the grouping
of revolutionaries" (Le Communiste No 7).
<p>(2) In the whole of the democratic-managerist currents, no doubt, the
councillist current is the one that has most openly repudiated the Marxist
understanding of the proletariat's organisation into a party (see namely
the ICC brochure "Communist organisations and class consciousness" and
the more recent text "Beyond the party" of the Junius Group, edited by
Spartacus).
<p>(3) We are here taking into account the "hard" Leninist conceptions
of the "party", built stone by stone on the base of the use of "supple
tactics" and not the more populist Leninist currents, whose conceptions
of the mass "party" and of the unique front, are but the exact - not even
radicalised - reproduction of the social-democratic parties. So, we mean
the conception expressed in "What is to be done?" when we criticise the
Leninist conception of the party, and not what the epigones of "Leninism"
have done with it.
<p>(4) About this question, please see our text: "<a href="c6_alienation.htm">From
man's alienation to human community</a>" in "Le Communiste No 14.
<p>(5) When we use the term "social" (social movement, social project,
social revolution...), it is by no means to follow the temporary fashion
of the small European extreme-left, but to signify the totality of our
movement, our project and our revolution represent, which can never be
identified with one of its aspects: economic, philosophical, political,
military... (One could use the term "political" in the same totalizing
and totalitarian contents, if that term was not commonly interpreted in
the sense of the simple superstructural representation of the government).
<p>(6) Marx, even if the formalists don't agree with this, opposed the
whole of the party of anarchy to the party of order (see the social class
struggles in France): "However varied the socialism of the big fractions
of the party of anarchy were, they agreed on one point: to claim that socialism
is the means of emancipation for the proletariat and that the emancipation
of the proletariat is its aim."
<p>(7) All vulgar materialists don't go beyond the sociological or even
strictly economic definition of the working class, which inevitably drags
them onto the bourgeoisie's ground and makes them consider the proletariat
as the exploited class that reproduces capital and not as a revolutionary
class.
<p>(8) In the same way, within the capitalistic mode of production, the
form - value of exchange - necessarily proceeds from the substance of the
value: abstract work (see the Capital).
<p>(9) The proletariat's extreme situation as a "non-class" is that of
its only existing "for capital", its complete atomisation, its dissolution
within the people. The full domination of counter-revolution within purified
democracy - fascist or antifascist - almost completely succeeded in achieving
that state of class denying during the period before the 2nd world war
(see "Bilan").
<p>"As to us, we shall use the concept "non-class", rather than the "more
classical" "class for itself" in order to better indicate that the difference
between "class in itself" and "class for itself" expresses on one hand
the inexistence of the proletariat as a revolutionary class and on the
other hand its affirmation as such." (Le Communiste No 14).
<p>(10) Historical materialism does not rely on simple and immediate reality
- the place of one and another individual  or group of individuals in bourgeois
society - to deduce its social project, its political programme mechanically.
The caricature of this vulgar process is workerism, for which everything
depends on the work done by each individual to determine his "individual"
nature of class! On the contrary, historical materialism relies on the
material and historical reality of the whole "arch" of history - from primitive
community to communism - to claim that from a historical point of view,
a human collectivity, the proletariat, a class exploited in the capitalistic
mode of production, is the revolutionary class that will impose communism
on humanity and will free it from reigning need. (See our text "Some criticisms
on dialectical materialism" in Le Communiste No 13)
<p>(11) We consider "State and Revolution", the various texts "Against
the stream" explaining the defeatist revolutionary positions, and: "What
is to be done?" (not reduced to the simple questions of "setting up the
party" and "external consciousness" but expressing the necessity of the
struggling party) as Lenin's most important attempts to break with the
bourgeoisie by restoring the communist programme partly.
<p>On the other hand, in our text "Some lessons from October" (in Le Communiste
No 10/11) we had largely explained how Lenin himself had to change the
whole programme of his "party" (see the April theses) while desperately
fighting against all executives and "old bolsheviks" (Zinoviev, Kamenev,
Stalin...) who were by no means different from the Mensheviks. As J.Barrot
says "Russian revolution took place contrary to the ideas expressed in
"What is to be done?" (The "renegade" Kautsky and his disciple Lenin)
<p>(12) This wrong and dichotomic conception that separates "immediate"
and "historical" struggles did even appear in some of our texts. For us
also, it materialises a lack of rupture with the old Leninist and/or councillist
conceptions.
<p>(13) We shall not here develop the complex question of the late creation
(in 1919) and of the extremely rapid involution of the IIIrd International.
We would simply like to say that if this creation definitely materialises
a class attempt, the direction that has been followed since the very beginning
of its existence (Moscow's executive headed by Zinoviev) very early lead
the C.I. to give up the communist programme (see the elimination of the
"leftist" executives between the Ist and IInd congresses, the setting up
of the 21 conditions, the exclusion of the KAPD, the frontism, the inter-classist
alliances, among which the "national-bolshevism"... "socialism in one only
country",...).
<p>(14) Namely the multiple groups that had a defeatist position during
the first world war and organised themselves before the creation of the
C.I. See the abstentionist fraction of the Italian S.P., the IKD in Germany;
the C.P. of Van Overstraeten in Belgium; the communist FORA in Argentina/Chile...
the Pericat-group in France; the C.P. of S.Pankhurst; the Indian C.P.;
the IWW and SLP in the USA; the Dutch C.P...
<p>(15) We give this example although we know how delicate it is to exemplify
a social process by physiological functioning. Of this example we only
want to keep the dialectical image that expresses a non-separate and non-identical
reality.
<p>(16) This disqualifies, from now on, all "parties" that, in non-revolutionary
days, claim to be the "parties of revolution" while one of the bases of
the Marxist understanding of the rise of the party is precisely that the
latter should not "proclaim itself" at any time but should crystallise
and centralise, on a world scale directly, the reality of the communist
forces directing the revolutionary wave.
<p>(17) This is, among others, the case of the "Communism or civilisation"
group, which is busy publishing and planifying questions, and postpones
its actions "to transform the world" to many decades. What we are criticising
is not the fact of undertaking such a work but (in addition to some of
their positions) the fact of undertaking ONLY that work.
<p>(18) They all share the pathological bourgeois fear of "violating" the
purity of the class (as understood, of course, in the most economist sense).
