To stand by the side of the insurgents in Kronstadt doesn't have anything
to do with to be devoted to the cult of Kronstadt and the workers who made
the Capital pay a high price for their skin; those who fell into this trap
barely succeeded in strengthening the work of the counterrevolution while
erecting one more mausoleum before which one makes proletarians kneel.
<p>The prominent character of the revolutionary events in Kronstadt as
well as in October 1917 doesn't lie in their immediate results (either
defeat or victory), but in the impact that they had on the international
revolutionary movement, in the role that they played towards the extension/resorption
of the world revolution. In spite of thousands of kilometers that separated
the revolutionary struggles in 1917-21 (partially victorious in some places
and partially defeated elsewhere), and despite the intervals in time in
the various revolutionary thrusts, it is the rising everywhere in the world
of communist organizations tempting to put in common their experiences
of struggles, that put a mark on the big revolutionary battles of this
time. These organizations tempted, thanks to a work of international centralization,
to develop/reinforce the communist program handed down by revolutionaries
of the past, that years of social-democrat practice (marxist as well as
libertarian) had nearly eliminated as material force. In a few months,
a movement that was confined to some "left communist" and "anarchist" circles
and sects expanded up to threaten the world State of capitalism, thanks
to the revolutionary attempt of centralization realized while creating
the IIIrd International.
<p>To place Kronstadt in the totality of the revolutionary movement where
October 1917 is the starting point, this is the class rupture imposed by
the insurgents, that we entirely claim. Our understanding has nothing to
do with the scientific analysis, the impartial description from historic
commentators (from historiographers) who reduce the historic reality to
definitively concluded events, isolated from any historic perspective where
we get involved. These historians describe the social struggles idea through
individuals directly in contention, without showing that the struggles
of the proletariat through the time are the products of world class antagonisms
and not of the will, the courage of such or such individuals.
<p>The class rupture proclaimed by the insurgents themselves pushes aside
all the thurifiers of Kronstadt who concealed the inseparable revolutionary
content of Kronstadt and October 1917. But for the bourgeois common sense,
the same "individuals" cannot take sides once with the revolution and another
time with the reaction, "revolution" having no other meaning but to celebrate
this bourgeois individual in his new citizen's suit. On the contrary, the
common essence of Kronstadt 1921 and October 1917, defines the communist
revolution not as the work of brilliant individuals, but as a social upheavals
process taking place and exacerbating itself under the thrusts of class
contradictions, until the resolution of the contradiction of class societies
into Communism. It is an idealist withdrawal on himself to understand the
insurrection in Kronstadt as "the pure explosion of liberty", as well as
to image October 1917 in Russia as "the great evening" where the world
would have been upset overnight by the institution of the dictatorship
of the proletariat. To put things like that, as it would seem to be necessary
to polarize them while excluding them, this means to confine the revolutionary
movement to a succession of events isolated the ones and the others, good
or bad, victorious or defeated, that follow a progressive plan where the
movement takes place in a regular and linear way, either in a revolutionary
or in a counterrevolutionary course. In the reality, the revolutionary
movement advances on the contrary by springing. Facing the pressure of
the counterrevolution and facing the social antagonisms exacerbation that
follows, the proletariat is obliged to make the criticism of the past struggles,
in order to succeed in defining better its strategy, in correcting its
weaknesses. The class constitutes itself as a Party through the century-old
struggles that the communists examine closely and critically, in order
to no more reproduce the defeats of the past. The universality of the capitalistic
State, of the commodity and its unceasing metamorphoses determines the
communists to push this criticism of the revolutionary movement until the
universal resolution of classes contradictions. For the communists who
constitute the revolutionary vanguard, there doesn't therefore exist any
victory that cannot turns into a defeat and <i>vice versa</i>. There is
no place where the capital has been abolished and that would constitute
a "red" sanctuary, without the destruction of the world State of the Capital
thanks to the victory of the international revolution. There is no antagonism
between a partial struggle and the historic goal, because although the
revolutionary movement necessarily appears as partial, every affirmation
really contains and sets out the development of the international centralization,
the world interests of the proletarian class. The revolutionary movement,
destructive of the society, is necessarily based on ruptures (rupture of
the proletarians in Kronstadt with the so-called "Workers' State in Russia")
and these express themselves by the self-criticism of the revolutionary
movement. The criticism thus becomes itself material force, integral part
of the revolutionary action of the proletariat.
<p>The radical criticism made by the insurgents in Kronstadt of the so-called
"Worker's State in Russia" agrees with and reinforces all the practical/critical
action of the left communists who formed, in spite of their weaknesses,
the vanguard of the revolutionary movement in 1917-21. But the defeat of
the rebellion in Kronstadt as well as the left communists' one in the CI
doesn't mean the funeral of the revolution. The no-abdication of the insurgents
in Kronstadt, who didn't disown the world revolution even when the bourgeoisie
managed to strike it decisively, is organically connected with a practice
of Party, with the revolutionary Party whose representatives are excluded
from the CI at the same time (June 1921) for also not having disowned the
international revolution and for having tempted to constitute a communist
direction to the class movement. An organization as the KAPD fully found
itself with the insurgents in Kronstadt because of its struggle of fraction
within the CI against the majority social-democrat tendencies and the bourgeois
positions adopted by the "communist" parties in favor of parliamentarianism
and trade-unionism... and especially because of its active and leading
role in the workers' struggles in March 1921 in Germany. In the same way,
some groups of the internationalist communist left such as the Italian
Fraction around the review "Bilan" and the Belgian Fraction which, leaning
on a critical work of the revolutionary movement, defended the revolutionary
interests of the proletarians in Spain in 1936 and 1937, against the repression
of the "antifascist republican front and its anarchist ministers", identical
repression in its bourgeois nature with the one of bolshevik government
against Kronstadt. These communists didn't cling to communism as to a dogma
while doing a new religion of it, with its bible and its saints; their
practical/critical attitude faithful to the revolutionary movement of the
proletariat didn't have as objective to acquire a place as guard of "the
Marxist orthodoxy", as well as the insurgents in Kronstadt didn't made
of October 1917 a sacred monument, but they set up the foundations for
a clarification and a development of the historic program of the revolution,
thanks to their essential criticism of the movement, certainly not entirely
elaborated.
<p>Only the action of the communists, drawing lessons from the revolutionary
experiences of the proletariat, allowed that Kronstadt is nowadays useful
for the world proletariat as reference as well as October 1917, Berlin
1918-19, Barcelona 1937, etc. Without this militant work of left communism
groups, we would still flounder in the social-democrat swamp where October
1917 is confused with any kind of accession of the left to the government
and where the workers' struggles in Kronstadt are useful as leitmotif for
the setting up of anarchist ministries, as in 1936 in Spain.
<p>Kronstadt illustrates how the communist movement, thanks to the revolutionary
criticism that the class contradictions depth obliges it to incessantly
lead, manages to reemerge from the most biting defeat and to regenerate
itself until the moment of a new decisive confrontation. The revolutionary
movement indeed draws its strength from its defeats, thanks to the militant
work of its communist fractions which draw the lessons of the struggles,
against the current, and make them rise again, after a long and difficult
way, more compact, more sharp and powerful.
