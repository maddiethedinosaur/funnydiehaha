<h2>
<u><font face="Tahoma">1. Introduction</font></u></h2>
<font face="Tahoma">The events that took place during the months of April,
May, and June 1989 were altogether the expression of the struggle of the
proletariat against the misery of its living conditions, and not only “the
struggle of students for more freedom and democracy”, as the dominant ideology
wants to impose us. It is nevertheless clear that the revolt which emerged
in China straightaway expressed –from its arising till its temporary destruction
by the bloody repression- important weaknesses.</font>
<p><font face="Tahoma">Proletarians expressed violently across all China
their discontent against their living conditions and this by means of demonstrations,
strikes, sabotages, expropriation of food in stores, attempts of arming
and fraternizations with soldiers. But the lack of autonomous organization
of proletarians and the fact that there was no communist perspective given
to the struggle, brought back the organization of this revolt too often
under the various flags set and hung by the bourgeoisie of China and from
all over the world: i.e. the struggle for their sacrosanct democracy, the
struggle against the excesses and other dysfunctions of the regime. The
fact that the proletarians themselves carried and reproduced these bourgeois
flags, expresses above all the weakness of a class that doesn’t manage
to get autonomous, to defend its own class interests, and that is from
then on defending and supporting the most radical fraction of the bourgeoisie,
“more leftist”, and “reformist”.</font>
<p><font face="Tahoma">Continually in these confrontations, the opposition
was therefore between:</font>
<br><font face="Tahoma">* on one hand, the non-organized, and therefore
defeated, interests of the proletariat,</font>
<br><font face="Tahoma">* and on the other hand, resistance and direct
repression of the bourgeoisie, which were fully made easier through its
enemy’s weaknesses in the struggle.</font>
<p><font face="Tahoma">China, as a country producing and reproducing the
capitalist system, is in crisis, for the same reason than all the other
countries of the world (with peculiar specificities and intensity for each
of them according to the characteristics of the country: e.g. its geography,
history, economy, social issues etc.). The state in China and its spokesman
Deng Xiao Ping have been forced to face this situation through reforms,
as everywhere else in the world. These reforms, which started ten years
ago, have been led in the framework of a campaign for the “four modernizations”
connected to the one of the alleged “opening upon the outside world”, as
if the state in China had ever been closed to take part to the development
of the world capitalist market. Reforms in China touched the sectors of
industry, agriculture, science, research and the army, modifying thus really
a series of secondary characteristics of the “Socialist China”. Everywhere
the bourgeoisie presents these reforms as “revolutionary” ones, as a guarantee
of the change from top to bottom of the old “Communist” system. But if
the bourgeoisie presents these reforms in such a spectacular way, it’s
really because it’s not about fundamental transformations, whose objective
would be other than the eternal race to profit.</font>
<p><font face="Tahoma">These reforms did only damage proletarians’ living
conditions of the whole continent by the increased organization of the
exploitation system. The first wave of reforms transformed the organizational
forms of agricultural production: i.e. the old structures of “collectivisation”
–the old Mao’s “communes”- that assured the illusion of full employment
(with of course many unemployed) in the countryside and a great mobility
of the labour force, while guaranteeing a simple and efficient control
on the agricultural proletariat. These old structures have been extensively
eliminated and replaced by “domestic agricultural systems of production”,
more productive. These new forms of organization can be defined by a more
decentralized but more coercive structure of the organization of agricultural
production. An administrative framework (which, among others measures,
set the prices) indirectly assured the control of the state, and the task
that consists in constantly increasing the pressure on work passed from
the hands of “communes” managers to those of “domestic farms” managers.</font>
<p><font face="Tahoma">Since then, the myth of “full employment” in the
countryside, so much praised previously by the Chinese state, collapsed
facing the cruel reality: 50 millions of proletarians left their village
and lived as vagabonds on the roads in countryside, or as “squatters” (illegal
immigrants) in the slums of cities. And even for the luckier families that
had higher incomes this increase of wage was and remained extensively neutralized
by the inflation.</font>
<p><font face="Tahoma">During this time the official propaganda and the
world media popularised the Chinese agricultural reforms, describing them
as the history of a dazzling success. The world media especially underlined
the existence and multiplication of “rich peasants”. The reality was that,
in most cases, some families of peasants succeeded at the cost of disproportionate
efforts in buying some means of production, as trucks. It allowed them
to get some sufficient incomes to guarantee the dynamics of their own exploitation.
In other situations, a certain number of “domestic farms” that “succeeded”
took directly refuge in speculation or in activities of industrial “small
capitalism” or even in business.</font>
<p><font face="Tahoma">In spite of the bourgeois international publicity
(either favourable or unfavourable) around the old system “to each his
iron bowl of rice”, the wave of egalitarian distribution never existed
in China: the difference –and thus the competition- between proletarians
has always been encouraged by sophisticated methods of alleged “advantages”,
such as the renting of material to individuals, or to families, etc. For
the whole of the agricultural proletariat in China, anyway, the process
of reforms led to the exacerbation of their problems: i.e. lesser job security,
decrease of wages, and more pressure on hard work. In one word, reforms
meant for proletarians a real and efficient “modernization” and this in
the most terrorist sense of the word. The situation of proletarians got
worse to such a point that revolts have been led in several places in the
name of the return to the archaic system of the Mao-like “communes”, considered
as less oppressive than the “modern system of domestic agriculture”.</font>
<p><font face="Tahoma">The industrial restructuring began much later, but
led to the same results. The urban unemployment already existed before
in China, and became a large-scale phenomenon because of the rationalization
of the production in numerous enterprises. The emigration from countryside
also played a role: e.g. in the province of Sichuan the population of the
capital city, Shengdu, increased of 3.8 millions, and the number of unemployed
of one million.</font>
<p><font face="Tahoma">Operations of foreign investment were much more
limited than what was suggested by the propaganda. Anyway, agreements (joint
ventures) and foreign companies played an important role in sharpening
the contradictions and social tensions, the same way the multiplication
of commercial agreements on an international scale (the famous “opening
upon the outside world”) has made the contradictory nature of “modernization”
much more visible.</font>
<p><font face="Tahoma">As for the competitiveness of Chinese products on
the world market, it is mainly provided by the extremely low wages. In
some years, the real wages in urban China decreased of 40%, and without
speaking about the relative wage decrease.</font>
<p><font face="Tahoma">With regard to the modernization of education and
sciences, the pressure for the competition became quite intolerable in
high schools and universities. Work perspectives for the students are bad;
alone children of the bourgeoisie can hope to expect a lucrative work after
having finished their studies. In the same time, students’ living conditions
became worse than ever: overcrowded schools and boarding schools, disgusting
food, etc. We can already see here how the determinations in the struggle
of studying proletarians didn’t have for origin the simple “desire of democracy”.</font>
<p><font face="Tahoma">The same observations can be made about the army
that concentrated a big number (3 millions) of proletarians. Except for
the elite troops, soldiers of the “Liberation Popular Army” generally have
the same –in not lower- average standard of living than workers of the
cities and countryside: their 50 Yuan –or even lesser- wage per month was
not enough to pay food expenses. The military draft is obligatory in China.</font>
<p><font face="Tahoma">The general restructuring of management capitalist
methods in China led to a widening of corruption (i.e. essentially that
it became more and more visible). The bourgeois propaganda has the tendency
to confuse anyway two completely different phenomena: on one hand, the
efforts of proletarians cornered and criminalized by their intolerable
living conditions and who try to survive while smuggling, stealing or robbing
(especially young proletarians in the cities), and on another hand, the
financial wheeling and dealing of bourgeois who exploit new (but partial)
possibilities for making profit from the speculation on a big scale, as
well as those of the individual small capitalists in close collaboration
with managers of the state and the party.</font>
<p><font face="Tahoma">Campaigns against “corruption” were thus useful
for hiding the fact that it’s the capitalist system itself that provokes
the chaos of crisis and the unbearable living conditions the majority of
humankind are submitted to. Moreover, jailing some small capitalists justifies
the general repression against the necessarily illegal attempts of proletarians
who, faced with misery, don’t have any other solutions than to try to snatch
by force what the state defends in its stores, its properties, its factories,
etc.</font>
<p><font face="Tahoma">At the same time, it would be silly to see the capitalist
changes and developments in China only during the last decade. The new
poles of capitalist concentration caught up with the old ones: many factories
have been built and, in the framework of “the opening upon the outside
world”, even the structures of consumption began to change. But all these
developments and transformations combined with a deep crisis phenomenon
only drove to an exacerbation of the contradictions: the continuation of
the industrialization on a big scale concentrated bigger and bigger masses
of proletarians in the cities, with terrible housing conditions and miserable
wages. The bigger choice of consumption goods (for example, the wide range
of clothes, televisions, and even videos, etc.), which made the foreign
visitors enthusiastic about the “radical Chinese reforms”, only resulted
in an increase of local proletarians’ fear, unable to buy anything, with
the exception of a little bit of food, some square meters to rent for sleeping,
and a bicycle to go working; with the exception therefore of the minimum
needed for the reproduction of their labour force.</font>
<p><font face="Tahoma">Reforms of the production apparatus were necessary
in China, so that the local capitalists remain competitive on the market.
The Maoist illusion collapsed. A mass of humans armed with small spoons
to exploit rice fields, will never replace the capitalist necessity to
constantly renew its means of production to remain competitive on the world
market. Capital is the only and real master and demonstrated it once again
here, while submitting to its laws all those who pretended to manage its
economy. Consequences of the reforms in China violently fell on proletarians
and it’s in this context that the first workers’ reactions appeared.</font>
<h2>
<u><font face="Tahoma">2. The struggles: forces and weaknesses of the movement</font></u></h2>
<font face="Tahoma">It’s in this atmosphere of crisis and in the very context
of reforms launched by Deng Xiao Ping, that since early April discontent
demonstrations appeared in the cities and countryside. Indeed, since the
month of April in Xian (capital of the province of Shaanxi) thousands of
“rioters” (as the “China Daily” wrote) attacked the local committee of
the CCP, set fire to it –and to several cars, trucks and some other buildings
too - and clashed with armed units of the police. Hundred and thirty armed
policemen and some members of the public security were injured, and the
authorities arrested many “thieves”.</font>
<p><font face="Tahoma">In Changsha (capital of the province of Hunan),
“rioters and looters” swept into the city on April 22nd. Youngsters, mostly
unemployed, smashed luxury stores, set cars on fire, assaulted restaurants.
At the same time in Argentina and in West Germany the same looting and
confrontations against the cops took place, against runaway misery and
pauperisation.</font>
<p><font face="Tahoma">Trains and stores were looted in several cities
of the country. A few later, proletarians erected barricades in Shanghai,
and paralysed the entire public transportation network. In other cities
attacks were led against buildings of the party and the government, against
warehouses, trains, shopping malls, etc.</font>
<p><font face="Tahoma">As we can see, it’s about a very general struggle,
determined by a miserabilization of all sectors of the proletariat, and
led therefore also by the whole of the working class “categories”.</font>
<p><font face="Tahoma">We insist on this point because the international
media tried to restrict the events in China to a pacifist struggle of the
only “students”. Tian An Men Square was under the glare of bourgeois information
spotlight, in order to cast a bourgeois light on the struggles that took
place in all China –and also on Tian An Men Square-, to provide a very
“responsible” version about the events, insisting on the disgusting flags
and demands of the “students’ coordination”, this embryo of a new government,
still in the opposition.</font>
<p><font face="Tahoma">There was a clear function to fulfil while underlining
in such a spectacular way the reformist and democratic purposes the students’
leaders tried to impose –and they on a whole succeeded in imposing- on
Tian An Men Square. The bourgeois ideology aims to hide the common foundation
of regular explosions of anger that shake the world these last years and
this is how the media transforms struggling proletarians in the world into
“students” in China and in Burma, into “shanty towns inhabitants” in Latin
America, into “nationalists” in USSR, into “opposition democrats” in Eastern
Europe, into "Moslem brothers” in Syria, into “young unemployed” in Algeria,
etc. The class that is taking a real hammering on the crisis is thus buried
in an ocean of flags and confused categories that prevents it from recognizing
the common situation that unites it everywhere, that prevents it more widely
from recognizing its class brothers and sisters in the explosions of workers’
anger, which follow each other.</font>
<p><font face="Tahoma">The spectacle of the world, given by the bourgeois
disinformation channels, appears in the eyes of the proletarians like an
incomprehensible chaos, where each category (national, professional, sectional,
etc. ones) in which the bourgeoisie trapped them, is completely distinct
from the next category.</font>
<p><font face="Tahoma">The young proletarians’ combativeness in Beijing,
because it was too easily contained by the “students’ coordination” and
its reformist flags, was not sufficient to affirm the indispensable link
with the proletarians who first started the struggle in other regions of
China. It’s on this basis that the bourgeoisie developed a report of the
events in China, while insisting on the strictly “student” character of
the movement, its will to change democratically the existing system of
management. And as a result, these events didn’t have anything anymore
to do with what happened in the rest of China.</font>
<p><font face="Tahoma">Another important element to emphasize is the framework
in which movements of struggle started. In China, as everywhere else, the
bourgeoisie was forced to apply some drastic reforms in order to try to
counter the more and more real decrease in its profit rate and to restructure
its production apparatus (as we developed in the first chapter). Never
mind these reforms were called “perestroika” in USSR, “modernization” in
China, “spring, summer plan” in Latin America or “restructuring” in Europe,
they had all of them a common essence attached to the world capitalist
necessity to compensate the fall of capitalist profit rates by a cut in
the social wage of the working class. These reforms are terrorizing for
the proletariat and are accompanied by powerful ideological campaigns aiming
to make it accepting the incredible deterioration of its living conditions.</font>
<p><font face="Tahoma">Faced with the spectacle subsequently given by the
world media as for the reformist purposes the movement pursued, the matter
is therefore about recalling that the struggles initially started following
and against the reforms opened some ten years earlier by Deng Xiao Ping,
reforms which were greeted, all along their setting up, by the whole of
the world bourgeoisie.</font>
<p><font face="Tahoma">The fact that in Beijing the struggles engulfed
themselves gradually in the thoughts of political reforms carried by the
“students’ coordination” obviously and complementarily served the bourgeoisie
to suddenly put forward the fact that Deng Xiao Ping’s reforms didn’t go
far enough and give again a perspective of a “more radical” reform, a “political”
one. The flag of the “political reform” served thus as standard to “make
forget” that the origin of the movement was rooted in the opposition to
the reforms, because this opposition concealed in itself the truth according
to which no reform of the capitalist system will never improve the fate
of the working class!!!</font>
<p><font face="Tahoma">The death of Hu Yaobang, one of the CCP “reformists”
who fell into disgrace, was then nothing but one pretext more to increase
in scale the agitation that developed in Beijing and culminated in demonstrations
of 100,000 people. It’s from this moment that China became to be under
the glare of the international media spotlight, drawing attention on the
responsibility and the will of pacific change of the “students”, hiding
the movements that had taken place in the provinces and that were at the
origin of the agitation against the reforms, transforming the local struggles
against the reforms into a kill of “communism” and into a hymn to free
enterprise and free market.</font>
<p><font face="Tahoma">April 27th a big demonstration took place: nearly
400,000 people marched while shouting… “Long live the communist party”!!!
What a terrible illusion to believe that it’s possible to confront the
state in China while finding the support of its structures. All along the
struggles
in Beijing, the proletarians deluded themselves with democratic watchwords
issued by the members of the “students’ coordination” who quickly became
to be candidates for governing. This is how in Shanghai 6,000 students
of the university of Fudan brought to the local authorities a petition
for democracy.</font>
<p><font face="Tahoma">As we emphasized above, the media continuously exemplified
the expression of this real submission of the proletarians to the democratic
watchwords and never gave publicity to the violent attacks of proletarians,
students groups and others, against the party and state buildings in big
cities like Shanghai, etc.</font>
<p><font face="Tahoma">May 8th, the ten thousands students of Beijing started
the strike again. The students’ representatives group for dialogue, newly
constituted, launched to the power a new call to negotiation.</font>
<p><font face="Tahoma">May 15th, Mikhail Gorbachev arrived in China. World
symbol of democratisation, ideal personification of economic, social and
political adjustment of the capitalist system, Gorbachev came to greet
the reforms started by Deng Xiao Ping. It’s nothing but the meeting of
two accomplices who both of them took since a certain time the necessary
measures for the modernization of exploitation, only fearing in return
an angry response from a proletariat put under pressure from all sides.
Even such a so big symbol like Gorbachev didn’t have anything to teach
to the representative of the bourgeois state in China because this one
already demonstrated practically since several years his big capacity to
reform the anomalies or the deviations of a productive system, which was
behind the world necessities for increasing its profit.</font>
<p><font face="Tahoma">On this occasion the Chinese government announced
the opening towards what he revelled in calling the “students’ protest”.
The Prime Minister Li Peng acknowledged that the students have the right
to demonstrate and the leader of the Party, Zhao Ziyang, asked the hunger
striking students to stop their movement, promising in exchange that the
government won’t take any retaliatory measure against the students and
that it will set up “concrete measures likely to promote democracy and
the law, and to fight against corruption”.</font>
<p><font face="Tahoma">The students’ leaders answer has been the starting
point for an agreement in 12 points, a kind of register of grievances,
which has been passed on to the Popular national assembly, the Council
of state and the Central committee of the party, then published in extenso
by the “China Daily”. This manifesto for democracy proposed a negotiation
based on the choice of the delegates, the equality of speech time between
both sides, the live coverage of the debates by the Chinese and foreign
media, etc. In one word all the things that constitute the basis of the
classic program of a democratic bourgeois opposition. The students’ leaders
recalled there again that it was neither about deviating from the socialist
system, nor to question the very foundations, which it is based on.</font>
<p><font face="Tahoma">It’s when the proletarians showed the most massively
their potential force, when the government tried to put pressure to calm
down the agitation (demonstrating practically its fear that the movement
plunging into an unfavourable balance of forces), that the organized and
controlled leadership of the movement issued a register of grievances asking
to have a fully-fledged place in this bloody system.</font>
<p><font face="Tahoma">But at the same time, two millions of proletarians
demonstrated in Beijing demanding the resignation of Deng Xiao Ping and
Li Peng. One hundred thousand people marched in Shanghai, and thousands
of others in Shengdu, Wuhan Qingdao, etc. What clearly shows the spreading
of the movement, and not its limitation to the alone Tian An Men Square,
so much covered by the bourgeois media.</font>
<p><font face="Tahoma">As for the government, it got militarily ready and
massed troops around the capital city. However, some regiments (among other
the 38th, which was in direct and continuous contact with proletarians)
refused to follow the orders.</font>
<p><font face="Tahoma">At any moment the struggle oscillated between, on
one hand, the affirmation of the proletariat’s interests, against democracy,
against the reforms, against the system that makes them die; and on the
other hand, the submission to the bourgeoisie’s ideologies, while the proletarians
relayed all the bloody flags (equality, rights, liberty, democracy) that
excluded them from the struggle for their own class interests.</font>
<p><font face="Tahoma">With strong demagoguery, Li Peng, and then Zao Ziyang
(it was necessary for the bourgeoisie to play all its cards, the most conservative
as well as the most radical ones) went at the hunger strikers’ bedside,
abjuring them to stop their movement for “the unity of the country”. It’s
indeed when the government insisted on the economic consequences of the
crisis in order to stigmatise the gravity of the situation, that the students
announced the stoppage of the hunger strike and invited the workers to
stop the striking movement.</font>
<p><font face="Tahoma">Moreover to demonstrate the pacifist intentions
of the movement, the students’ organizations delegates called the proletarians
to give back the weapons in their possession and to “commit themselves
to remain worthy and responsible in the confrontation with the authorities”!!!
These delegates, real unionists, were those who constantly braked, sabotaged
and broke the struggling movement. It’s them, these good democrats, who
therefore disarmed the struggling proletarians, leaving them powerless
facing the bourgeois military terror. It’s also them who handed over to
the cops (and therefore sentenced to death!) the few proletarians who smudged
the portrait of the bourgeois Mao, on Tian An Men Square, action that concentrated
in itself a perspective of qualitative rupture with democracy in China,
and the Maoist circus which it is decorated with.</font>
<p><font face="Tahoma">More and more, the bourgeoisie was consolidating
its power. Li Peng proclaimed the martial law in Beijing, while claiming
to want to continue to discuss, and transported more reliable troop to
the capital. Then, he issued an appeal for the troops “to punish the agitators
who set up unofficial organizations, and to force the students to go back
unconditionally to their campus”. But very quickly the troops met proletarians’
cordons inviting them to fraternize and forbidding the military trucks
progression.</font>
<p><font face="Tahoma">When Li Peng issued his ultimatum, asking for the
evacuation of Tian An Men Square for fear of military intervention, millions
of proletarians everywhere in China went on taking to the streets, defying
the martial law.</font>
<p><font face="Tahoma">The army was sent for restoring law and order, and
to suppress “agitation”, but this army was divided: facing a caste of officers
enjoying the biggest privileges, the rank and file had no motivation and
was badly fed, lodged in precarious conditions and didn’t enjoy any respect,
hence its kindliness in relation to the movement. Everywhere, fraternizations
between “soldiers” and “civilians” took place, uniting in the struggle
proletarians having the same interests.</font>
<p><font face="Tahoma">It was for fear that the desertions within the army
and the scenes of fraternization increase that the 38th regiment, too much
in contact with demonstrators, has been carefully standing at ease, and
its major has been dismissed, whereas the 27th corps, more reliable marched
into battle. Traffic in Beijing was practically forbidden thanks to roadblocks
made of busses, lorries, trucks, but also thanks to the intervention of
great floods of people who deployed to forbid the possible advance of the
troops. Hundreds of demonstrators thus prevented thousands of armed soldiers
to get into position, who reached the station with special trains. Fifteen
thousands proletarians also blocked a convoy of 41 trucks loaded with infantrymen
17 km to the East of Tian An Men Square, forcing them to turn back after
scenes of fraternization. Similar scenes took place in the suburbs; some
officers also refused to use strong-arm methods. Finally, the army declared
to be ready “to act without hesitation in conformity with the martial law”.
Manhunt against proletarians was open; the slaughter could start!</font>
<p><font face="Tahoma">June the 3rd, the army clashed with proletarians.
Thousands of soldiers without weapons were booed by more or less one million
of proletarians who took to the streets and resisted. In Nanjing a demonstration
of 100,000 people took place to protest against the assault of Beijing.
In Shanghai proletarians set up barricades and blocked buses. Demonstrations
took place in most cities of the provinces. There were confrontations opposing
different military units, some hostile and other favourable to the repression.</font>
<p><font face="Tahoma">In order to limit fraternizations, the troops in
charged of repression came from all the regions of China (preventing practically
the fraternization between soldiers and proletarians, while not speaking
the same language) and intervened after having been deprived of information
during two weeks. The 27th corps responsible for the repression clashed
with the hostile 38th body that tried to oppose the massacre.</font>
<p><font face="Tahoma">Soldiers deserted their ranks, joined struggling
proletarians and used together their weapons, and columns of tanks and
military trucks were completely burned. The struggle spread to the all
China. Riots broke out almost everywhere: e.g. in Wuhan, Shanghai, Harbin,
Shengdu. The power retaliated while launching denunciatory campaigns at
the television, while using pictures of demonstrations. All Beijing was
under army control. The repression got organized, and arrests increased.
Borders were sealed.</font>
<p><font face="Tahoma">Several thousands of proletarians were shot dead,
crushed under tanks, sentenced by special courts and sent to rot in jails
and other rehabilitation camps.</font>
<h2>
<u><font face="Tahoma">3. Conclusion</font></u></h2>
<font face="Tahoma">In conclusion we want to underline and summarize four
points that refer to four phases of what happened in China.</font>
<p><font face="Tahoma">1. The origin of revolts in China directly stood
in the context of world capitalist crisis and proletariat’s reactions facing
the productive forces restructuring this crisis imposed everywhere. Faced
with reforms and violent decrease of living conditions imposed by the exploitation
forces, the proletariat rose up spontaneously almost everywhere in China,
attacking private property and its direct defenders –government’s representatives
at the time and local repression forces-. These struggles started first
in the provinces and were the fact of the whole of “categories” of the
proletariat. It was only subsequently that things also changed in the capital
and there, democracy got quickly the upper hand over the struggle of the
proletariat.</font>
<p><font face="Tahoma">The limitation of this spontaneous uprising stood
in the lack of organizational consequence angry proletarians showed. Workers
didn’t try to endow themselves with an organized centre capable to make
emerge a direction to the struggle, in terms of generalization of the uprising,
and in terms of affirmation of the autonomous perspectives of the proletariat
too.</font>
<p><font face="Tahoma">2. As in most revolts that shook the world the years
before, the struggling proletariat in China didn’t succeed in setting up
an organized centre, bearing its own flags and affirming its class autonomous
interests. From then on, democracy filled this emptiness. In Beijing the
situation was more under control, because the democratic forces were much
more centralized and concentrated; and therefore Beijing substituted, as
a spectacle, as formal centre, as media reference, etc., for the struggling
movements in the provinces.</font>
<p><font face="Tahoma">From then on, democracy disarmed the proletariat,
and this according to three axes:</font>
<p><font face="Tahoma">* globally, the media started an international disinformation
that, while geographically unbalancing the events around Beijing, also
politically buried the struggles against reforms and the proletariat’s
attacks against property, in the pacific demand of political reforms of
the capitalist management system, demand which were formulated by a democratic
opposition gathered around the “students’ coordination”.</font>
<p><font face="Tahoma">* the transformation as a material force of this
bourgeois disinformation, combined with the weakness of the proletariat
in the affirmation of its own purposes, gave the leadership of the struggle
to this democratic opposition, mainly under shape of students’ leaders
regrouped in the “students’ coordination”; it’s this coordination that
disarmed the proletariat in the literal sense.</font>
<p><font face="Tahoma">* Deng Xiao Ping’s government, from the most reformists
to the most conservatives, prepared the repression while lulling the proletariat
into the negotiation with democratic opponents and mustered during this
time reliable forces to crush the movement.</font>
<p><font face="Tahoma">3. The world remained without news of what happened
in the provinces where (if we can believe the bourgeois media), the reactions
of anger were conditioned only by what was going on in Beijing. In the
same time, the crucial moment on Tian Year Men Square happened when, a
few days before the massacre, the “students’ coordination” asked the demonstrators
on the square to give the weapons back (1). In front of that, the proletariat
generally submitted and, rather than to organize themselves against those
who disarm them (government and opposition as well), most of them obeyed
the democrats’ orders. It was precisely the crucial moment and everything
was decided. A few hundreds of proletarians, organized and determined to
fight with the bourgeoisie in all its forms, could have allowed a qualitative
leap in the organization of the resistance against the repression, about
the armed struggle on the spot, while associating and directing millions
of people ready to fight in Beijing, as well as about the organization
of the prevailing defeatism within the army. This dynamics of centralizing
the struggles and the slap it implied for the bourgeois forces regrouped
in Beijing, would probably have allowed in return a generalization, a junction
with the movement in the whole of China. But the proletariat didn’t take
the initiative; it let itself be ingenuously disarmed while contemplating
the Statue of Liberty erected on the square, rather than to follow the
example of the few courageous comrades who had started throwing pots of
paint on the portrait of Mao.</font>
<p><font face="Tahoma">4. It’s in the defeat that the proletariat re-emerged.
Facing the army that intervened to finish off the job of those who had
disarmed the workers, the proletariat tried to arm; it fraternized with
deserters, executed its assassins and postponed several times the massacre.
But it was too late: it was not anymore the moment to consider the possibility
to reverse the balance by power. The proletariat has not been defeated
as the army began to shoot –on the contrary, on this occasion it showed
all its potential of fighting spirit-, but rather when it became the “partisan”
of democracy and freedom, supporting the left wing of bourgeoisie in its
efforts to liberalize the market.</font>
<p><font face="Tahoma">The bourgeoisie in the government in China overcame
very momentarily. Like the thousands of other tyrants in history and who
imagined remaining eternally in control, Deng Xiao Ping didn’t overcome
the hate of those he submitted. But the state in China was much more than
the Deng Xiao Ping faction, and if he already sank into oblivion, other
factions will impose themselves to preserve capitalism. It’s probably among
those who, within the “students’ coordination”, swore their full allegiance
to capital and its democracy while ensuring the disarming of the proletariat,
that the bourgeoisie recruited its future managers.</font>
<p><font face="Tahoma">In this way, more and more, with the generalization
of parliamentary democracies everywhere in the world, with the world restructuring
of productive forces and the exacerbation of competition it produces, with
the deepening of the world economic crisis and the wars that will be organized
to solve it, and therefore with this every time more obvious universalization
of the conditions in which the proletariat is exploited, in this way the
biggest revolutionary deflagration that the world will know is brewing
and sharpening. But before this, the proletariat should necessarily go
through a stage of international discussion around the lessons its history
allowed to formulate, and to point out democracy –in all its form-, as
its worst enemy.</font>
<p><font face="Tahoma">May it remembers then that in China, and more especially
in Beijing, in 1989, Democracy took the appearance of these students’ democratic
leaders who, as good pupils of capitalism organized in the “students’ coordination”,
broke the proletariat’ fervour, from the dawn of the struggling movement
till its bloody crushing. Already on April the 23rd, at the very beginning
of the movement in Beijing, while at the end of the afternoon hundreds
of proletarians assaulted the People’s Palace, headquarters of the popular
national assembly, pointing thus out spontaneously the mortal enemy of
communism, the students’ leaders intervened to prevent such an action to
be achieved. On Tian An Men Square these same democrats organized the maintenance
of law and order in direct and admitted collaboration with the cops of
Deng Xiao Ping, flooding the demonstrators with nonviolent propaganda,
giving in the weapons present on the square to the authorities and even
going until handing over to the police the workers who smudged the portrait
of the bourgeois Mao! Death to Democracy!</font>
<h3>

<font face="Tahoma">1. The disarming at least revealed a more contradictory
reality than how it appeared at first sight. While the disarming was a
shocking confirmation of the historic experience according to which the
task of the democratic organizations is invariably to disarm the proletariat
(literally, in this case), this showed at the same time the presence on
the square of a spontaneous proletarian tendency ready to go against nonviolence!</font>
