<h2>
<u><font face="Tahoma">Nothing new in the Eastern bloc!</font></u></h2>
<font face="Tahoma">In 1989 Eastern European bourgeoisie carried out spectacular
changes (1) in the management of capital and in the containment of the
proletariat. In Poland, Hungary, Eastern Germany, Czechoslovakia, reforms
were going round as well as restructuring, political parties were “legalised”
and multiplied, and the media were “liberalized,” with a “great breath
of freedom” all over the world as the democratic propaganda pretended.</font>
<p><font face="Tahoma">But did these upheavals, and these changes in the
functioning of the bourgeoisie mean something? Which necessity did these
reforms originate from? They above all fitted to the necessity for the
bourgeoisie to manage the crisis, while defending its rate of profit, and
while anticipating and preventing the unavoidable rebellions, as resulting
of the economic pressure that the proletariat was (and is still) suffering.</font>
<p><font face="Tahoma">The crisis of capital has no borders but it expresses
in different ways, according to the possibilities for the local bourgeois
to contain it. Eastern European countries’ economy was bankrupted and collapsing.
Information collected here and there showed the lack of work and the weakness
of productivity: e.g. in Czechoslovakia, such a worker said that in his
printing house “one actually works only two days per week,” another one
reported that “the workers sometimes lose half of their working time because
of the bad organization.” Often the proletarians called their wage a “financial
support for employment” since they all considered being half unemployed.
A worker from the GDR spoke about absenteeism of around 50% in her factory.
A Russian worker summarized the situation with this joke: “we pretend to
work, and the state pretends to pays us!”</font>
<p><font face="Tahoma">The democratic hypocrisy appeared once again especially
through the media’s heartfelt cry: “One must help Poland to go through
the winter.” As if capital could develop any help, solidarity and brotherhood!
The only reason why the bourgeoisie was ready to share some bread, it’s
their fear that hunger could turn into a huge attack on their terrorist
order. The hunger riots in Argentina in 1989 showed us how fast the bourgeois
order can appear generous when the proletariat is getting restless: only
a few hours after the beginning of the riots, trucks full of food were
sent in the workers’ districts.</font>
<p><font face="Tahoma">The relative protectionism and the rigid statist
structures in the Eastern countries resulted in the fact that in the relentless
war bourgeois factions wage on against each other, the capitalist constellations
and actually and nowadays ruling factions, e.g. represented by the EC or
the USA, got the upper hand and dictated their laws stressing much more
on open free-market.</font>
<p><font face="Tahoma">It was therefore an absolute necessity for these
central Europe nations to restructure “their” economy, in order to offset
the decreasing of capitalist profits through a decline of the workers’
social wage, as well as to prevent the proletarians rising up and rejecting
any reformism, any bourgeois alternative. Once again, the bourgeoisie succeeded
with an unbelievable speed and flexibility in adapting itself.</font>
<p><font face="Tahoma">The old Stalinist oligarchies were ousted with such
an ease that clearly showed how vital it was for the whole system that
a reformist team take over. This plan was almost alike in all these countries
where the opposition and the left wing of the national “communist parties”
managed the reforms and the transition towards a multiparty system, free
elections, etc. And thus the “Polish Unity Workers’ Party” and the trade
union “Solidarity,” the Eastern German “Socialist Unity Party” and the
“New Forum,” the Hungarian CP –which became SP- and the “Democratic Forum,”
etc. ad nauseam, all of them yesterday false “rivals,” were then waving
together the flag of their national economy and discussing about the end
of Stalinism, about the realization of the common democratic ideal, and
the necessity to save the country, etc. Together they called proletarians
for calm and to avoid using violence. In Prague, Vaclav Havel and Dubcek
(from the “Civic Forum”) shook the hands of their former Stalinist jailers.
In Moscow, the yesterday murderers called then officially the invasion
of Czechoslovakia in 1968 a “mistake”. The bourgeoisie’s alternatives played
their role, while of course always agreeing with the essential, i.e. the
maintenance of the capitalist order: they tried to fool us while describing
this “opposition” as being opposed to the real problems that cause misery,
repression and terror.</font>
<p><font face="Tahoma">Eastern proletarians were thus fed with the promises
of the blissful-making “multiparty system” in Western countries. The happy
future and the hopeful answer sold then to them, it’s the freedom of speech
and association, freedom of worship and of the press, free elections and
unions, human rights, free market and economy, i.e. rights and rights and
always rights, but still no bread! As if the fact to legally associate
in the same parliament different ideological but however interconnected
factions of the bourgeoisie would alter something to the fact that in the
West as in the East the democratic order, exploitation was (and still is)
going on to rule further. And de facto, those who were too credulous with
the promises of the state in the East and though that their situation would
improve, those quickly became disillusioned by the reality of capitalist
continuity. We didn’t have to wait long for the democratic forces of the
different “Forum” providing weapons to the defence of their reforms and
shooting at the proletarians, to realize that they defend the same interests
than the Stalinists. Alike that Russian housewife, who cynically declared
not finding the “Perestroika” when opening her refrigerator, the Eastern
proletarians quickly became disillusioned, when being confronted with the
fact that, no matter which faction is the manager, capital has no other
possibility but deepening its catastrophic crisis and worsening proletariat’s
living conditions.</font>
<p><font face="Tahoma">That’s where the struggling proletarians were suppressed
with tanks in 1953, one hoped then calming down the explosive situation
through law and rights, i.e. the right to be exploited as well as the freedom
to vote for our exploiters. That was the bourgeois alternative towards
decades of rough and strict Stalinism against which proletarians rose up.</font>
<h2>
<u><font face="Tahoma">In Berlin, a wall fell, but misery went on!</font></u></h2>
<font face="Tahoma">In Eastern Germany the bourgeoisie ran after the general
dissatisfaction in order to take it over. The extremely explosive character
of the situation gradually forced the state to legalize the huge demonstrations
of the summer of 1989, to approve the numerous departure-propositions towards
the West, to oust the old mummy Honecker, to propose a multiparty system
and free elections, to oust Egon Krenz after a short attempt to make the
new state-leader of this Honecker’s right-hand man, and finally to remove
the Berlin wall, to imprison especially the most odious members of the
former government, etc. However such spectacular measures didn’t seem to
calm down quickly enough the long restrained anger and fury of the proletarians.
Those who then took to the streets, asked for an explanation. In Dresden,
Rostock, Cottbus and Suhl, they entered the buildings of the state security
police (the “Stasi” murderers), and destroyed documents and files. In Erfurt,
demonstrators set up “vigilance committees” in order to control the buildings
of the secret police. Actions were led against the Eastern German army
(the NVA), but also against the Soviet armed forces. The government issued
several calls for maintaining “security and order,” while stressing on
the necessity “to guarantee the security of the military installations
and to prevent the illegal access on weapons and fuel oils.”</font>
<p><font face="Tahoma">Because they were scared that the proletariat should
be too close to the weapons, which could be used for overthrowing this
society, the Eastern German bourgeoisie disarmed the militia troops in
the factories, because the weapons these troops were equipped with (recoilless
canons, anti-aircraft defence, grenade launchers, tanks, etc.), represented
a big temptation for all those who, beyond the democratic circus organized
by the opposition, were dreaming to further do battle with military methods
against the class enemy. All the bourgeois factions without distinction
were afraid of the explosion and preventively gathered the weapons as a
precaution. The “New Forum” felt the danger for democracy coming from the
proletariat and increased calling for calm and disarming. The Protestant
church pointed out: “if the anger of the population is understandable (...),
no violence can be excused (...) and nobody can yield to hate.”</font>
<p><font face="Tahoma">The bourgeoisie was running until it was out of
breath in order to prevent an explosion of the situation. And never mind
the ideologies, which yesterday represented the different bourgeois factions,
they had no role to play. The same yesterday “right-winger” Stalinists,
who were behind and executed the mass murders of 1953 (e.g. Egon Krenz,
the Honecker’s successor), acted then as vanguard for reforming and restructuring
at all costs, while the opposition (“New Forum” among others) took concerted
action, while approving and transforming each increase in discontent from
the grass roots into a responsible demand for more democracy, for a “real
socialism.” Giving a “human face” to inhumanity, showing an acceptable
picture of their exploitation and misery to proletarians, that was the
project of the bourgeois politics and the “political changes” in the GDR
(but also e.g. in Czechoslovakia). The bourgeoisie responded too late in
other socialist countries, e.g. in Algeria and China, and couldn’t avoid
the bloodbath.</font>
<p><font face="Tahoma">But there was another ghost that the bourgeoisie
brought out again during the restructuring in Eastern Germany: reunified
Germany. It’s clear that there is no “German question” from our class point
of view. The reason to put forward the question of the reunification of
both countries was to hijack the proletarians’ struggle about the improvement
of their living conditions and to turn it into the defence of a state concentrating
and centralising more important productive forces than the ones of the
competing nations. Nothing in common with the wish of the Eastern German
proletarians to meet up with parents or friends again on the other side
of the wall, or with the fact that workers were going to Western Germany
for higher wages or looking after commodities, which were unobtainable
in the East. But the state used these phenomenons in order to encourage
the nationalism and to drown the proletarian interests in it.</font>
<p><font face="Tahoma">And de facto, as from September 1989 Eastern Germans
left one nation for another in order to find work. Hardly arrived, they
experienced the joys of “Western free market” under the shape of dozens
of bosses of small and big companies, who were searching for some cheap
labour force. Since however there was not enough of work for everyone at
all, the Eastern German workers directly became in competition with their
class brothers.</font>
<p><font face="Tahoma">If the monopolies and the tendency to big economic
concentrations (tendency which becomes more pronounced in times of crisis
because it’s about being stronger faced with the competition), probably
drove to reunification of Germany, it was anyway and finally realised against
the present and future interests of the workers.</font>
<p><font face="Tahoma">As valorisation area of capital, the GDR was dependent
upon the FRG already for a long time: e.g. tax exemption for exports, privileged
trade agreements, 3.3 billion Deutsche Marks per year interest-free loan
aid in kind, etc. So to speak the GDR was actually the thirteenth member
of the EC! Moreover this aid became even more intensive after the removing
of the “iron curtain” in November 1989. But this support was of course
not philanthropic at all. Proletarians in the GDR couldn’t improve their
material situation through these “aids”. The lent funds concerned only
the managers of capital.</font>
<p><font face="Tahoma">The unified Germany issue, the multiparty system
and free elections, the abolition of the constitution article over the
leading role of the “Socialist Unity Party,” the opening of the wall, etc.,
all this misery and wretched toys about rights and liberties coming back
were summarized in the consideration of an Eastern German football supporter:
“Now, we can also support our team outside!” Apart from it they especially
gained the right to go window-shopping while visiting the West, as many
proletarians stressed on. But however, in order to buy commodities, the
Eastern German proletarians didn’t really need windows but rather money.
A wall fell but misery went on!</font>
<p><font face="Tahoma">The reunification of Germany and the first step
into this direction that the opening up of the wall represented didn’t
have only supporters. With demagogic electioneering slogans, the bourgeois
faction interested in a unified Germany met with a “rampart” against the
“migration movements from the East.” Or better said, the European governments
were scared with the potential influx of migrant unemployed. They reminded
in this context of the “population increase from the Mediterranean countries.”
The reality seems to be harmless while using all these safe and comfortable
euphemisms of the “political analysts.”</font>
<p><font face="Tahoma">It is clear that the bourgeoisie in the East didn’t
produce these reformist ideas willingly; it was forced by the proletariat
to do like this. The experience of Tiananmen forced the Eastern European
bourgeoisie to draw some lessons. Either they had to quell the movements
initiated a little bit everywhere in the East with much bloodshed, like
they did in the GDR 1953, in Hungary 1956, in Poland 1980 or even in China
1989, what in the end could prompt the development of proletarian direct
action and class consciousness; either the local bourgeoisies developed
methods and ways to defuse the movement, while proposing something sufficiently
“new,” something as “showy” as the “Perestroika” in Russia, but of course
in accordance with the local circumstances.</font>
<p><font face="Tahoma">The problem for the bourgeoisie in Eastern Germany,
confronted with a so explosive situation, was that a massive armed repression,
like the mass-murder of Tiananmen, for several reasons, was very risky,
if not even impossible. Firstly, because the use of the local gendarme
(i.e. the 380,000 Soviet soldiers who were stationed in the GDR) was almost
impossible, because the whole reforms campaign of the Eastern European
bourgeoisie, to keep the control on the proletariat in this zone, would
then be completely jeopardised. Secondly, because a mass-murder, as it
happened in China, would be high-risk for the bourgeoisie, especially about
the generalisation of the unrest: even the proletarians in Western Germany
would be roused, because there were many bonds uniting them beyond the
“Wall,” and especially, violent struggles and solidarity actions of the
Eastern European populations would then be provoked, populations suffering
from the economic crisis and austerity they were exasperated with.</font>
<p><font face="Tahoma">All the bourgeois factions in the West had pretty
well understood what was at stake behind the demonstrations of discontent
in the East. Whereas they didn’t have stopped to bore us in the West with
the necessity to put an end to “socialism,” whereas they had never missed
an opportunity to propose us to go over there “if it was not convenient
for us here,” in the moment all these assholes played for us the show of
“solidarity” with the problems the Eastern European nations had to face.
The Belgian prime minister summarized the opinion of the European bourgeoisie,
while calling for doing everything, which is possible to do, “in order
the USSR keeps the control over its satellite countries.” Was there a clearer
invitation for the USSR to assume its practice of local gendarmerie further?
In the same way in a common accord, both big military blocks, NATO and
the Warsaw Pact, decided to get their alliances unchanged. The bourgeois
in the West, and more widely everywhere in the world, didn’t stop to recommend
the status quo, the equilibrium, smooth reforms… They had only the word
“stability” in their mouth, because behind the “instability” they saw the
first stirrings of the old mole’s nose. The ghost of communism still haunted
Europe!</font>
<h2>
<u><font face="Tahoma">The old mole is digging and digging...</font></u></h2>
<font face="Tahoma">Although the proletariat existed as a ghost, nevertheless
the weaknesses while asserting itself were very important. It’s really
hard to see how it was easy for the different bourgeois factions to contain
the proletariat and to make them waving their own flags: in GDR and in
Czechoslovakia, it wasn’t the black and red flags that waved over the heads
of the demonstrators, but that of nation, liberty, democracy and multiparty-system.
The bourgeoisie thus succeeded in erecting a tunnel, whose exit can only
lead to a war, at least if the proletariat continues to behave quietly
with the left wing of democracy.</font>
<p><font face="Tahoma">Faced with this dark perspective and proletariat’s
weaknesses, we can be guardedly optimistic however. Not of course while
considering the tragic lack in the preparation for the struggles to come,
but in relation to the more and more obvious standardization of the living
standards of the proletariat, and also the speeches used by the bourgeoisie
in order to justify the crisis. The word “democracy” is on each bourgeois’
lips in order to force their program upon the proletariat. But even if
the speech about democracy is still today deluding the masses of too credulous
proletarians, the objective impossibility for the “democrats” to offer
another perspective than misery can only push the proletariat to shatter
the democratic myth and to bring democracy to light on a worldwide scale:
everywhere, independently of the local “regime” at the time and beyond
any ideological disguise, democracy is nothing but the terrorist way of
life of capital! Will it last long until the proletariat will have to face
the guns of the police of Walesa, Havel and Co? And when the “New,” “Democratic,”
“Civic” or “Socialist” Forums will send armed forces to protect democracy,
and to shoot at those who won’t accept no longer the speeches over the
necessity to make “sacrifices”? Will it then need long argumentations to
show the democratic substance shared by the “dictatorship of a one-party
system” and that of a “multiparty system?”</font>
<p><font face="Tahoma">After the collapse of the trap of pseudo-socialism,
what’s the Eastern bourgeoisie had left in order to falsify, channel and
contain the struggles? The new credo of “Gorbatshow,” the “economic solidarity”
about restoring the economy of the country, didn’t work. More and more
and everywhere, the proletariat will have to confront the police and military
repression in the struggles to come.</font>
<p><font face="Tahoma">The standardization of the exploitation conditions
and the ideological traps can only strengthen the standardization of the
proletariat, and therefore also its response while struggling.</font>
<p><font face="Tahoma">What appeared as a victory of the bourgeoisie (which
was strong enough in order to foresee a rebellion-movement, and to break
it), will actually backfire on our enemy and become the strengthening of
the working class. Go on old mole dig further…</font>
<h3>
<u><font face="Tahoma">Note</font></u></h3>
<font face="Tahoma">(1) These changes are admittedly “spectacular,” and
even “showy” in the superficial sense of the bourgeois media, however this
adjective is not synonymous with “essential,” because precisely the bourgeois
reforms were (and always are!) nothing but necessary corrections of the
exploitation conditions. While talking of “spectacular changes,” we refer
to the “spectacularization” and the bourgeois performance made from superficial
changes, which were (and always are!) neither essential nor factual changes
of the immediate situation for the proletariat. Moreover these “changes”
didn’t afford any real perspective for the bourgeoisie to get out of the
crisis. The only “showy” feature of the reforms in Eastern Europe was the
show organized by the bourgeois media.</font>
