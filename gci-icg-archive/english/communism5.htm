<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">Introduction</font></u></h2>
In this editorial, we'll try to make a first step forward in the public
definition of what we consider to be the end of a stage in the life of
our group and at the same time the beginning of another stage.
<p>We don't want to wipe out the past and pretend starting from scratch
again. On the contrary, our aim is to try to synthetize the ten years of
life and activities of our little group of militants by drawing lessons,
political conclusions and directives.
<p>A communist organisation is not a little communist society within capitalist
society. It is neither an oasis of perfection in the andst of capitalism
even though in its bosom the real proletarian vanguard might cristallize
itself. A communist group is a living expression of the contradiction that
makes the proletariat go always further by moving from breakings to breakings
(the communist struggle is a permanent movement of negations, breakings,
overtakings,...) but it is clear that there are always and there always
will be different expressions and materialisations of the lack of breaking
with capitalist society.
<p>Vulgar materialism or idealism (usually both combined together) are
constant deviations, existing in every communist organisation ever since
the first attempts of struggle against Capital and the State. Expressions
of this kind of deviations (alterations) can be found in different ranges
of revolutionary action and more specifically in communist publications.
Our group is convinced that only permanent criticism and self-criticism,
as well as the biggest attention we pay to the criticism from our contacts,
correspondents, and the proletarians in general, can help us fight such
deviations. And the whole of these criticisms must be centralised through
the internal and international polemics we have always had. It is these
permanent criticisms assumed by all militants and centralized also through
a series of organisational mechanisms that help us going forward.
<p>A little time ago, our group announced through its press the publication
of a criticism of some previous articles (1) such as "Pour un front de
classe" (in "Le Communiste" No3) and "La nature catastrophique du capitalisme"
(2) (in "Le Communiste" No7). These criticisms materialized for us a new
step forward that allowed us to break more clearly from political economy
and from the politics of the Social-democratic left. This, at that time
(1982) resulted in the split of some comrades who later on constituted
a grouping without perspectives (it was to disappear a few years later)
called "The Internationalist Communist Fraction". During the recent phase
lived by the ICG, the same tendency, characterized by idealism and dualism
proper to social-democracy, reappeared and materialized through different
practices and expressions which have led us to a phase of clarification
also ending up in exclusions.
<p>The central problem of the article "Pour un front de classe" was to
see in the proletariat, before anything else, its heterogeneity, and to
relegate to a position of secondary importance the community of interests,
of perspectives, the social project, the programme: and so all this to
the detriment of the essential determinations that make up a social class.
The same deviation is also present in the idealist line against which we
recently had to fight, but of course this only is an example. We will talk
about the characteristics proper to both expressions of idealism later
on in this text. Nevertheless, this idealist line has expressed itself
in different articles of our reviews and even some texts that we still
consider to be globally correct and that orientate our activities are impregnated
with expressions reflecting an idealist conception. For example, "Les t&acirc;ches
des communistes" (in "Le Communiste" No21) where one can read: "And once
more, even if this might make the new philosophers of the democratic ultra-left
roar, the difference between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie is the
will to struggle (sic) against alienation and all the capitalist shit"
(3).
<p>The same deviation expresses itself in the article "L'Europe des Versaillais"
(in "Le Communiste" No25) - see the self-criticism below. Also the pamphlet
on "Spain - May '37" published together with the group RAIA contains as
well big problems always in relation to this idealist line we are criticizing.
Here also, the party is presented as an external being, foreign to the
proletarians who are fighting; the "lack" of the Party is not expressed
as the real weakness of a worldwide balance of forces, nor as the weakness
of the level of preparation and centralization of the struggles, but as
the immediate absence of an organization, genius but not existing (the
"Rambo" party, possessor of lessons, positions,... to be given to the proletarians,
but this party never existed and of course never will exist!). This way,
the internationalist and historical dimension of the party is wiped out.
For us, even in these moments of defeat (the thirties) there exist militants
organised in the historical line of the party (like for example the Italian
Fraction of the Communist Left in France and Belgium regrouped around "Bilan",
or still the Communist Left of Mexico that published "Comunismo") and although
they may be very clear, they cannot possibly avoid the deep defeat of THEIR
PARTY in Spain. In the same way, Marx's lucidity about the Paris Commune
(after its foundation, because before it, Marx position was oscillating)
did not prevent its failure. And Trotsky's position about "the lack of
the Party" during the Commune is ridiculous because insurrectional struggles
of our class always are expressions of our Party.
<p>"Be that as it may, the Paris insurrection, even if it comes to be defeated
by the wolves, the pigs and the dogs of the old society, is the most glorious
achievement of our party since the insurrection of Paris in June" (Marx
to Kugelmann - 12/4/1871).
<p>Of course in spite of this affirmation we do not give up anything from
our specific organisation as communists. This specific organisation does
not accept the discipline of the workers in general, does not dissolve
itself in any consultative democracy. Every fundamental struggle of our
class is our struggle. Therefore we see in every weakness, in every lack
of centralization, of leadership,... the problems of our own Party; and
this leads us to the total rejection of pompuous groups and positions that
instead of recognizing our class' weaknesses as their own and fighting
against them, imagine that what's missing for the class to realize the
insurrection, are their advices, and this is what they call "the Party".
In their analyses of history, they claim that the proletarians can do nothing
without these infaillible advisers they call "the Party" but who in reality
only correspond to the idyllic image of the bourgeois intellectual sitting
near his book and judging the past through his own little brain.
<p>These examples are not restrictive! Our group has constantly fought
and will keep on fighting inside as well as outside of the organisation
against the multiple expressions of the idealistic line that is rottening
the whole of the workers' movement. Against those who mix up the flag and
the movement, who think and claim the historical party not as the party
in history but as an ideal to be reached, who think that the transformation
of the world essentially depends on their voluntary activity and who activate
themselves to create any kind of committee under any kind of pretext and
without any perspectives; against those who theorize the abolition of the
family in capitalist society, who identify dialectic materialism with a
method of knowledge, who believe that communism develops itself independently
from the contradictions of capitalist society, who do not define the proletariat
by its real practice as an "exploited and revolutionary class" but only
by what they would like it to be, i.e. exclusively "revolutionary"; against
those who see the communists' organised actions as actions of incitement,
of stimulation, of creation (!) of the movement instead of as actions of
leadership of the movement rising spontaneously from the putrefaction of
this society; finally, against those who mix up the communist organisation
with a school of thought, who identify concepts with reality, the communist
programme with the Consciousness or with an ideal... in brief, against
the whole of these political deviations of genuine idealism we affirm practical
materialism, communist materialism (4). Idealism always explains history
from the individual, from his will and ideas; historical materialism on
the contrary explains how the social material conditions produce the individual,
his will and his ideas. Ideology itself always is a practice, a social
and material product as such, a material force. Ideology is matter. As
materialists we never start from the ideas one may have about the world
but we always start from social life, from the historical arch that relates
primitive society to integral communism... in brief, from real life.
<p>But like we've said before, a communist organisation is never completely
impervious to this kind or deviations proper to the world of Reason imposed
by the bourgeoisie. Therefore it is useless to try to find guarantees so
that these deviations should not express themselves anymore in our group.
Such guarantees do not exist; neither in organisational mechanisms nor
in the purety of the Idea. For us criticism and self-criticism is a very
important part of our activity and we haven't any other "guarantee" for
the development of our struggle but centralized discussions and fraternal
criticism. History of class struggle is full with mistakes, attempts, set-backs,...
To transform those weaknesses into strength through criticism and self-criticism,
such has always been the invariant practice of the most determined elements
of the Party; today it is our practice.
<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">Against idealism</font></u></h2>
The anddle of the sixties witnessed the re-emergence of the proletariat
as a social force on the scene of history. After many years of counter-revolution,
the old mole once again showed all those "who only believe what they see"
that the communist revolution wasn't dead and that the old mole never stopped
digging in spite of the forced sleep that social peace had inflicted on
it. The struggles led by our class all over the world were giving force
and confidence to all those who had never stopped defending our project:
the abolition of classes. To the terror of the bourgeoisie facing once
more the spectre of revolution corresponded - for the proletariat - a reinforcement
of the links in and through the struggle. The main victory for all those
who were struggling was this proletarian solidarity that developped itself
as the confrontation to the capitalist enemy got organised. During such
periods, the organisation into force, the tendency to constitute ourselves
into the party, to give a center to our struggles, are not the privilege
of such or such a group: it is reality itself that requires and impels
the grouping of revolutionaries.
<p>Wherever the proletariat had been more radical, struggling for its own
dictatorship, the flowing back of the struggle during the seventies materialized
itself in a dreadful defeat, in a phase of open terror from the State;
and in those areas where there had only been less significant struggles,
without much perspectives of generalisation, the seventies re-imposed social
peace with all its awful characteristics: competition, sectarism, anti-organisationalism,
individualism,...
<p>Today the few breaches opened up in the wall of social peace aren't
large enough for the historical and international reappearance of the proletariat.
And although the fact of plunging always deeper into the crisis does not
give credit to the bourgeois perspectives, neither does it lead to the
revolutionary transformation of this old world.
<p>In this climate of general defeat, when everyone tries to save himself
above all, the gap between the minority of the proletarians in struggle
and the majority of the working-class that keeps its mouth shut and continues
to accept all sacrifices, is more spectacular than ever. This reality,
proper to the counter-revolution and generally produced by the defeat of
an important wave of struggles, expresses itself ideologically in the idealistic
conception that considers the proletariat as an object on which one must
intervene through a small group of intellectuals who see themselves as
"subjects" because they have the "will" and/or the "consciousness" of the
revolution. Here as well counter-revolution produces counter-revolution:
the whole lot of theories splitting up the communist movement by putting
on one side "workers" and on the other side "the revolutionary intellectual"
only are the monstruous reflection of today's reality which, just like
a photography, i.e. in a non-dynamic way shows on one side the atomized
worker and on the other side the small groups that are theorizing.
<p>But we know that a photography of reality is just like the tree that's
hiding the forest: to limit reality to what one can see here and now, means
to hide the whole dynamic or a being (communism) which can only express
itself through all the richness of its historical affirmation - yesterday
- today -tomorrow. To give up this point oof view implies the projection
- in a mechanical-like manner - of today'ss weaknesses of the proletariat
onto the future. For us, classless society means the existence of a collective
unitarian being - the Gemeinwesen - which is being univocally expressed
during each wave of proletarian struggle by the tendency towards the setting
up of a unique worldwide centralization, clarifying and determining our
struggle against these divisions. The latter (once more: produced by counter-revolution,
imposed by democracy and State-terrorism) tend to dissociate, to atomize
proletarians and to turn them into free individuals, far away from the
"communists", also transformed here into free individuals, "importers of
consciousness"!
<p>Within our group, we have suffered from this idealistic, dualistic,
social-democratic illness that consists (by refusing to take into consideration
the social and material determinations of the community of struggle, interests,
programme, needs, revolutionary perspectives,... of which our group is
an historical product and factor; community of struggle invariably cristallized
during each period of struggle, in the ineluctable tendency of the proletariat
to constitute itself into a class and to centralize as a party) consists
in theorizing on one side the class as being determined by the "here and
now", the heterogeneity, the contengencies, by immediacy, conformism, by
the will to struggle... just for a fair place in this society, by the lack
of consciousness, etc. and on the other side, the party as being determined
by the "yesterday-today-tomorrow", by homogeneity, by the globality, the
will, the consciousness,...
<p>The ICG isn't an island of communism right in the andst of capitalism;
in a social context where competition and individualism are at their height
and despite the fact that the ICG is a pole of struggle against this shit,
it is impossible for our group not to reflect within itself some of today's
weaknesses the proletariat undergoes in the difficult process of constituting
itself as a class.
<p>For several years and in spite or the overwhelming weaknesses of this
particular period, we have been assuming what we really exist for as a
revolutionary group: developing internationalism, drawing lessons from
the defeats of our class all throughout history, fighting for the international
organisation of our class by impelling the regrouping of revolutionaries
all throughout the world (this got nothing to do with certain debates in
the anglo-french "revolutionary milieu"!). But all our efforts to assume
these invariant tasks, do not cure us from the determinations described
above: anti-organisationalism and individualism are poisons that we must
fight against including within our our own group. The idealistic tendency
that we've been fighting against all throughout the passed few years, and
against which only today we can clearly delimit the class-frontiers that
separate us from it, was aimed at liquidating our community of struggle
because of its anti-party contents.
<p>Like always our old enemy never stops reappearing in some new disguise,
but idealism betrays itself because it always ends up in considering the
"party", the "communists" as something pure, external to all social determinations.
<p>The invariable point of view of idealism is as follows: on one side
you've got the workers, atomised, plunged into the shit of this society,
and, on the other side you've got the "party", pure thing being strictly
determined by the efforts to revolt, the will to fight and/or the facts
of consciousness and will. This sometimes leads to the rejection of all
practical activity for the sake of only intellectualism, and at other times
to the apology of every single struggle no matter what the perspectives
may be. In fact, in most cases, it's a permanent and practical oscillation
between activism and theoricism. Indeed, those who see the party as a divine
perfection, sole possessor of the theory that will save the proletariat,
fall into activism much more often than one would imagine.
<p>Every single struggle becomes the object of a race in order to make
the idea of communism that supposedly is lacking for the struggle to be
revolutionary, become "real". Idealism invariably drifts towards immediatism
and ouvrierism. Like all bourgeois ideology, idealism is not just a conglomerate
of ideas, it is practise, a practise of sabotage of our efforts to constitute
a common organizational framework; it is an individualistic practise!
<p>The theory of the "communist" individual is the starting-point of this
deviation that negates the proletariat as the real subject of history.
This ideology comes from the disappointment minorities feel in the face
of the weaknesses of the proletariat. To get over their disillusion of
a revolution that is not "coming", those minorities think they can substitute
simple facts of will and consciousness to the historical weaknesses of
the proletariat and they believe that an association of rebels or theoricians
who call themselves revolutionaries can change the world. As communists
we know that in spite of our will and consciousness, the balance of forces
goes beyond our will-power and can never be reduced to the mere existence
or non-existence of such or such a group. When the proletariat doesn't
express in its struggles its ineluctable tendency to organize itself into
a force, to centralize itself as a party, the international organization
of the existing revolutionary forces feels the effects of this and becomes
even more difficult.
<p>Today's phase is a sectarian one, it reflects the increase of general
competition endured by the proletariat and corresponds to a discontinuous
phase of ups and downs historically linked up with the periods of embryonic
reconstitution of the proletariat. We try as hard as we can, with all our
will and all our consciousness, to fight against sectarism proper to today's
phase but we never forget that communism will loom up from the guts of
capitalism, from the shit of this world. All the consciousness and all
the will-power of revolutionary minorities isolated in the andst of an
ocean of social peace will never be sufficient to destroy capital.
<p>The limits of today's revolutionaries - those revolutionaries for whom
internationalism isn't an empty word and who really practically try to
organize a community or struggle and action against all frontiers, all
nations,... are the limits proper to this period. All those non- materialist
(in the sense that they deny the material power of the relationship between
classes) who think they'll be able to substitute facts of consciousness
and will to the real balance of forces in this world, are building up sects
that are each time "purer" than the previous ones, dreaming that they are
constructing with their brains the bed of the revolution where the proletariat
will just have to lie down in order to realize communism. And logically,
they'll blame the proletarians for not applying their ready-made recipes
to change the world. Whatever the form of this deviation, those who want
to substitute their personal consciousness and/or revolt to the real movement
of abolition of the established order, always sink into the apology of
the individual. This has been materialized in our group by a series of
individualistic practices, all tending more or less to gather the proletariat
aroundd their own clique, making impossible any kind of work or discussion
in common (cfr. their fury to defend their "freedom of thought" in the
group that has led them to a practice of sect whose idealistic and tautological
starting-point was: "Anyone who's not on my side, is against me!"). This
means more than just disorganizing the group, it is the reinforcement,
within our group, of individualistic competition!
<p>"Competition isolates individuals from each other; not only the bourgeois
but even more so the proletarians... Isolated individuals only form a class
through their fight against another class; otherwise they are just enemies
competing with one another." (Marx: "German ideology")
<p>The political struggle within the ICG against this deviation isn't new
and certainly isn't finished. Since 1979, date of birth of our organization,
this struggle has been materialized by different organisational splits
that have all led either to indifferentism or to activism, when it wasn't
just to the renunciation of all militant activity. Each time we've seen
that the "big programmatical disagreements" put forward, were only the
ideological screen behing which to hide the real discouragement in front
of the necessity to carry on the hard struggle against the current within
a group with many different experiences, origins, cultures and histories;
to hide an irresponsible and individualistic practice, an incapability
to assume the militant tasks; to conceal a real break with the organizational
framework. These "big programmatical disagreements" only are a screen to
cover up a series of successive disappointments in the face of immediate
activity and this has become clear by the incapability of these comrades
to maintain the priorities centrally decided by our group. The outcome
of such kind of split from the community of struggle and from organic centralism,
always is the individual. He then settles his own priorities, day by day,
calling into question every centralized activity; one day proposing the
exclusion of comrades who didn't assume such or such task and the other
day trying to form with them an organization in the organization; developing
one day the illusion of the immediate abolition of the family, and coming
back the next day to the worst social-democratic caricatures about the
dualism between militant life and private life, when everyone decides for
his own private life, with its inevitable complement: political officialdom!;
at last, deciding (always individually) to stop assuming the tasks decided
collectively and centrally, because the individual - this opportunist -submitted
to his humour of the day, suddenly considers that there are other -much
more inportant - things to do.
<p>For our group, all this expressed itself, for example, in the non-assumation
of a central review in Italian, as had been decided centrally (5), in our
weak interventions (i.e. with lesser forces than we would and should have
invested) in the railway strike in France, in the slowing down, if not
in the complete paralysis of some of the central tasks (amongst which the
elaboration of our "thesis of orientation", etc.).
<p>In the face of these ruptures with the organic discipline of our group,
our organization could only sanction this situation where the individual
had already - de facto - "recovered" his sacred freedom of thought and
action.
<p>We don't wish that the militants who've been excluded from our group,
will end the same way as those who split away from us before, but we want
to warn them about the fact that the sectarian and individual practices
that provoked this split, can only lead to the reproduction of the same
deviations within their own group. The countless problems we meet while
trying to set up an international community of struggle right in the andst
of a period of counter-revolution, cannot be resolved by a split based
on the first ideological argument one can think of. Sooner or later, this
incapability to assume together with us the inevitable and essential debates
linked to communist action, will lead to a practice of sect (6).
<p>There is one more thing we have to say to express the entirety of our
criticisms: we do not of course deny that there exist also real programmatical
disagreements, but most of the time they are not expressed by those who
pretend they are developing them. Indeed, it is not ideas that determine
their practice; but it is their practice that determines their ideas. That's
why, for example, the worst activism without principles can be covered
up by an ideological discourse theorizing the "purest" ideal about the
party. This has been confirmed by the experience of our class as well as
by our own experience. Organizational liquidationism always hides behind
the idealization of the party and/or of the communist society to be: from
this point of view, the perfection and the purification to be reached,
always makes today's organizative activity of seconday importance, the
same way as the idealization of the perfect "revolutionary" systematically
leads to the despise of today's comrades. In this sense, the ideology of
individualists, sectarians and liquidationists is important and has to
be analysed because it can cement their activity and therefore reinforces
their practice. But ideology can never be the starting-point of our explanation
and understanding... nor of our actions.
<p>The real true starting-point of the whole of these practices (sectarism,...)
is bourgeois society, competition between proletarians. And as for all
ideologies, their ideology as well cannot be considered as the key to the
understanding of their actions (cfr. national ideology: capital and its
war produce national ideology, but without it there would be no possibility
to send proletarians to be slaughtered and thus there would be no war.
So, as ideology, it becomes a material element of cohesion whose consideration
is essential on a second level of abstraction).
<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">Self-criticism of the editorial published
in our French review "Le Communiste"</font></u></h2>
Last year we published in our review in French "Le Communiste" an editorial
"l'Europe des Versaillais" that started of a violent polemic in our group
and that was to have a lot of repercussions right from its publication
up until today. We had planned its publication in our Spanish review as
well but straight away most comrades contested the very foundations of
the idealist and voluntarist orientations expressed in this editorial.
All these criticisms were centralised by the group (i.e. were circulated,
discussed,...) and consequently we decided not to publish the editorial
in "Comunismo", and to determine the main orientations for another text.
The result of this, is the text "Against State-terrorism" published also
in this issue of "Communism". Above all, these criticisms opened up a healthy
process of clarification in our group as well as the progressive decantation
of the different positions: all this ended up in some exclusions and resignations.
Some time later on, we received a pamphlet published by one of our ex-comrades
who's claiming to turn and transform his "exclusion" into a "split" sway
from the ICG. In his pamphlet, the ex-comrade operates such a rewriting
of history that he doesn't hesitate to present the publication of the editorial
in "Le Communiste" No25 as being the mistake of someone else while in fact
this text was published under his entire and exclusive responsability and
with the modifications he'd decided to introduce!
<p>But let's stop talking now about problems of responsibility that involve
more specifically the internal organisation of our militant activities
and let's concentrate ourselves on the decisive questions raised by this
editorial. Because, if we've been able to save to our readers in spanish,
arabic or english the lecture of an article that we consider as erroneous,
and although a detailed criticism of "l'Europe des Versaillais" has since
been published in "Le Communiste", we still think that an explanation in
the other languages is important (7).
<p>Let's start with some significant quotes from "l'Europe des Versaillais":
<p>"The crisis of their world (that leftists consider to be an agent of
revolution) proves to be the most powerful weapon of counter-revolution:
Europe isn't at the moment a centre of class struggle. We've often said
that the force of the State in Europe today isn't imposed by the force
of the bayonets, even so when the murder of terrorists or delinquent proletarians,
the raids against revolutionaries in the early morning hours, the thousands
of years of prison distributed by judges,... are the normal way of life
of the terrorists who govern us! The strenght of the State neither resides
in the massive recruitment of proletarians in popular or patriotic fronts
like this was the case during the black years before the second world-war.
Even if the State in Europe doesn't skimp the means to mobilize this big
whore called public opinion against Kadhafi, even if the leftists and sionist
rackets carry on mobilizing for peace, for the Nicaraguan revolution...
or for the next elections, nevertheless all these classical ways of governing
begin to smell musty. The smell of politicians and other democrats has
become so strong and repulsive that even the show-business of electoral
campaigns, of anti-racist and anti-apartheid concerts do not mobilise anymore.
<p>"Of course we do not deny that all these demonstrations, to which we
can add religion, cretinization through television and other medias, through
leisure, continue to exist and reappear permanently. But the spearhead
of submission today, in Europe, is the submission to national economy and
to economy as such. Workers' associationism today still is an exception,
the competition in order to survive remains the rule. Above all, what really
seems to matter today, is to make one's existence depend on the existence
of production, to make one's survival depend on the survival of our exploiters,
i.e. what is dominating today is the supposed community of interest between
each individual proletarian and capitalist economy. This is were State
terror is the strongest: "You'll be richer if your boss is richer, you'll
eat more if you're factory doesn't close down because of strikes, you'll
eat more if only the workers of other factories eat less,... In this Europe
of sacrifices, to struggle costs more, a lot more than the individual immediate
interest within the realm of the economical and political competition between
proletarians. Today, this individualism is the main force of non-struggle
dominating proletarians. While waiting till those who are married with
the economy will make up their mind and will start making their counts,
calculating in terms of life the price of sacrifices, we address ourselves
to those who do not accept this jungle, those frozen waters of selfish
calculation. We intend our activities for those who, in the face of the
terrorist blackmail by the State, refuse to pay the ransom. The strenght
of non-struggle is important, that's why we must, more than ever, join
our forces, associate ourselves, centralize ourselves. Not to weep about
the difficult period or about the terrible blows we're receiving from our
enemy, nor to put together our "realism" - eternal source of opportunism
and anti-communism. In the face of this real capitalist force, words cannot
change much, neither can explanations or reason (all proletarians know
what life is about!). Only the association of minorities of internationalist
communist militants, reinforcing communism wherever it exists, or more
precisely, clearing the way for communism, is useful. In brief, the association
of those who consider it costs less to "change the world" than to be changed
by it." (end of the quote from "l'Europe des Versaillais" Le Communiste
No25 pp.3 and 4).
<p>One can easily detect in this text a very strong reasoning in which
there's a mixture of true elements about the lack of constitution of the
proletariat into a class, and a whole series of interpretations that ignore
and deny the material determinations that push the workers (that "compel"
them, that "force" them, according to Marx) to constitute themselves into
a force. Once this determinism has been eliminated, the text despises the
revolutionary potentiality of the proletariat (which is logic) and sees
the revolution only within the "communist militant minorities"! Let's put
it this way: we do not deny or ignore (if anything) the decisive role of
internationalist communist militant minorities (but even this can only
be understood as a product of the material determinations of this society;
human beings with their consciousness, their will, make history but only
as far as they themselves are produced by the material conditions that
are their presuppositions and that they cannot decide upon nor change through
their will-power!). So once more, what we are really criticizing, is the
old social-democratic dualism that separates our class into on the one
hand the workers, on the other hand, bourgeois intellectuals who possess
the consciousness. The editorial reproduces the same dualism, but, of course,
in a more modern and radicalized version. This kind of separations lead
to an idealistic and voluntary conception, seeing the revolution as a product
of the will and consciouness of "revolutionaries" and/or of the "party".
We do not deny the terrible situation of the proletariat. Of course we
agree that "workers' associationism today still is an exception", that
"the competition in order to survive remains the rule"... and only euro-centrists
will deny that Europe "is not at the moment a centre of class struggle".
But we cannot admit, under any circumstances, the liquidation of the whole
of social determinations that constitute the fundamental motor of revolution,
while substituting to this, the voluntary activities of such or such "revolutionaries".
We cannot accept the ignorance of the dialectic of the communist movement
(8) and its substitution by idealism for which the world is "revolutionized"
by "revolutionaries". If reality really went that way, there wouldn't exist
any revolutionary possibility; if revolution depended really only on "revolutionaries",
then how can one possibly explain that will, consciousness, perseverance,
attitudes, steadfastness,... (all elements that are very relative and that
are so difficult for one or several groups to maintain during long periods
of counter-revolution, as proved by history) of those "revolutionaries"
will change the balance of forces as it exists today, in the way we described
before. For us, things are clear: the development of capital (and this
of course includes the development of counter-revolution) means the development
of all its contradictions: the limit of capital, is capital itself, and
its development necessarily implies the development of its own limits and
antagonisms, and it is all those material facts, and only them, that create
also the objective conditions allowing for man to change reality.
<p>This brings us back to the question or the "crisis". Without going into
any considerations about the meanings of the word all throughout the history
or communism and Marx's work, we can see that the editorial, instead of
taking this term in the contradictory sense we give it - the sharpening
of the contradictions and of the material determinations - simply refers
to this term in the way it is used by leftists and stalinists: in the sense
of increased misery that provokes revolution.
<p>The editorial's criticism of such vulgar and linear materialism, by
affirming that the crisis develops competition between proletarians and
this counter-revolution, was made from the same unilateral point of view
and only in terms of mere antithesis: as if capital had no limits, as if
the crisis didn't worsen the conditions for bourgeois domination (a ruling
class can maintain its rule only if it can present its project as the only
one, as the one that coincides with the interests of the whole of society!),
as if the crisis didn't turn every worker into a potential unemployed,
as if it didn't increase day after day the general discontent, as if it
didn't exarcebate the whole contradictory development of life.
<p>If we call "crisis" the sharpening of all the contradictions of capital
after the end of a phase of expansion that follows war (9) and if the "crisis"
each time more explosive during its cycles that always repeat and develop
themselves until covering all countries, we can see the absurdity of the
central thesis of "l'Europe des Versaillais": crisis is neither an automatic
weapon of revolution nor of counter-revolution, as claims the editorial.
It was the sharpening of all social contradictions that provoked the wave
of struggles of the second half of the sixties, but at the same time this
has produced an increase in competition to which the article refers in
a unilateral manner. The development of the pole of revolution and the
pole of counter-revolution, not only simultaneously but also, sometimes,
in a cyclical way (one after the other) or even successively, is proper
to the crisis (10).
<p>The best explanation of all this, is war. War is the most important
concretisation of the crisis of capital (11). War materializes all the
contradictions of capitalist society because it means the progression of
counter-revolution (that is only possible through war) but, at the same
time, as we've witnessed all throughout the revolutionary history of our
class, war produces revolution. The most important revolutionary proletarian
struggles of history up until now have been struggles against capital at
war. That is to say that the affirmations in the editorial about the crisis
not only fall in the idealistic antithesis of mecanist materialism, but
also ignore the abc of dialectics: contradiction within unity, the being
creating its own negation. Even more so, once the social determinism has
been ignored and once the transformation of society is imagined according
to the ideas of "revolutionaries", they then "return to society" and blame
the proletariat for its condition as an exploited class. "Above all, what
really seems to matter today, is to make one's existence depend on the
existence of production, to make one's survival depend on the survival
of our exploiters, i.e. what is dominating today is the supposed community
of interest between each individual proletarian and capitalist economy."
Who could this phrase refer to if not to the proletariat itself. Here the
cult of the individual reaches the extreme: it talks about the proletarians
who "make their existence depend on the existence of production, their
survival on the survival or their exploiters", as if this was a voluntary
option amongst others, and not - as it is in reality - the central social
determination of the proletariat as a class. This determinatlon can only
be destroyed through the self-destruction of the proletariat, through social
revolution. The point is not that such or such individual "makes his existence
depend on the existence of his exploiters" (which is always true in this
society), even so for revolted individual: but the point is that up to
its self-suppression, the proletariat will only survive on the basis of
the enlarged reproduction of capital (what else is alienation about!).
<p>To conclude, we can see why the editorial of our previous review in
french is a perfect little recipe to make a good idealistic soup. In crisis,
it only sees counter-revolution; the proletariat is only defined by the
pole of non-struggle; the communist minorities are the only carriers of
communism; class struggle doesn't exist anymore (in Europe). So then, we
just have to leave it up to those who have "understood" (consciousness)
and/or those who "want" another world. This way the party defined by these
pure categories of thought, becomes just a structure to be constructed
brick after brick and that will turn up like a new messiah whenever, at
last, workers will decide to start moving!
<p>Negating the determinations that make this centralising unique and worldwide
force surge up "from the soil of modern society" (Marx) and reducing all
this to facts of will and consciousness, leads in one way or another, to
the idea of a party to be built up and where the individual presents himself
as the only guarantee of the revolution. One of the characteristics of
the counter-revolution is to present the individual as the unique guarantee
of the truth.
<p>"It's in those moments... that the old and lifeless molecule called
"individual" covers itself with a kind of crust called consciousness and
begins to chatter claiming it will go wherever and whenever it wants to
go, raising its immeasurable stupidity to become the supposed motive power,
the causal subject of history". (Bordiga)
<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">Errors and guarantees against them</font></u></h2>
We already can hear our enemies shout: "It's a scandal! This group isn't
serious, it first publishes a position and later on criticizes it, this
shows a lack of guarantee for the struggle!!!". But also, there will be
militants, groups, readers, who struggle with us against capital, comrades,
who will ask the same question: "Can we still place our confidence in this
group after this kind of error? Will such a group be able to lead the proletarian
struggle tomorrow?". We address our answer only to our comrades of course:
our press isn't addressed to the others and we don't owe them any explanations.
<p>In the face of an error such as the publication of the editorial criticized
here, there can only be one kind of proletarian answer that expresses the
solidarity of the comrades who see in such weakness also the weakness of
the class, the weakness of the present theoretical expression of the struggle,
as well as of the modest attemps of international centralisation.
<p>Let's now get to the centre of the problem: about the passed, present
and future guarantees. We've said it many times: no statutes, no formal
rules, no administrative procedures, no leaders as genius as they may be,
can possibly constitute a guarantee against errors. The guarantee can only
be found in our programmatical coherence. But such a fundamental affirmation
is not sufficient, f.i. it does not allow us to decide which text to publish,
and whether to publish it.
<p>There are two ways to never criticize oneself, to never criticize a
text: to approuve unanimously everything to be published and thus to never
put back into question something that has already been published, because
it has become sacred. The other way, more caricatural, which is "Programme"'s
formula (Parti Communiste International) who explains the change in positions
by... a mistake by the reader (cfr. "The reader might have understood that...
but in fact we meant that..."). In all these cases, we are in the andst
of democracy!
<p>Against this, we've organised, within the group, the centralised discussion
and criticism of all the published material. And we are not talking here
about formal criticisms that would consist in defining praisingly "the
big step forward made by our group" but we talk about discussions, criticisms
that aim at finding the weaknesses, recognising them and above all, rectifying
them!
<p>We try of course to improve as much as possible the quality of our publications
and to reinforce our activities. To do this, the only solution we have
found is our programmatical reinforcement, the international and theoretical
discussion and homogeneisation within the precise framework and limits
decided by the international central structures of our group and applied
in each case and in each publication by a "responsible dictator". And we
want to stress here that for us such a "responsible dictator" never is
a simple delegate of the rank and file or of a local group as this is the
case for federalist and democratic groups, but on the contrary, he is responsible
for the central coherence and for the communist orientations. Concerning
this "responsible dictator" we have strongly been influenced by the explicit
and openly assumed dictatorship claimed by Marx and Engels as the only
way to run a journal. "The editing was organised by Marx. A big daily paper
that must be finished at a set time cannot ensure the continuation and
consistency of positions without such an organisation. But more than this,
in our case, Marx' dictatorship imposed itself incontestably and it was
willingly recognised by all of us." (Engels)
<p>It is true that publishing our central reviews doesn't imply the same
requirements as for a daily paper; our group publishes reviews in different
languages, written by comrades in several countries between which communication
is slow and difficult. Anyway, we consider that there is only one way of
assuming such a task: to never leave any uncertainty about the fact that,
in the end, the responsibility of the decision must be CONCENTRATED AND
CENTRALISED.
<p>Maybe the word "dictatorial" will seem repellent. But we must never
forget that it is the most powerful and bloodthirsty force of the dictatorship
of capital (democracy, commodity production, value, money) that always
presents itself as the expression of man's will. "Dictatorship", "dictatorial",...
are words rejected by bourgeois humanism to better disguise the essence
of its class-domination. This domination is clearly based on the dictatorial
law that implies that whoever is not working, must starve! For us anyway,
independently from the humanitarian titles it takes to better hide its
worldwide bourgeois character, the capitalist dictatorship recovers the
bloodthirsty domination of money which, as a commodity, exerts itself violently
against our class.
<p>We ourselves, just like Marx and Engels, prefer to call things by their
rightful name. The dictatorship of the proletariat cannot be exerted without
contradictions and this also implies the possibility to come in contradiction
with the wishes or the will of other proletarians. There exist no other
"communist" form of centrality but the organic one in which the organicity
of the whole imposes itself (through its corresponding concretizations)
against the free will of each particularity (12).
<p>So, when we refer to such or such a comrade as a "responsible dictator"
for such or such a task, we do not refer to some kind of bourgeois "leader"
who must be feared and respected to avoid his terrible fits of anger, but
we refer to comrades who are permanently showing their capacities in the
struggle we lead against this society, and as such, they have won our confidence
in their ability to guarantee the appropriateness of such or such action,
publication, decision,... and this way they also express the results of
our activities, of our struggle. All this has nothing to do with the adulation
of some "remarkable proletarian chief" nor with the sanctification of such
or such a text. Quite to the contrary, the capacity to be at the "avant-garde"
of the proletariat expresses itself also through the fact of being able
to call back into question the way things have been expressed before, expressions
that often remain marked with concessions to bourgeois ideology. The whole
strenght of Marx was to question what he had stated about the "progressive"
bourgeoisie in 1848; and it was the strength of Lenin to reject what he
had defended about the possibility of a pacific revolution in september
1917.
<p>The fact that the editorial called "l'Europe des Versaillais" has been
published in our review, is related to our way of organisation in the group,
based on confidence and responsibility. If we have developped our criticisms
of the editorial inside our group before making them public, this is due
to the fact that we always push all our comrades and contacts to criticize
everything we publish, and we then centralize these criticisms: this way
we put these criticisms in the service of the revolutionary struggle. We
proceed exactly in the same way when we criticize the weaknesses of working-class
struggles because these weaknesses necessarily hinder our constitution
into force. Our reviews are part of the centralisation of our activities,
and such centralisation cannot be paralysed by the stupid democratism proper
to leftist groups and to the centrist organisations of the so-called "revolutionary
milieu". Their democratic centralism gives the illusion that all militants
participate in the decision-making (and old social-democratic myth, that
is nothing else but a "workers"' version of the bourgeois principle of
popular sovereignty and of universal suffrage!) while in fact the real
decisions are taken in small committees end behind the back of those who're
stupid enough to consent to such masquerades! (13)
<p>Our centralism is organic, i.e. the necessity of the struggle, of our
programme, of workers' associationism implies a high level of confidence
between revolutionaries, which is not based on the faith in some "genius
leader", but only on the militant practice that we all have in common and
that is continuously being reinforced through permanent criticism.
<p>Within a revolutionary group, to decide means and implies responsibilities,
in the most direct sense of the word: responsibilities in the face of comrades,
in the face of the class, and it is on the basis of this responsibility
and of mutual confidence at all levels - from the writing of a single text
(that tries to express the clearest level of abstraction, and this is the
result of our collective experience) up to the dictatorial responsibility
for each one of our publications - that the historical and international
centralisation of our activities organises itself without any bureaucratic
control.
<p>Each time a comrade writes a text - result and synthesis of the discussions
inside the group - we do not bring it before a democratic court gathering
all our comrades! NO!! We have confidence in the comrade's ability to synthesize
the experience drawn from discussions and from the whole of the group's
activity and we leave him the care to decide whether and how an article
must be published (15). If the latter publishes a text that's going against
our programmatical experiences, he will of course be criticized or even
sanctionned; this was the case with the editorial of "Le Communiste" No25.
We're aiming at the fact that more and more all militants recognize themselves
in the centralised initiatives of other comrades and this may imply the
need for very hard decisions against those who break with this confidence
by their irresponsabilities. Of course, our practice, that aims at organic
centralism, sometimes complicates our organisational efforts and "explains"
such mistakes as the one we're criticizing here (16). It would be much
easier to reduce our activity to a translation of texts of some "leader"
and so, to play the show of an internationalist organisation, just like
stalinist groups do. We prefer the "risk" of organicity, but not so because
we might have some kind of choice between different kind of conception
of the struggle, but because the communist movement, its aims, its programme,
its means, its methods,... imply relationships between men that are not
based on servile obedience to chiefs, on monkeys following the director
of the circus like little dogs, or on the division of the work between
those who think and those who write or translate, between intellectuals
and manual workers, etc. In our group each militant must become the carrier
of the totality, this means at the same time tending to be able to assume
all tasks, and, on the other hand - knowing it is impossible to do everything
- that each moment of his activity containns the totality of the project
of the abolition of classes.
<p>This is how the terrible contradiction that the bourgeoisie never ceases
to put forward (in its efforts to "reason" the world - that-is to say,
to impose and submit it to its Reason! can be and tends to be resolved:
we are talking about the contradiction between "freedom" and "necessity"
whose score has been settled for good by Marx who opposed to the "free"
individual with its golden chains, the proletariat as it has, is and will
always be historically constrained to act according to its being. Our decisions
derive neither from democratic consultations nor from blind obedience;
they derive from the history of our class and from our own experience within
this history.
<p>Therefore we can only insist on the necessity to understand that the
sole and unique way to concretize our programmatical coherence is through
the permanent care for criticism and the centralisation of this criticism.
In a famous text against religion Marx defined the power of the critical
attitude and activity. But those who think that this definition of criticism
applies itself only to churches and priests, forget that everything that
is tending to stop moving, to congeal... transforms itself into religion.
It is normal that groups like the International Communist Party or the
ICC transform themselves into sects, the former's activity for years has
been defined from the fateful date of 1975 that should have sounded the
knell of worldwide revolution, while the latter masturbates itself about
the confirmation of "the right line developed by the Xth Congress" concerning
the fourth wave of struggle etc.
<p>May the proletarians, deceived by those group's easy stories and impressed
by their scientific nonsense, look in a critical way into reality and they'll
soon realize that beyond the difficulty of destroying the illusions of
the idea of revolution with which those centrists recruit workers, the
biggest social deflagration the world has ever known is preparing itself.
We don't need all those who never stop talking about their "idea" of communism.
We need revolutionaries hardened in the heat of criticism, able to maintain,
against the current, the organisation of all expressions of struggle against
this world, and hence, also able to criticize themselves.
<p>"Criticism has plucked the imaginary flowers on the chain not in order
that man shall continue to bear that chain without fantasy or consolation
but so that he shall throw off the chain and pluck the living flowers."
(Marx -Critique of Hegel's Philosophy of Right).
<p>Permanent criticism and self-criticism are demonstrations of our class'
force. They do not aim at opposing some arguments against others. Criticism
is the genuine movement of destruction of the old world. Therefore it has
nothing to do whatsoever with the various debates of ideas proposed by
well respected leftists. The whole history of the proletariat is based
on the lessons it has been able to draw from the errors of the past; communist
criticism isn't based on the idea that there would be a world to convince
with a load of "communist" arguments, but only on the destruction of capital
through organisation of the movement of the abolition of classes "like
it is really happening before our eyes".
<p>"Criticism is not a passion of the head but the head of passion. It
is not a scalpel but a weapon. Its object is its enemy, which it aims not
to refute but to destroy" (Marx - Ibid.).
<p>To conclude, we call upon the comrades who read us to help us improve
our publications, to participate in the real criticisms between members
of the same class, propulsed by the same movement to destroy this old world.
On several occasions we have received such criticism from proletarians
who really care to help our group to go forward. We insist to receive other
contributions. These comrades who send their excellent criticisms, are
the living expression that our publications are not "private" but, on the
contrary, are the collective product of a class that is living and struggling,
and of whom the Internationalist Communist Group is only an organ of centralisation.
<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">Proletariat against the individual (19)</font></u></h2>
The central and never-changing characteristic of idealism is to define
reality as something pure and perfect. Whatever form it may take (councilism,
bordigism, leninism,...) idealism never conceives the revolutionary "solution"
starting of from the very decomposition of capital (the revolutionary action
of the proletariat is this same decomposition changed into its positive
negation.)
<p>Idealism is incapable of discerning the limits of capital in capital
itself. That's why, according to all those reformers of the old world,
they have to define the pure redeeming being that from the outside of the
real world, from the outside of capitalist putrefaction, will come to the
rescue of workers by telling them what to do! According to Lenin it is
bourgeois intellectuals that constitute the force - the Party - that will
import consciousness from the outside into our class.
<p>The idealist deviation of "blanquism" was expressed by the fact that
they also conceived their activities as an outward intervention by a group,
a nucleus of very determined combattants carrying out revolution on behalf
of the proletariat.
<p>In the editorial that we've just criticised in the previous chapter,
we can find these same saviours of the working class, those men who define
themselves as "pure" communists, the unique origin of revolution. So whatever
form they may take, idealists (making revolution rise from the outside
of the movement of putrefaction and decomposition of capitalist society)
always conceive and define the tasks of communists as being determined
only by their own will and consciousness. But since - according to idealists
- communists must be related in one way orr another to the working-class
(since the working-class has to be educated, has to be convinced of the
need for revolution) so they create the forms of organization "for the
masses", they make speeches according to what the workers are ready to
accept, they publish "open letters" for those who are not yet ready to
follow them, they create different structures wherever they can find proletarians
so as to stimulate their consciousness... and, in the end, they only reform
society. It is logical, from the point of view of those for whom the proletariat
does not exist any longer as the class historically determined to violently
impose communism, that for them the only subject of revolution would be
those pure beings, defined through their consciousness and their will,
and who act in order "to show the road to revolution" or still "to reinforce
- progressively - communism wherever it allready exists!" In this understanding,
communist militants are identified with the class and have become themselves
the movement. But the reduction of the class to only those who are willing
to fight (consciousness!) betrays an individualist - anti-social, anti-historical
- conception of class-struggle. Since the  very beginning of our group's
existence, we've always affirmed that a class can neither be defined "statically"
(without movement) or "sociologically" through the place individual workers
take up in the immediate process of production, nor by the idea individuals
may have about themselves, by what they are thinking or imagining... but
can only be defined by the social and historical conditions that determine
the proletariat to impose its own social project.
<p>The proletariat, while being completely excluded from society where
it only has its labour-force to cash in on, finds itself at the center
of all material production in society, and it is this contradictory situation
that pushes it to become the acting negator of the capitalist social relationship.
It is in the proletarian condition that both, the complete capitalist dehumanization
as well as the revolutionary struggle against this dehumanization, exist.
The being that bears this tremendous historical and social determination,
is the proletariat. For the proletariat, the necessity and the possibility
to overthrow this system and to establish a human communist society, are
one and the same!
<p>On this subject also, our position differs radically as well from those
who defend the workers-condition as from those who, although they criticize
workerism, nevertheless reproduce the same shit by adopting its pure anti-thesisk,
i.e. the defence of the abstract individual ("the fighter", "the communist")
and his freedom, his choices, where all references to the historical and
material conditions that determine our class to revolt itself, will have
disappeared.
<p>Even if the more "revolted" and more "voluntary" individuals (as they
are defined by classical idealism) are also part of the revolutionary class,
nevertheless they are only part of it, a contingent and immediate expression
of it, and they do not represent the proletariat constituted as a revolutionary
class. Of course, revolt, the refusal of submission, are at the basis of
all struggle, but it is wrong to restrict the communist movement to a simple
"revolt" (or even more so to "moral" revolt!). As we've already stated,
communism is a movement of which the determinations go far back in time,
in the histoy of class-societies. And these historical determinations (f.i.
the attitude in front of the State) are much larger than the narrow framework
(and the narrow perspectives that derive from this) of individual revolt
against the ignominy of our situation as an "immediate class".
<p>Communists organise themselves and direct their class and their struggles
not to defend the partial interests of certain fringes of the proletariat,
but to defend its general interests, the general aim of its movement. All
their activities (and therefore those who they appeal to) are determined
according to this goal. Such activities require a voluntary, conscient,
organised, practical break with all immediatism, with all voluntarism...
"to make the proletariat move"... "to organise oneself at all costs, no
matter the perspectives"...!!! In this effect, our activities have nothing
to do neither with those "who know" or "who wait" nor with those "who refuse".
Because what we have here, is a very voluntary appreciation (only those
who have the cultural, intellectual, material means to "refuse" can do
so during a period of social peace f.i.) and this, as such, does not constitute
a social force. "Refusal" is contingent, linked up above all to the particular
nature of individuals and not to the essential universality of the proletarian
condition.
<p>The class situation of the proletariat is a contradictory situation
that pushes it, often in spite of itself and in spite of the immediate
consciousness it may have about the struggle it is launching (that's also
why the organised, conscious, voluntary activities of direction assumed
by communist minorities struggling for the internationalist centralization
of the struggle, are so important!) to revolt itself against its condition
as an exploited class. This struggle is a first step towards a reversal
of the situation, towards a negation of the contradictory conditions that
determine the proletariat. But such a reversal is dialectical and not statical
or gradual. The positivist conception sees communism as a positive out-growth
that already throws out its roots in the capitalist mode of production,
developing itself within its bosom, and finally superseding it.
<p>It is the whole question of reification, of the dynamic of the struggle,
of the reversal of praxis and therefore also the whole question of the
party that is being dodged by this "theory" of revolt. It is the anarchist
ideology with its logic of individual struggle (cfr. Bonnot, Ravachol,...)
that corresponds to this worship of revolt. For communists, even when there
exist no open revolts, when the proletarians have abandonned the struggle
and return back within the realm of democracy, nevertheless the fundamental
antagonisms of capital do not disappear. We do not send back to back the
proletarians (even when atomised) and the State, we do not send back to
back for instance the workers in Poland when they returned to work and
Walesa, or the english miners and Scargill!
<p>The whole militant activity of the Party-Marx (against Proudhon, against
Lasalle, against Bakounin) in order to bring to light the "real social
condition of the proletariat", the "fundamental causes that have provoked
the misery and the exploitation of the proletariat", the whole criticism
of political economy that has allowed for our Party to practically show
"that the class struggle necessarily leads to the dictatorship of the proletariat,
and that this dictatorship itself is only a transition toward the suppression
of all classes" is being denied by the anarchist and individualist conception
that places the individual - and not a social class - at the centre of
the struggle against this society. We are here at the heart of the marxist
critique of capitalist society, as it opposes itself historically to the
"utopian" and idealist currents.
<p>Individualism is much more than just a theoretical poison produced by
today's situation of proletarian withdrawal. Individualism is a practice.
And this counter-revolutionary practice also attacks the communist movement.
Revolutionary organizations are not save from this terrible reality. Actually,
it would be more right to say that a revolutionary organization means the
permanent struggle against the narrow-minded trust each one puts in himself
just too easily. More than once, we've met comrades who just could not
accept a real contradictory debate and who, in the face of criticisms,
preferred to break with the organization so as to recover their sacred
liberty of thought and action. Of course, these breaks were always justified
because of "programmatical disagreements" but what really prevailed each
time was the refusal of the contradiction and the will to be all alone
with ones consciousness without having to render any account to anybody
except oneself or to some monkeys that accept to play the game.
<p>One can find the ideology of the individual in the Bakouninist theory
of the organization within the organization (20). We ourselves have suffered
from such disorganizing practices within the ICG. Its theory bases itself
on the idea that the struggle for the Party, the struggle for the internationalist
centralization of our forces, would be a permanent struggle of "fractions".
But a confusion is being introduced here between the historical activities
of the communist left fractions in order to break with counter-revolutionary
organizations... and a practice of sect that consists, within a communist
organization, in the gathering of the "masses" around oneself, on the basis
of ones' own ideas!
<p>The heart of the contradiction that, from rupture to rupture, allows
for a communist organization to move forward, is not - in the end - the
debate of ideas; it really is the clash between practical differences.
Therefore one cannot on the one hand claim organic centralism and on the
other hand create an organization within the organization so as to fight
against the different decisions of the organization, while pretending that
this is part of the historical practice of the communist fractions.
<p>We have to denounce very clearly this practice of the organization within
the organization (theorized by Bakounin) against which Marx has always
fought. The tactics of the organization within the organization, of occult
direction, of hidden authoritarianism... leads directly to federalism as
a political conception. Marx has always denounced this classical idealist
pretention to establish beforehand a formal elite supposedly guaranteeing
the revolution. One can easily find this kind of conception with Kautsky,
with Lenin, and even more so, with Stalin, Zinoviev and Bordiga. The individualist
postulate that starts off from the idea that ones' own ideas are right,
and therefore that all means (fractionism, federalism, lies,...) are also
right in order to impose these ideas, is a reactionary postulate, a postulate
of sectarism.
<p>This has nothing to do with organic centralism! And only our practical
attitudes, our practical activities allow us to check the ideas one may
claim to have about organic centralism. Against all individualists, we
reaffirm here that in communist organizations there is not any more liberty
for fractionism than there is for the circulation of ideas. The constitution
of a fraction within an organization and that leads necessarily to a break
with this organization and to the constitution of another organization,
is not a question of liberty, but of necessity, and such a necessity can
only be justified in the case of a break with counter-revolution. But the
aim of fractionism, of anti-organizational practices, or federalism, of
the organization within the organization... and all this within a communist
group, is not to clarify the contradictions and debates, but rather to
drown them, to hide and to obscure the opposed practices behind debates
about ideas!
<p>So, what's really at stake here is not the struggle against counter-revolution
but the struggle against revolution! Such sectarian and individualist logic
that manages to scuttle so many of the real efforts to centralise the revolutionary
forces today, can only result in the myth of the man of genius!
<p>Its logic is quite simple: since - according to this theory - the invariant
task of communists is to guarantee the communist positions by way of the
fraction inside the organization, so one soon arrives at the need for the
fraction inside the fraction... and in the end one arrives at the individual,
the leader! It is clear to us that in reality this kind of logic can only
lead to one thing: the reproduction of democracy with behind it its whole
load of bureaucrats and followers. Since the real starting point here is
the individual with his brains... so their can be no doubt about the means
that will be used to impose his views: any means will do, including lies,...
<p>It is clear to communist militants that only collective activity, the
organization and the respect of programmatical discipline that materialize
itself also in organizational discipline (21), the permanent confrontation
in struggle... are the only ways that allow us to check constantly the
progress in our fight against this society of the bourgeois individual
with his bourgeois freedom! Sectarianism and individualism within a revolutionary
organization must be firmly opposed because they destroy the confidence
between militants, and this confidence can only result from the fraternal
critique of the activities we have in common. Of course it's always much
easier to put forward just any disagreement and to try to assemble some
followers! (If a fraction had to be constituted for each disagreement that
exists, necessarily, in a group, for sure there would at least exist 10
fractions for each militant!).
<p>Sectarianism inside an organization necessarily reproduces free thought,
the individual, division of labour (between those who've understood and
the others),... reproduces democracy! It is much more difficult, but also
much more passionate, to affirm our contradictions while putting forward
what is really uniting us as members of the same community of struggle
against the State. Revolutionaries are not philosophers that compete for
a prize. Communism surges up from the real historical and material determinations;
consciousness can only be the necessary product of a movement, of a force
that rises spontaneously from and within history, from the soil of modern
capitalist society. Consciousness is not the motorforce of history, with
all due deference to idealists! Only the proletariat, while confronting
its enemy, while organising itself as an international and centralised
force, while constituting itself as a party, is the real subject of history!
<p>Once more we want to ecpress our hatred of the democratic individual.
Once more we want to express our hatred in front of this miserable bourgeois
chimera with its scientist pretentions that always and everywhere rises
up again to destroy the real links of class' interests that unite revolutionaries
all over the world!
<p>To the individualists and to the worshippers of consciousness, we oppose
our certitudes about the revolution, our determination to struggle and
our efforts to act for the affirmation of what is uniting us, proletarians,
who try to constitute an organ of struggle that is an integral part of
the historical communist movement that incorporates us and transcends us!
<p>Free of everything, i.e. not possessing anything, free even to believe
that he can do whatever he wants to, the individual, in the end, is nothing
else but a commodity that sublimates itself by presenting the laws of free
circulation that govern him, as the result of his own free and personal
choices. He refuses to see that these laws have been imposed on him by
the bourgeois in order to create the market or labour-forces. Free to be
exploited by whoever he wants to, the individual simply "forgets" that
this liberty is synonymous of his own exploitation and nothing else!
<p>For us proletarians who know that we have nothing to win from this world
of commodities, the individual is and always will be a traitor to our class,
a scab, an enemy!
<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">Conclusion</font></u></h2>
By bringing these clarifications in this editorial, we only address ourselves
to our class and to its militants. We are not answerable to any kind of
"revolutionary milieu". Let things be clear: we denounce this "milieu"
for the baleful part it takes in the present situation. We despise this
milieu, and in particular its democratism and its pacifism. This democratism
and pacifism only recently revealed itself once more with the recent initiative
by the International Bureau for the Revolutionary Party and some other
groups as well, to create a front, a publication because... "what matters
today is to react in a more unitarian way to the repression that the different
constituent groups of the revolutionary milieu have to endure" while it
is clear that - since always tens and tens of thousands of communist militants
(who do not belong to the european revolutionary milieu" it is true) are
massacred, tortured, emprisoned, kidnapped... all over the world!
<p>There can be no 2 programmes, one for communists and another one for
proletarians! We do not cooperate with our enemies, and of course those
are our enemies who on the one hand spit on the thousands of proletarians
that Capital is keeping as hostages in its sinister cages, while proposing
on the other hand the common resistence of "communist militants" against
the State. Misery of idealism! This means that those groups are ready "to
offer" their miserable solidarity only to those who they consider to be
"communists". To put forward such ideological categories, stands in opposition
to the invariant attitude of communists that has always been, for instance
in the case of the communist left in Italiy, to manifest their solidarity
with all those who fight against the State. That's how the italian left
used to proclaim its solidarity with persecuted anarchists and "terrorists".
<p>As we've been trying to show all along this article, it is idealism
that is at the basis of all the distorsions of our positions operated by
our detractors, whether they once belonged to our group or not. Idealism
considers "the idea", "consciousness" to be the first determinations of
action; it makes the idea of communism dominate on the real communist movement.
And this is not justa mistake, a theoretical error, but it is first of
all a practice, a totality that is entirely in contradiction with our militant
activities! The idealist conception that is at the basis of all the deviations
that we've mentioned, reinforces the anti-organisational practices. And
it is those practices, those anti-militant forces, transcending the reality
of our own existence as a group, that we have to fight without respite.
This editorial constitutes another link of this struggle.
<p>The internal fights against the whole of these anti-militant practices
have seriously delayed the activities of our group. During the last year
especially, we've lived a real phase of difficulties concerning he centralisation
of our main tasks. For more than a year, we've had to fight against this
stupid practice that takes the idea of communism, the idea of the party
as the real starting point!
<p>This is why as well the general "thesis of orientation" that we intended
to publish, as the publication in different languages of our central reviews,
have seriously been delayed. This real decentralisation of our activities
constitute a weakness that we must now transform: to do this we'll use
- by the publication of different texts -  the lessons we draw from the
struggles and debates that have animated the life of our group for the
last few years.
<p>For us, in any case, the struggle continues, and the idealist line whose
promoters have now been excluded from our group, will at least have allowed
us to make another step in the clear derinition and the necessary breaking
from centrism, this counter-revolutionary force that appears in the guise
of communism, but that in reality is just another attempt to destroy from
the inside through anti-party activism - the necessary revolutionary centralisation!
<p>An expression of the idealist line excluded from our organisation materialized
itself through the publication of the article "L'Europe des Versaillais"
in "Le Communiste" No25 and that we've criticized in this editorial. One
can find another expression of this same idealist line in a pamphlet "Split
with the ICG" that is being published, with our material help, by some
other militants excluded from our group. We strongly recommend the lecture
of this pamphlet because it expresses wonderfully well the idealist deviation
we're criticizing. The first ones say we're bureaucrats and leninists,
the latter say we're modernists and anarchists. We can only propose them
to go and play their game of ideological ping-pong together. For sure,
lots of tables remain vacant in the "revolutionary milieu".

<h3>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">Notes</font></u></h3>
(1) All the examples described in this editorial come from our french-language
review, because it's through this review, and mainly through this language,
that most of the problems and contradictions (that have led to the exclusion
of the comrade in charge of this publication) have been cristallised for
the last few years. This is due to the fact that french is the language
of most of our comrades and it is understood by almost all of the group,
thus it is the only possibility for arabic speaking comrades to discuss
with spanish speaking comrades. On the other hand, for the moment, the
main countries of the group's presence are countries where french is the
first language (a text published in french is criticised much quicker than
a text published in spanish, in english or in arabic). The eruption of
these contradictions mainly through "Le Communiste" - central review in
french of the Internationalist Communist Group - is also due to the fact
that the comrades who assumed the responsability of this review have shown
on different occasions:
<p>- insufficient breaking off from this society in general and from what
in Europe claims itself to be the "revolutionary milieu" in particular.
This expressed itself particularly through the publication of texts that
did not convey the general level of agreement developped by the group against
this "milieu" as against its predecessor: social democracy! These texts
only were shy criticisms of such centrist groups as the International Communist
Party, the Internationalist Communist Current, and so on.
<p>- real difficulties of these comrades to forge and assume our collective
discipline.
<p>(2) An explanation of this is the publication of those texts in which,
far from trying to reflect the group's positions, the responsible comrade
published his own positions and to do this, he used dupery and swindle!
<p>(3) Internal discussions have allowed us to criticize this position
and to centrally decide a change that expresses itself by the fact that
the spanish version doesn't contain such an aberration: thus we affirm
once more that what really makes the difference between proletariat and
bourgeoisie, is the necessity of struggle against alienation and against
all of capitalist domination. (cfr. "Comunismo" No22, p.18)
<p>(4) Here it seems important to stress the same expressions Marx uses
against the most subtile and developed theorizations of idealism: the humanist
"materialism" or the young hegelians. It still is today the most developed
philosophical expression (conscious or not) of the apology of the human
being and of the individual.
<p>(5) We won't be able to respect this decision in a near future because
the comrades who could carry it through, do no longer belong to our group
for the reasons explained in this text.
<p>(6) We use the word "sectarian" not in the sense of the total opposition
and the entire independence of the proletariat to this society, but on
the contrary, in reference to the traditional meaning of the word as it
refers to religious sects. Sectarian is the practice of groups that base
their activities on "the politics of differences" and that have no other
activities but to defend the social system they've builded up in their
mind.
<p>(7) The readers who understand french, can ask us and we'll send them
"Le Communiste" No25 and 26.
<p>(8) In this sense the editorial of "Le Communiste" No25 is in total
contradiction with the quote published on the front page of the review:
"For us communism isn't a state that has to be created nor an ideal according
to which reality should adapt itself; we call communism the real movement
that abolishes the established order. The conditions of this movement result
from factors existing today." (Marx - German ldeology)
<p>(9) In opposition to this use, the word "crisis" can be used in a much
more generic and abstract and/or much more specific sense. Indeed, even
if today the crisis is referred to mostly in the economic sense of the
word (in opposition to the "political" crisis - i.e. in the sense of the
crisis of domination of one bourgeois fraction or of the whole bourgeoisie
- or in opposition to the "social" crisis  - i.e. in the sense of the crisis
of a social system as a whole - or still in opposition to the "revolutionary"
crisis in the sense of a social and/or political crisis with the possibility
for the revolutionary class to resolve this crisis in a revolutionary way)
we must stress that for Marx the word "crisis" recovers different things:
from the general contradictions of Capital itself (- and in this sense
Capital is, right from its birth and until its death, in a state of permanent
crisis -) till the end of a cycle of expansion that ends in a depression
and, in this sense, the word "crisis" has a much more contingent meaning
(short cycle of 8 or 10 years that coincides with the rotation of fixed
capital).
<p>(10) A good example is the period preceeding the insurrection of 1917.
<p>(11) It is in the most extreme situations that the contradictions within
the unity (one being) become the clearest.
<p>(12) Despite all the problems and risks contained by the following parallelism,
we'll take an example in the sphere of biology: the necessity of the organic
body to be fed which is imposed by the digestive system without any democratic
consultation between your big toe and your right ear! The necessities of
the whole (our organic body) are never represented by the addition of its
different atoms!
<p>(13) A typical example of this are the huge congresses of workers' associations
where hundreds and thousands of delegates talk about everything and nothing...
to applaud in the end, as a great resolution, something that had been decided
a long time before by... some leaders!
<p>(14) Contrary to democratic centralism where each decision taken by
a majority also means an approbation for those who are right - as if having
the majority could be a valuable criteria! In communist centralism, a decision
and its execution never imply in any way a judgment on the contents of
the discussions. If there exist disagreements, the discussions will continue
(in spite of the decision taken!) and develop themselves and the duty of
the central structures of the organisation will be to stimulate this. Only
further discussions and their centralisation will allow to check the decision
and, if necessary, to criticize and change it.
<p>(15) We cannot see any other way to set up an international proletarian
structure and to have it assume the programmatical centralisation in spite
of the necessity for a real geographical decentralisation, for an increase
in publications in different languages and countries, and with the impossibility
for easy communication and therefore in the absence of regular international
discussions!
<p>(16) Many times our enemies have reproached us the differences of position
existing between our central reviews. Obviously this kind of problem doesn't
exist in social democratic or stalinist organisations that only recognize
a formal centre and where the different sections limit their activities
to the translation of the already existing articles while they themselves
only write articles about local problems. To us it seems unavoidable -
in view of the general state of weak centralization that characterizes
today's struggles -that all vanguard forces should reproduce, in one way
or another, these same problems of international centralization. Those
who think they are so superior to us and to the proletariat in general
(indeed, do they not pretend to have solved already in their heads what
the proletariat hasn't managed to solve yet in reality!) only sow confusion
and serve the counter-revolution.
<p>(17) As we've already stated, idealism is the perfect complement of
vulgar materialism: for example, the idea of the external saviour, the
party of bourgeois intellectuals,... is complementary to the social-economic
and anti-party understanding of the proletarian class.
<p>(19) We use the word "individual" in reference to the atom-citizen of
bourgeois society, essential component of democracy! We use this term in
the sense of the contingent individual, as it is subsumed by a class of
society... and as it is historically opposed to the personal individual,
the human being, component of a real community of struggle and of needs.
<p>(20) cfr. the "Programme of international brotherhood" that was written
in 1872 by Bakounin. It is one of the texts in which Bakounin defined his
federalist strategy of the "organisation within the organisation": occult
direction, construction of the Party from the top, hidden authoritarianism,
different speeches in public and in private, different tactics inside the
organisation, internationalism assumed only by the top of the pyramid,...
<p>(21) We want to insist here on the organizational materializations of
this discipline, because today, while all anti-organizational theories
are more than ever in fashion, the anti-organizational practices also find
their ideological justification in some kind of mystical discipline towards
the "historical programme" and such an "historical framework" of course
never takes a concrete and practical form but always remains locked up
in the realm of the idea, of hegelian speculative philosophy.

states</font></font></h1></center>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">* <font size=+4>*</font> *</font></h1></center>
The media are extremely effective tools for moulding world public opinion,
and are basic instruments of cretinisation used at all levels of society
in the interests of world capitalism. What they call "terrorism" are acts
of violence against persons or things, the responsibility for which are
not claimed by states they consider legitimate.
<p>They do not describe as terrorism:
<ul>
<li>
state terrorism, the terrorism of their "own" government,</li>

<li>
or the terrorism of allied governments, or even that of states of the opposite
bloc that they consider legitimate,</li>

<li>
and most of all, the permanent, generalised terrorism of the police, justice,
prisons, the factories, the trade unions, the armed forces, the systematic
"disappearance" of militants, psychiatric hospitals, etc...</li>
</ul>
All these kinds of terrorism, directed against the population of the whole
planet, who are deprived of and separated from the essentials of life and
the means of production by private property and wage labour, are not considered
to be terrorism. These are examples of "natural", "legitimate" violence;
the monopoly of violence "against chaos". Under the reign of the ruling
ideology, the bourgeoisie and its ideologists, for example journalists
and sociologists, do not even have to say that state terrorism is not terrorism.
This "truth" is a religious one, institutionalised and reinforced by the
"religion" characteristic of the whole of world capitalist society. It
is "natural" in this society, as natural as the fact that in a slave society,
a slave is not a human being but a mere object.
<p>Nothing is more "natural" for this system than millions of people terrorised
into starvation by forces of repression, deprived of the power to get their
hands on the means of subsistence. Nothing is more "natural" for this terrorist
society than the fact that the cannibalistic application of human rights
to combative proletarians is so effective that the number of "disappeared
ones" in Latin America alone approaches one hundred thousand and the number
of tortured and imprisoned people in the world can be counted in their
millions. Nothing is more "natural" for capital than the fact that the
main industry of the planet is the production of the means of collective
terrorism, death and destruction, while the majority of its population
have nothing to live on. Nothing is more "natural" for official democratic
terrorism which exists everywhere than that defending its laws implies
years in prison, torture or death for those who lake attempts against its
sacred private property or its national economy by grabbing what they need,
by paralysing production or organising against the right to work, for example
by organising pickets and attacking scabs.
<p>The citizen, receptacle and producer of this social "naturalness", defender
of the laws and democracy of the national economy, is therefore prepared
to lake one more step along the inevitable path followed by modern society.
To be a citizen leads to participating in national mobilisation for the
defence of state terrorism, collaboration and informing, and capitalist
war.
<p>During the capitalist epoch, numerous ideological forms have been used
to strengthen the State's main advances towards generalised terrorism:
the defence of civilisation, the fight for socialism of democracy, against
fascism or communism, against chaos and disorder... But the best, the most
appropriate form, for the principle of the democratic state's monopoly
of violence, is direct attack on any questioning of this monopoly, any
violent opposition to slate terrorism. The pinnacle and purest form of
democracy is its total political monopoly, the state free of all ils enemies.
This is the key to the whole social democratic program (1).
<p>That's why anti-terrorism is the ideology par excellence of the terrorist
state, though nonetheless it has to be served tip mixed with other values
appropriate to all states (democracy), or particular to each, such as the
defence of the Islamic revolution, of the free world, of socialism or of
national liberation. Every anti-terrorist campaign, no matter who originates
it. serves to maintain and reinforce State terrorism and transforms its
instigators, regardless of their intention, into objective agents of state
terrorism.
<center>
<h2>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">oOo</font></h2></center>
The international crisis is forcing capital to violently impose austerity
and prepare for war. In this situation, the universal reinforcement of
state terrorism expresses itself around three main tendencies united by
an indivisible coherence;
<p><b>1.</b> A general tendency, especially among the major powers, to
terrorise their populations with a vague, monstrous enemy; "International
Terrorism". Behind this terroristic tendency hides an attempt to dragoon
and mobilise the population into local wars in which "their" state is involved.
This is concretely expressed in:
<ul>
<li>
supporting, leading or manipulating, directly or otherwise, spectacular
terrorist attacks on the population which "prove" that the war in Middle
East exists in Paris, for example.</li>

<li>
creating, at the same time. a category in itself: cruel, blind, fanatical
terrorism.</li>

<li>
magnifying repression: police presence in the streets, random checks, controls
and interrogations.</li>
</ul>
<b>2.</b> Cleverly alternating between open terror against working class
resistance, and the legitimation on the international stage, of states
who use or will use this open terror. For example in Latin America, while
some national expressions of the state systematically murder and abduct
their opponents is a day-to-day activity (Mexico, Peru, Colombia for example,
not to mention the well known cases of Guatemala or El Salvador), with
the complicity of their governments, others take advantage of a change
in political system to clear their names (Argentina, Uruguay...) and assure
immunity for torturers and murderers. In order to achieve this, they use
the whole parliamentary and judicial apparatus, including the famous rights
of man, and thereby create a precedent for the others.
<p><b>3.</b> Two things work alongside each other: the conditioning of
public opinion, and political repression: to create an amalgam of guerilla
actions against the population that they provoke themselves, and acts of
proletarian resistance, with the aim not only of isolating combative proletarians
but of gaining the active support of the population against any beginnings
or the reemergence of the proletariat as a class.
<p>This is to say that along with the state's anti-terrorist campaign,
they try:
<ul>
<li>
to terrorise the population</li>

<li>
to get the population involved in defending "its" State</li>

<li>
to create a Devil and get people ready to fight it</li>

<li>
to openly crush the proletariat with its passive acceptance and even its
collaboration (2).</li>
</ul>
"It is the cannibalism of the counter revolution itself that will develop
among the masses the conviction that there is only one way to concentrate,
shorten and simplify the death agonies of the old society and the birth
pangs of the new; revolutionary terrorism." (Marx).
<p>As we've often said, against this terrorist society, against generalised
state terrorism, the liberating violence of the proletariat is not one
option among others but a necessity. And not only in the sense that without
it, the barbarism of this society would have no limits, nor in the sense
that it is the only way of ending this endless barbarism, but also in that
it is inevitable, that the violence of the oppressor predetermines and
pushes the development of revolutionary violence (3).
<p>It is this last point that totally contrasts our viewpoint to that of
reformism.
<p>In fact the "terrorists" of Lenin's or Plekhanov's terminology (4),
expressions of the left wing of social democracy, also recognised the necessity
of a violent struggle against the state. But for these two, violent proletarian
struggle against the state was not an inevitable product of society and
the day-to-day working class struggle against capital, but something that
had to be introduced from outside. For social democracy the key problem
is consciousness, for terrorist ideology, the question of examplary action.
In both cases it is a matter of introducing from outside by means of an
act of willpower, the need for a violent political fight against the state.
For us, this is idealism, voluntarism.
<p>As far as we're concerned, proletarian terrorism, the terrorism of the
oppressed, is not the result of any external will. consciousness introduced
into the class from outside, or of any kind of conspiracy, outside agent,
instigator or manipulator. In other words, of any ideal (in the sense of
made of ideas) mediation. On the contrary, it is the inevitable material
reaction against exploitation and oppression; the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie.
Between these two analyses of social reality there is a class line. The
social democratic/terrorist explanation is unavoidably idealist and voluntarist;
ours is based on the dialectical materialist evolution of society.
<p>More than this: revolution contains neither violence nor terrorism but
their abolition; not the elimination of this or that agent of violence,
but the foundations of a society based on violence and terrorism. If the
proletariat is driven to take up the use of violence against this society
and all its agents, it is not because it is a positive expression of violence,
but rather, because it is the negative pole of this society, against which,
in the last instance, all violence is directed. As the destructive pole
of the whole of society, the active negation, it cannot help but oppose
generalised. institutional violence. Its centralisation into a violent
force toward the end of establishing its class dictatorship is nothing
but the development of this active negation, in which all the conditions
for and forms of violence are negatively determined, and as negations,
by the violence of this society (5). Therefore, nothing is more absurd
than to pretend that class violence comes from revolutionaries or that
their function is to create or import it. Revolutionaries don't "make"
violence just as they don't "build" the revolutionary party. They don't
"make" revolutions.
<p>On the contrary, their function is to act as the most determined elements
in this inevitable process which this society spontaneously engenders,
in other words to take over in practice the leadership of the Party and
the revolution.
<p>To say it again, clearly and explicitly; the communists' acts of will
do not aim to bring violence to the class, but to lead class violence towards
the movement's correct objectives. This is the only way of shortening the
interminable death agonies of this society and the birth pangs of the next.
They act precisely so that the tremendous revolutionary energy that this
society generates in the proletariat will not be squandered in thousands
of more or less separate acts of individual terrorism, without a concerted
strategy, some of which even weaken the movement. They act in this way
to organise red terrorism in a single direction towards the insurrection
and the class dictatorship, in order to prevent the continuous massacre
which results from a war without leadership.
<p>We take the opportunity here to make clear that there is no question
of making concessions to the social democratic "movementist" ideology which
leads towards classifying violence into, on the one hand. minority or individual
violence, and on the other hand, and opposed to it, collective class violence.
Individual violence is also class violence, and there is not one act in
this society that is not stained with class. The murder of a boss, a wildcat
strike, a picket that fights scabs, - all terrorist acts par excellence
- (6) can be distinguished from and opposeed to all acts of state or para-state
terrorism (reformist groups with a "terrorist" ideology).
<p>Many of these acts may not correspond to the general interests of the
movement, may be tactically inappropriate or lead to a dead end. This is
unavoidable because of the circumstances in which the proletariat is forced
to develop its violence. In most cases, the exploited is pushed around,
cornered, and oppressed beyond endurance... and the anger of liberation
generally expresses itself without tactical considerations. For this reason
revolutionaries do not carry out, support or promote any individual act.
even if they recognise them as belonging to their class. Revolutionaries
may be for or totally against the advisibility and the meaning of an action.
But thought they neither condemn an action nor applaud repression, it is
not that they are indifferent. They offer active solidarity against state
repression, and in parallel they defend the general objectives of the movement
by attempting to concentrate all these forces exploding through the holes
in the system, sometimes foolishly and irrationally, to lead them towards
their real objectives: the struggle against capital and the capitalist
state.

If violence depended on the consciousness it produces, as the social democrats
pretend, it would be very simple. Only violence produced consciously by
the "revolutionary party" would be proletarian, all actions of individuals
or isolated groups would be bourgeois or "petty bourgeois", and the correct
position would be to condemn them. This position was always the one taken
by social democracy, and it continues to lead many so-called revolutionary
groups (including the "communist left") to actively applaud the work of
slate agents. This was the position of the whole of social democracy. Stalinism
and Trotskyism when van der Lubbe burnt down the Reichstag in Germany (7).
<p>This position is from start to finish coherent with the voluntarist
vision, and in the last analysis, police vision, common to the whole bourgeoisie
and all slates, who are unable to understand the inevitable upsurges of
uncontrollable expressions of proletarian violence and therefore are always
trying to find the "agitators" behind them.
<p>The reality is much more complex, precisely because proletarian violence
in its elementary forms, prior to being organised and structured, "expresses
itself" in all manner of forms, and explodes in multiple locations. Marx
and Engels (who were never supporters of or apologists for revenge, individual
murders, planting bombs in public places, etc.) recognised in these kinds
of things class war. For example Engels, after listing a series of acts
of this kind, said:
<p>"Six attacks have been made in four months, and all have as their common
cause workers' rage against the exploiters. What is the nature of the social
relations that produce these events? I hardly need say it. These acts of
violence show that class war is declared and that the fight is taking place
openly and in public."
<p>In today's world, there are thousands of examples of this kind of desperate
elementary struggle against capital with no coordinating strategy (like
a strike which does not attempt to generalise and whose participants are
not conscious that it is a confrontation with the whole state). And although
these actions in both content and form are proletarian and clearly opposed
to those of the state or its agents, the proletariat doesn't recognise
them as such and fails to make the distinction between them and individual
terrorist actions carried out by different groups or agents of the bourgeoisie.
<p>This objective and inevitable aspect of the current period, when the
proletariat is atomised and unable to see itself as in international class
and consequently unable to constitute itself as such, greatly facilitates
the state's politics of "amalgam" and the consolidation of its terrorist
anti-terrorist campaign.
<p>However, we make clear that we do not say that terrorist actions of
individual proletarians or groups permit the strengthening of the state
like all the pseudo-working class pacifist groups do. On the contrary,
WE SAY that the generalised decay of society and the explosive development
of all its contradictions, which inevitably leads to the terrorist reinforcement
of the state, continues to progress because the proletariat does not act
as a revolutionary force (the only real limit to this tendency), and the
expression of this general confusion in the proletariat prevents it from
seeing the difference between its violence and its enemy's. and allows
the slate to utilise its amalgam technique and reinforce its anti-terrorist
campaign with the applause and collaboration of crowds of atomised proletarians
(8).
<p>In relation to this, it is not enough to talk about unavoidable material
conditions, or of factual coincidences which make anti-terrorist politics
possible and credible. It is necessary to discuss those deliberate, conscious,
state police actions which have the aim of materialising this amalgam.
Although we do not have a police vision of history, we know that the police
participate in history. We would be blind if we didn't recognise the conscious,
deliberate acts of manipulation, the direct interventions made by the state
to give credibility to its general strategy of repression, confusion and
amalgam. More than this, it is obvious that where the general interests
of the bourgeoisie are involved, and taking into account all the historical
lessons it has drawn from its experience, it acts in a more centralised,
conscious, police fashion than one might have thought. For example the
"death squads", wherever they work or have worked, are a general requirement
of the state and would have been created in any case by some faction of
capital. Nevertheless, it is important to remember that this general need
has been consciously and overtly satisfied by the central apparatus of
the state. Though we must avoid the danger of falling into a police vision
of history, we should also not succumb to the idea that the "death squads"
were organised by uncontrolled, autonomous bodies or by the famous "extreme
right". In fact, in every case, they were organised by the whole of the
State and in particular by the government, ministers, generals and top
brass.
<p>Knowing the general weakness of the proletariat in acting as a class,
an independent force, the first thing that helps the state's amalgam technique
is the formal coincidence between what the proletariat more or less confusedly
sees as its enemies, and sometimes attacks, individually or in small groups,
and the targets of nationalist groups, Stalinists, foquists. pseudo-revolutionaries
and pseudo-communists (9): some parts of the slate, factories or other
establishments, some particularly unpopular bosses. If we leave aside the
fact that in most cases these actions, far from contributing to the movement,
disorganise it (the aim of this article is not to demonstrate the disorganisation
and passivity that is produced by spectacular exemplary activism), it is
quite clear that it is these kind of actions, which try to get proletarians
to become cannon fodder for imperialist wars, permit the central organs
of the state (10) (and we repeat, seeing the general inability of the proletariat
to put forward in the view of the whole population a clearly autonomous
political line) to amalgamate any acts of proletarian resistance with the
actions of bourgeois groups. The repression which follows, based on this
amalgam, not only allows the state to present its viewpoint in general
and equally in almost every case, but also liquidates the little bits of
proletarian autonomy that were emerging: physical elimination, imprisonment...
and those who escape are isolated, and have great difficulty avoiding the
swamp of opposition nationalism (11).
<p>When we take into account the total absence of any difference between
the programmes of nationalists and their governments, we can see how easy
it is to infiltrate and manipulate them towards the most central aims of
the state, and towards the idea of oven collaboration with it (12). In
some cases, the central repressive forces can even permit them to work
in the general interests of the state against tendencies towards proletarian
autonomy (13). But sometimes all this does not satisfy the central apparatus
of the state, the bourgeois fraction that controls the government. Their
particular factional interests and their general class interests drive
them not only to finance, support and give logistic aid to this or that
terrorist group, but even to organise "terrorist" actions (14) against
another bourgeois fraction or, more likely, against the proletariat to
terrorise it into supporting its general policy of repression. It is known,
but not widely enough in our opinion, that the secret services of the major
powers - like the CIA and the KGB - systematically participate not only
in the creation of pseudo-para-police organisations, but also in direct
outrages and armed actions against the imperialist class enemy. We don't
lose any sleep over the successive attempts of the CIA to get rid of Fidel
Castro or the systematic series of accidents which dispose of people like
Torrijos or Samora Machel. That's their problem. In the same way, we don't
believe the story they tell that the first world war began because of the
Sarajevo assassination.
<p>What's important for us are the direct attacks which are launched against
our class, and what our enemies succeed in doing: mobilising our class
for interests that are not its own on the basis of an endless succession
of outrages centrally organised by the various national expressions of
the international state.
<p>Today's news is full of revelations about the direct complicity of the
state's central apparatus in terrorist actions throughout the world. It
is impossible to fully enumerate these. On top of this, we don't have,
and don't need, all the details about the complicity of the legalised criminal
conspiracies that all governments are made of. But we can give some examples.
The anti-terrorist Mitterand, and the whole socialist government, planned
the attack on Greenpeace down to the last detail. There is no doubt about
it. The anti-terrorist Reagan was not content to give logistic and financial
support to Nicaraguan guerillas, he also sponsored the perfect little saboteur's
handbook produced by hit enemies. The fact that this man organised the
bombing of Libya's two major towns is quite coherent with his defence of
anti-terrorism. Israel preceded Reagan on this terrain. The bombing of
a town is not considered a fact or war by that son of a bitch, Western
public opinion, but merely an anti-terrorist action. The bombing of some
PLO positions in Tunis (and who can say they only bombed the PLO?) was
carried out with everyone's blessing. A bomb that killed a handful of soldiers
guarding the military presence and the power of the US imperialist bloc
is terrorism - the bombing of a town in response isn't, it's anti-terrorism.
All the international channels of disinformation bombard us with this nonsense.
And of course, in the other bloc, it's the same message but the other way
round! It's so crass and absurd it seems impossible that anyone could believe
it, but they do! The media is incredibly good at its job: they say what
they're told to. In the West they say the occult figures behind terrorism
are the Libyan, Iranian and Syrian governments. But today, none can deny
that the Iranian terrorist leaders are unofficially armed by the USA, the
leaders of Western Christian anti-terrorism, on the express orders of Ronald
Reagan. But at the same time, although the heads of Syrian terrorism are
armed by the French state (there are enough economic interests involved),
the latter cannot accept the British state's view. And it doesn't Mop there.
The French government leader, who was in charge during the second leg of
the anti-terrorism campaign (the first being initialed by Mitterand at
the beginning of his term in office), wasted no effort, and used every
trick in the book of political amalgam, with the support of specific laws.
<p>For example, he began his mandate with a general policy of challenges,
detention and interrogation of proletarian militants - specifically directed
against our group - justified by a so-called "outrage" that never even
happened, but that the media treated as an established fact. He tenaciously
defended military and commercial relations with Syria and the other Middle
Eastern states, and then, after a lot of speculation about the latest wave
of exceptional criminal outrages, he announced that it had been organised
by the Israeli secret service. We do not doubt that this is possible, and
we do not doubt that behind these outrages are the French secret service
and/or their successive alliances and bust-ups with the other secret services
of the Middle Eastern states.
<p>In reality, we're not interested in who is behind each outrage. The
interwoven economic interest that determine them in the last instance are
too complex. This brief and by no means exhaustive survey only serves to
put forward the point that behind all the anti-terrorist campaigns, the
state openly pulls the strings, by stirring up or organising "terrorist"
actions to achieve the objectives we've already mentioned and to reinforce
general state terrorism, to make it quite clear that there is complete
and total coherence between this terrorism and state anti-terrorism, and
that all this is against proletarian violence, which is the only real and
final brake on the generalised terrorism of today's society.
<p>Faced with the omnipresent terrorism of the state. with the terrorism
of all existing states, the dominant reality amongst the proletariat continues
to be atomisation, passive contemplation of our enemies' inter-terrorist
spectacle, in all its morbid and macabre detail, organised by the international
channels of communication and cretinisation. Of course there are heroic
proletarian acts that give rise to here a battle, there a strike which
goes beyond all expectations and terrorises capital, there are various
violent demonstrations which attack the centres of the state (as these
lines were being written, there was a major new upsurge of proletarian
struggle in many Algerian towns) etc... But these actions have no continuity,
no common perspective, no coordinating plan. More than this, the different
sectors of the international proletariat which engage in battle one after
the other, don't yet feel that they develop one war for the same interests
and against the same enemies (15) (we are not even talking of a class conscious
of its universal project), and after a struggle, they return to the usual
state of atomisation and powerlessness against capitalist barbarism. We
have no doubt that these explosions will get bigger and become more important
in the near future. But the problem is, how this intermittent community
of actions and struggles which occasionally coincide, will transform itself
quantitatively and qualitatively into a community of action and leadership
with international perspectives, how it will coordinate and centralise
itself, bow one can ensure its continuity, how it will give birth to the
indispensible leadership, without which we will be on course for another
defeat for the movement. The task of revolutionary militants is to answer
adequately and practically to this gigantic historical challenge (16).
<h3>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">Notes</font></u></h3>
1. Marx, "Critique of the Gotha Programme".
<p>2. The so-called sanctions imposed on states which are accused of supporting
terrorism, the ludicrous measures taken in the name of human rights "against"
the South African state, the juridicial spectacle of the trial of those
guilty of "excesses" in Argentina, are of course completely coherent with
this state policy.
<p>3. One should not look at this statement in a linear fashion. We are
not supporters of the ideology that applauds state terrorism in order to
"sharpen the contradictions" (this is vulgar materialism) because it is
clear to us that counter-revolutionary terrorism can wipe out the proletariat
as a class, by means of the accumulation of class defeats, though inevitably
it will reemerge after a long period.
<p>4. We reject the terminology which defends the existence of terrorism
or terrorists in general. For us terrorism always has and always will belong
to a class: there is revolutionary and counter revolutionary terrorism.
<p>Nevertheless, there is an ideology posing as "revolutionary theory"
which apologises for certain terrorist activity. This ideology is always
linked to populism and reformism, and is still the basis of numerous pseudo-revolutionary
groups around the world (most of which are clearly bourgeois and linked
to a national state project). It was skillfully identified and criticised
by Lenin in "Revolutionary Adventurism" (Works, vol. 6). The invariant
characteristics of this voluntarist, idealist and mechanical argument are:
the ideology of the "transfer of forces" according to which each terrorist
act "sucks" energy from the state into the militants, the ideology which
justifies the "invisible", "invincible", "elusive" individual as against
the vulnerability of the "mass", the ideology of incitement and exemplary
action... in the end a vision of history which substitutes the struggle
between individuals, some of whom personify the state (the theory about
which "contraption" will be the "heart of the state"), others personifying
heroes, "revolutionaries", that is to say the struggle of organisation
against organisation, where the proletariat is reduced to a mere mass of
spectators, for the contradictions of capitalist society and the inexorable
accentuation of class struggle (See our text in Le Communiste Nos. 17 and
19: "Critique du r&eacute;formisme arm&eacute;"). In Latin America, rural
and urban foquism are obvious examples of this reformist, bourgeois ideology.
<p>5. All determinations of proletarian struggle and, in the same way,
its programme, are the practical negation of the system.
<p>6. We take this opportunity to combat the ideology that associates terrorism
with bombs and assassinations; the bourgeoisie is terrorised by all class
actions that really show the emergence of the proletariat as a force.
<p>7. The position of the real communist left was of course totally different.
See "Bilan, A propos de l'affaire van der Lubbe", in Le Communiste No.
22.
<p>8. Atomised "proletarians" who collaborate with the state. The attentive
reader will notice an incoherence with our usual terminology. We wanted
to describe a particular section of society (who have nothing to lose,
and who do have an objective interest in social revolution) and this is
why we didn't say citizen, people and population, like we usually do. We
could also use the term "anti-proletarian", the most complete expression
of which is proletarians killing each other in imperialist wars. It is
the proletariat's capitalist negation, is against its revolutionary negation:
the destruction of all social classes, and the communist self-abolition
of the proletariat.
<p>9. Like for example: the Colombian Revolutionary Armed Front or M19,
the Sandinistas in the past in Nicaragua, the Montoneros and Tupamaros
in the past in Argentina and Uruguay, ETA in Spain, the Red Brigades in
Italy, the PLO everywhere, etc...
<p>10. For us all these groups are an integrated part of the world capitalist
state. We call the heart of the state in particular the government and
the current heads of the repressive forces (which often change hands, e.g.
the Sandinistas).
<p>11. See "Exil, r&eacute;volution et contre-r&eacute;volulion" in Le
Communiste No. 25.
<p>12. For example, the endless nuances put forward by the Red Brigades:
from the open collaborators to the "real" fighters, including the repentant,
the disassociated, etc... See also the result of the arrangement between
the military, the Montoneros and the Tupamaros who came to an agreement
to right in common cause against "those who rob the nation" etc., "against
economic inequality", or for a program of national "well-being", or again,
the work of mobilisation for war carried out by the Montoneros during the
Falkland war.
<p>13. A good contribution on this theme and in particular about the Italian
example can be found in the pamphlet "Prol&eacute;taires, si vous saviez
- Le laboratoire de la contre-r&eacute;vollulion - ltalie 79/80".
<p>14. As we explained at the beginning, for us every state action is terrorist:
this is why we put sporadic and irregular terrorist action in inverted
commas. Not to do this would be a concession to what we denounced at the
beginning.
<p>15. A sentiment that existed clearly and universally at the beginning
of the century, in 1917-21, and to a lesser extent between 1967 and 73.
<p>16. See the "Propuesta Internationale" in Communism No. 4, which is
a contribution toward this aim.

<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">The word "labour" is the bourgeois word for
"human activity"</font></u></h2>
Language, like any sphere of bourgeois society, is determined by capital.
Language is fundamentally the language of the dominant class and therefore
is fundamentally bourgeois. It can be described as the supremacy of bourgeois
ideology, pervading all means of communication. Bourgeois language is a
verbal exchange developed by way of symbols that best allow the perpetuation
of class domination. So, the dominating mode of communication can, to a
large extend, impose its own limits upon us. Since it is now out of the
question to recreate a language based on a new understanding of human relations,
we are therefore perpetually compelled to unmask the treachery of words,
and to re-define them in the same way that we are compelled to re-define
concepts.
<p>The word "labour" is the perfect, total example of the falsification
of the human consciousness. Whereas man always defined, expressed, realized
himself through his vital activity (what is life if not activity?), whereas
man's realization can be achieved only through the materialization of his
vital activity (creation of objects, ideas,...), the commodity system has
confined this activity to its "labour" form. Capital has universalized
this form and, as wage labour, it dominates the planet. Hence today, while
labour has become the only way of <b>survival</b> for the vast majority,
the only way for the proletariat to exist, the "labour" form becomes man's
central vital activity, the universal activity around which everything
evolves. As labour has become man's <b>essential</b> activity, the bourgeoisie
teaches us that man's very essence is labour.
<p>That is why the word "labour" (1) -which actually designates one particular
form of human activity- now sounds like a perfect synonym for "activity",
since for most people labour has really become the totality of their activity.
Thus, "acting" means "working", while "being active" stands for "being
hard-working", that is very efficient. The cynicism and hypocrisy of the
bourgeois language is at its highest in phrases like "making money work",
which suggest an hermaphroditic wealth that begets itself as if it were
not the sweat and blood of those from whom surplus-value is extracted,
the only source of enrichment for the capitalists that "make money work".
<p>So when talking of "labour", it should be clear that using this term
determines a category, a well-defined form of production of human activity,
intrinsically linked to the commodity system; labour must be understood
as the production of human activity, as an activity <b>alien</b> to man,
to the manifestation of his life, and to the consciousness he has of his
life; it is man <b>confined</b> to his situation of worker.
<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">"Labour is the act of alienation of human
activity" (Marx - Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844)</font></u></h2>
Labour is nothing but the expression of human activity in alienation, the
expression of the manifestation of life as the <b>externalization</b> of
life (2). The alien character of labour appears in different ways, first
through the object <u>produced</u>: in fact, this does not belong to the
worker. Whereas the result of human production should appear as the greatest
manifestation of the individual, as the affirmation of man, as a mean of
recognition by others of man's own human character, labour alienates man
from his product, which confronts and stands opposed to him. The worker
is deprived of the object that he produces. Compelled to sell his labour-power,
he puts his life into the object and his life no longer belongs to him.
The externalization of labour consists in the necessity for the proletarian
to sell his labour-power in order to produce a commodity totally alien
to himself. The worker can get no satisfaction from the result of his work.
Even if the object produced had an immediate utility for him, he might
not enjoy it; he is dispossessed of its realization which is subjected
to the laws of commodity production. The absurdity of this state of things
reveals itself in all its cruelty when workers doing piece-work at 35&deg;C
(95&deg;F.) without air conditioning or ventilation are told that the factory
for which they work also manufactures air conditioners marketed with the
following slogan: "Use this air conditioner and dog-days will be over!"
<p>But the proletarian has not only become alien to the object of his activity,
he has also become alien to <b>his activity itself.</b> Labour is indeed
external to worker, and yet, since it is the only activity that provides
him his means of subsistence in the capitalist system, he is forced to
<b>submit</b>
to it. Thus labour is par excellence unfree activity, it can only be forced
and imposed.
<blockquote><i>"The alien character of labour emerges clearly in the fact
that as soon as no physical of other compulsion exists, labour is shunned
like the plague."</i>
<p>(Marx - Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844)</blockquote>
So when he works, the worker does not affirm his own essence, but rather
negates it. In the same way that he puts his life into the object and gets
deprived of it, so he surrender his existence to the activity of production
of this object.
<blockquote><i>"If then the product of labour is alienation, production
itself must be active alienation, the alienation of activity, the activity
of alienation. In the estrangement of the object of labour is merely summarized
the estrangement of labour itself."</i>
<p>(Marx - Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844)</blockquote>
Labour, the act of production in the capitalist system, thus transforms
the worker's activity into passivity, his strength into powerlessness;
eight hours a day of absurd activity directed against human essence and
senses; self-alienation as the above-mentioned alienation of the object.
<p>Loss of himself, loss of the object, and now <b>loss of fellow men</b>.
Alienated labour makes man alien to the species (3). It alienates individual
life from the species-life. The difference between man and animal lies
in the fact that the latter identifies directly with its vital activity,
<i>"it
is this activity". But man makes his vital activity itself an object of
his will and consciousness. He has a conscious vital activity."</i> (Marx
- Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts oof 1844). As man's vital activity
becomes alienated labour in the commodity system, the relation is reversed:
the worker is now forced to make of his conscious vital activity -a mere
means of subsistence- a <b>means</b> of existence!! Whereas the conscious
vital activity should be man's expression of the realization of an objective
world in which he sees his own reflection -this production being his active
species-life, and a relationship between humans- alienated labour turns
man's life activity into a mere production of riches.
<blockquote><i>"The consciousness which man has of his species is thus
transformed by estrangement in such a way that species (life) becomes for
him a means."</i>
<p>(Marx - Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844)</blockquote>
Labour alienates man from himself, from his species-being and so from the
other man confronting him.
<blockquote><i>"What applies to a man's relation to his work, to the product
of his labour and to himself, also holds of a man's relation to the other
man, and to the other man's labour and object of labour. In fact, the proposition
that man's species-nature is estranged from him means that one man is estranged
from the other, as each of them is from man's essential nature."</i>
<p>(Marx - Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844)</blockquote>
This consciousness of human species of fellow man is shattered by capital.
The expressions of class solidarity&nbsp; help draw the sketch of man's
species consciousness: the man understanding that his own interests fit
in with those of the community, the human being seeking to satisfy his
needs and desires through the enjoyment of the collective being.
<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">The abolition of labour expresses itself
through the political form of the emancipation of the proletariat</font></u></h2>
We have just seen that man is alienated by labour, that he no longer belongs
to himself, he must therefore belong to someone else. If the activity is
a torment for the worker, it must be a source of enjoyment to another.
Through alienated labour, man not only produces a relation alien to his
object and to his production; he also creates the domination of the non-producer
over his object, over his productive activity and over himself.
<p>There is no reason at all why activity should be confined, alienated,
externalized in the "labour" form, -no reason but one: the interest of
the dominant class. The profit that the bourgeoisie gets from its domination
keeps it from seeing further than its own egoistic interests. The social
class that will set humanity free from alienated labour can only be the
one that suffers the most from it. The universal emancipation of man depends
on the emancipation of the proletariat, for in its relation to production,
this class encompasses the whole boundage of humanity.
<blockquote><i>"A class with radical chains, a class in civil society that
is not of the civil society, a class that is the dissolution of all classes,
a sphere of society having a universal character because of its universal
suffering and claiming no particular right because no particular wrong
but unqualified wrong is perpetrated on it; a sphere that can claim no
traditional title but only a human title; a sphere that does not stand
partially opposed to the consequences, but totally opposed to the premises
of the German political system; a sphere, finally, that cannot emancipate
itself without emancipating itself from all the other spheres of society,
thereby emancipating them; a sphere, in short, that is the complete loss
of humanity and can only redeem itself through the total redemption of
humanity. This dissolution of society existing as a particular class is
the proletariat."</i>
<p>(Marx - Critique of Hegel's philosophy of right)</blockquote>
This historical task of freeing humanity from labour, of resolving, once
and for all, all antagonisms between man and nature, among men, between
man's activity and his enjoyment, between the individual and the species
therefore rests with the proletariat organized as a class, hence as a party.

<i><u><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+3>Down with labour !!!</font></font></u></i></h2>
Now it can be more easier to realize why the unions' and the lefties' watch-words
about "the right to work" and "job-security" are highly reactionary and
utopian. The proletarians know that in the capital system working is the
only way to provide for their needs, and that, in this sense, unemployment
clearly means... death. Evidence of this is the thousands of human beings
dying from starvation every day. The worker's demand for a job must therefore
be understood as the demand for the possibility for him and his family
to eat, to dress and to reproduce. Yet demanding work for all within the
bourgeois system amounts to pretending that this is possible, thus denying
the catastrophic nature of capitalism, its lack of control of the movement
it begets. The communists know that demanding&nbsp; work for all is utopian,
and they use the fact that capital has never been able to achieve full
employment, even in its most prosperous periods, as evidence for this.
The watch-word "the right to work" is reactionary, for it corresponds to
an idealistic view of the ruling system; it denies the contradictory nature
of capital which creates work only to create unemployment, that is, zero
work; the nature of capitalist dictatorship is wealth begetting poverty.
All "economists" and ideologists of labour try to tell us that working
is necessary, because they mistake commodity production for social riches.
Nothing is more hypocritical than trying to present labour as the only
source of wealth. We define labour, as alienated, externalized activity,
as the loss of humanity.
<blockquote><i>"Labour itself, not only in present conditions but universally
insofar as its purpose is merely the increase of wealth, is harmful and
deleterious."</i>
<p>(Marx - Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844)</blockquote>
Instead of the reactionary watch-word <i>"an equal pay for an equal working-day"</i>,
Marx was already impelling us to inscribe the revolutionary watch-word:
<i>"Abolition
of wage labour".</i> In the same way, instead of claims <i>"work for all"</i>,
we put forward the invariant watch-word from the communist program: <b><i>"Down
with labour!!"</i></b>
<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">Labour, leisure and communism</font></u></h2>

<blockquote><i>"In all revolutions up till now, the mode of activity always
remained unscathed and it was only a question of a different distribution
of this activity, a new distribution of labour to other persons, whilst
the communist revolution is directed against the preceding mode of activity,
does away with labour and abolishes the rule of all classes with the classes
themselves."</i>
<p>(Marx - The German Ideology)</blockquote>
Communism destroys the mode of activity specific to the capitalist system:
labour, the essence of private property. And while it abolishes labour,
it abolishes the organization of leisure as an indispensable complement
of alienated labour. By leisure, we mean the time given to the proletarian
for the reproduction of his labour-power. Just as wages represent the maintenance
of the worker and must be considered only as the necessary "greasing" for
the pistons to function, so leisure has only one utility, as an outlet
for the tensions accumulated during the labour-activity. Leisure has nothing
to do with free time, since for the worker the point is to prepare his
forces to be more efficient to allow ever more intensifying exploitation.
Leisure corresponds to the necessity for the worker to be in fine fettle
on Monday mornings. Because of his work, man no longer knows the true sense
of his vital activity and during his "lost" hours he will only reproduce
an activity "mirroring" alienated labour, so that this part of his time,
of his so-called "free" activity, does not contradict the "working" part.
Externalized inactivity can only correspond to externalized activity; externalized
leisure to externalized labour. Capital matches working time against leisure
time, it separates the two activities but also renders them complementary.
Schooltime already prepares for this separation: "You should work hard
and play hard, but never do both at the same time!" But human activity
is a totality. In this sense, the communist society has nothing to do with
any sort of leisure society, the idealization of the "positive" pole of
bourgeois society. To the separation labour/leisure, communism opposes
vital activity as enjoyment, enjoyment as activity.
<blockquote><i>"Activity and enjoyment are social in their content as well
as in their origin; they are social activity and social enjoyment."</i>
<p>(Marx - Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844)</blockquote>
In primitive communism, the same term was used for "work" and "play". In
the same way, communism abolishes oppositions between working time and
leisure time, between production and apprenticeship, between living and
experiencing. This description does not come from any idyllic anticipation,
from any idealistic vision of the future, but it does result from the very
movement of history and of the world. This movement is in no way subjectal
to chance; it is the fantastic development of the productive forces that
makes communism a possibility, a necessity for today.
<p>The abolition of labour as externalized human activity is an essential
part of the communist programme and the proletariat will accomplish this
human task through its affirmation as the dominant class so as to negate
all classes. It is against the 40 hours working week, the torturing alarmclock,
the distressing search for a job, the redundancies, the time spend packed
like sardines in the underground, the hellish pace of work, private property,
the exploitation of man by man,... that we will use our strength, our knowledge
and our determination for the building of a labour-free society, a communist
society affording the community the free disposal of its time for the realization
of <b>Human activity.</b>
<blockquote><i>"Another source of demoralization among the workers is their
being condemned to work. As voluntary, productive activity is the highest
enjoyment known to us, as is compulsory toil the most cruel, degrading
punishment. Nothing is more terrible than being constrained to do some
one thing every day from morning until night against one's will. And the
more a man the worker feels himself, the more hateful must his work be
to him, because he feels the constrain, the aimlessness of it for himself."</i>
<p>(Engels - The condition of the working-class in England - 1854)</blockquote>

1. The word "labour" is latin origin, it comes from "tripalium" which means
"instrument of torture".
<p>2. For the definition of "externalization", see the article: "From man's
alienation to human community".
<p>3. The species should be understood as man understanding himself as
man, the consciousness that the human individual has of the human species.
