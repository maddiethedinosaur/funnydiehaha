<font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+4>About the bombings of March 11th,
2004 in Madrid</font></font></h1></center>

<hr SIZE=10 NOSHADE WIDTH="100%">
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">The war that the coalition leads in Iraq
under the leadership of the United States also takes place here, in Europe,
in Australia, in the United States, in Mexico, in Indonesia... The bombings
in Madrid confirmed this reality: Madrid is Baghdad, as tomorrow any European
or American metropolis can become Basra or Falludja. In this world there
is no innocent and, objectively, the inhabitants of countries whose States
are slaughtering everywhere on this planet are not considered as such.
The imposing massacre of proletarians in Madrid has been necessary so that
some proletarians of that country assume this brutal reality and take to
the streets in order to fight against their oppressors, against those who
send them to war and force them to take part into it in the rear (through
work, vote, taxes...), while screaming this terrifying truth: <i>“Your
wars, our deaths!”</i></font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">It is only when the terrorism that “our”
bourgeois and “our” States are imposing everywhere stroke in an undifferentiated
way our brothers of Madrid, that some factions of the proletariat in Spain
and in other countries in Europe have recover their class terrain struggling
against those who send us/them dying and killing for the defense of the
bourgeois interests all over the world.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">It is not about changing this government
for another one, nor to oppose bourgeois peace to war; peace is only one
moment of war. Besides we know what the promises of the “socialists” of
Spain mean (is it necessary to recall the promise of rupture with NATO
that never took place and that constituted the center of the campaign of
these same socialists, some years ago?). If they withdrew the troops from
Iraq, it is because we, proletarians, frightened them, otherwise they could
not have governed. The Spanish State still remains an important member
of the international repression led by the White House: it sends anti-riot
material, vehicles and troops in Latin America and it demonstrates the
repressive capacities of its cops in former Yugoslavia, in Afghanistan...
If we don't fight against them today, tomorrow they will return to Iraq
with more cops, with a larger humanitarian cover and under the flag of
the UN, badly covering up that they legitimate the same war, the same repression.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">The determined proletarian groups that took
to the streets to denounce the fact that the slaughters perpetrated by
“our” bourgeois, by “our” States and imperialistic blocks are responsible
for the death of the people killed here; also tell us that the war in Iraq
is also here, that in their everyday life proletarians practically choose
between supporting their bourgeois national economy and therefore take
part in the massacres of our class brothers all over the world, or, on
the contrary, taking to the streets in order to struggle against their
own bourgeois, to impose the revolutionary violence in order to stop the
murderous wars that “our own” States are making everywhere in the world.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Let’s not wait for more proletarian massacres
in Iraq and in “our cities” to fight “here and now” against war. Capitalism
permanently develops this terrorism against humanity. The whole functioning
of “our national economies”, of “our democratic systems” uses the proletarian
blood to perpetuate itself.</font>
