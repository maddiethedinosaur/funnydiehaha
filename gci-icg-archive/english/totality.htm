Capital has constituted the world as totality. Abstracted from all regional
particularities, it has submitted the totality of the human beings to its
universal dictatorship, transforming them into simple means of its valorization.
But it has not eliminated the contradictions, in the contrary, it has simplified
and sharpened it.
<p>It has not abolished the contradictions proper to the dominant classes
of the past, no more than the defects specific to all class societies (for
instance: racism, oppression,...). Here also, Capital has carried out these
contradictions to their maximal expression and multiplied to infinity all
the atrocities of the exploitation societies of the past.
<p>In its substance itself, Capital contains the totality and the dispersion,
the force until the generalized centralization (centripetal force) and
the centrifugal force, unity and separation, the frantic tendency to the
building and to the development of the productive forces, in the same time
that their total depreciation and destruction... and finally, the permanent
need of alliances and unions and the imperialist war of destruction. It
means at each time of expressions adopted by the essential contradiction
which characterized it: the contradiction between valorization/devalorization.
That means that the essential element of Capital, its life, is the permanent
valorization of the value, what it can't achieve without permanently revolutionize
the mode of production and spark off convulsions, still permanently, of
devalorization (1).
<p>Social-democracy, in its right as well as its left versions, has never
understood the inherent contradiction of Capital. Its theories were only
vulgarizations of marxism or, better said, consisted to translate into
a "marxist" language the theories of the vulgar economists of that period.
Not to understand the contradiction, is not to understand the movement,
which means life, the being. So, Capital was assimilated to one of its
particular aspects, and in general to its positive aspect (which is the
proper of all vulgar economy, apologizing everything). So, all the theories
of the decadency of the financial capital, of ultra-imperialism,... start
with the positive pole of capitalism and with the believe that Capital
was at a certain moment progressive in itself, that it developed the productive
forces without hindering it and destroying it in the same time (2) and
that it contained as unique tendency, the universal centralization. In
fact, social-democrats have never understood Capital as a <u>being</u>,
as a phenomenon in motion and in constant revolution, as a value in process.
They were then absolutely unable to understand that the whole world was
a world of production and of reproduction of Capital which did not exclude,
but in the contrary conditioned and determined, the permanence and the
development of properly capitalist wars.
<p>As far as they have never understood that within <u>the essence of Capital</u>
was contained its universality and in the same time, the war of destruction
of the other capitals (and they have less understood that that war is a
war of destruction of the historical subject of communism: proletariat),
the social-democrats had to find a new element to explain the permanent
intensification of the world capitalist wars at the end of the past century.
Then, new theories have surged defining imperialism as a historical novelty
containing a gathering of new characteristics, as period, as phase,...;
these theories implied a revision and an absolute falsification of history.
As if capitalism could not, well before, have been imperialist (3).
<p>Capital was always imperialist! Moreover: from pre-capitalist societies
of pre- and post-christian classes exploitation, Capital has inherited
the need of war between the dominant classes for the sharing, of the world.
But under the capitalist dictatorship, these wars of affirmation and of
development of the mode of production, these wars of plundering and of
sharing of the means of production, which in the other modes of production
developed itself occasionally and depending of considerable and extremely
complex factors, became totally systematic and necessary: <u>capitalism
can't live without war; the real subject of imperialist war, it's Capital.</u>
<p>From the believe that imperialism was a kind of politic of capitalism
which corresponded to a period or to a determined phase and to a kind of
action which corresponded to the "capitalism of the imperialist countries"
(!), the social-democracy achieved to conclude that the wars under capitalism
could or could not be imperialist (4) or, differently said, that in the
middle of the 19th and 20th centuries, the wars between States could not
be imperialist. Indeed (but the development of that issue would lead us
to pass the limits fixed by this text), the bourgeois and counterrevolutionary
practice of the social-democratic parties avoided them to understand Capital.
Reciprocally and more essentially, these new so-called "anti-imperialist"
theories permitted to justify the imperialist politic of the international
social-democracy (5).
<p>As we have showed it many times, the imperialistic character of Capital
has to be find in each <u>atom of value in reproduction</u>. Each particle
of Capital searches the biggest valorization possible (it means the maximization
of the rate of profit) and is ready to sacrifice everything to obtain it
(including its own bourgeois manager, as Marx will show it). In that process,
it enters in the general circulation (Capital seen in its totality), it
means that it enters in the general field of competition and war to obtain
that valorization. The biggest mass of capital is put in the best conditions
to obtain a bigger rate of profit and, to do that, the concentration and
the centralization are developed in symbiosis (6).
<p>All capital is a mass of particles of capital united for the war of
valorization, which tend to stick to other particles on its way. All institution
for the imperialistic war (army, state, constellation of states,...) is,
at that consideration, the exclusive executioner, <u>in its war</u>, of
the politic of Capital (and consequently of a unity of the capital). It's
therefore absurd to separate the State of the capital and the imperialism
of the latter, and to pretend that during the capitalist period non-imperialist
States exist and/or non-imperialist wars. Capital has reduced all the realities
to its own reality. It has submitted all the previous subjects (human beings,
groupings, states, alliances of states,...) to itself as a totalitary reality
and has transformed them into simple means of its valorization, into simple
instruments for itself. Capital has in the same time transformed itself
into an <u>exclusive subject</u>, into a subject by excellence.
<p>The reason why Capital as total and world Capital expresses itself,
in the same time, as particularized capital, as capital split up in different
particular capitals which fight each others; the reason why it will never
exist under the shape of only one consortium, of one and unique monopoly
or of a worldwide ultra-imperialism which would have abolished the whole
of its contradictions, all of that deduced from the essence of Capital
itself and in any other manner from the particular characteristics of countries
or States. In each atom of value in process, lays not only the essential
necessity to ally and to centralise, but also to be able to carry out that
unification only <u>against</u> the other capitals in valorization (7).
It's necessary to explain here the opposition with communism. While the
unification of the proletariat is an objective in itself and that it does
exist a total coincidence between the objective of communism (the world
human community) and that process of association, of unification, for the
capital in the contrary, the unification is a simple antithesis (a purely
negative negation), a simple mean to be more powerful in the <u>trade war</u>
and the
<u>military war</u>.
<p>The capital wants to become more powerful in the trade war, not only
for a superficial problem of markets (which is in general the only one
understood by the vulgar economists, including the social-democrats), but
also because the valorizing value attracts the value to be more profitable
in the buying of the means of production: a scale economy, and/or the so-called
"external economies",... Said differently, the more the capital which transforms
itself into productive capital is important, the more it's easy to obtain
and to pass the average rate of profit.
<p>Regarding the military war, it's only the following of the trade war
at a superior level, for the same general reasons and because the open
war is won, in the same time, in the development of the productive forces
and in its following in the military economy.
<p>In all cases, from the joint-stock companies, to the banks, states or
constellations of states, the main characteristic of all union, is the
alliance of miscellaneous interests where the opposition is inherent to
the submission of all to the <u>market</u>, where all the agreements presuppose
the autonomy and the selfishness of each of the contractibles.
<p>The optimal functioning of these unions is not precisely defined by
the identity of the interests, but in the opposite, by the recognition
of the conflicting interests of all the parties and by the partial and
occasional renunciations of each of the contractibles on behalf of the
only common interest (8): the one to be in the best conditions to reproduce
the capital, that means to win the war. The opposition with the kind of
unity of communism, becomes more obvious, because in communism there is
no renunciation, no particular sacrifice on behalf of a supposed common
good, but in the contrary, the direct affirmation of the interest of the
human being and the species, without any mediation or subordination.
<p>That's why, even when communism expresses itself locally, as a territorial
action, carried out forward by a fistful of men in any point of the world,
it contains the totality, and in any of these particular expressions, it
develops the interests of the world human community (9). That's why it
does not need any democracy which comes to organize and hide the oppositions
(by repressing if necessary); it does not care of a democracy which comes
to conciliate the interests, and unify and organize what is socially antagonistic.
<p>In the contrary, the unity of the capital (10) is always a unity of
capitals versus other capitals. The development of the capital can't be
anything else than the development of war -against communism of course,
but also- against the other capitals. Achieved at that point, the valorization
of the capital can't be realize anymore but by destroying its rivals, or
by centralizing and revolutionizing its productive forces, which is exactly
the same. Indeed, all development of the productive forces in an enterprise,
in a grouping of enterprises, of countries... (which works, without any
exceptions, to improve the conditions of valorization, could it please
the capitalist or not, the president of the republic or the trade-unionist
on duty), <u>attacks</u> the conditions of valorization of the capitals
of the whole world, then devalorizing the means of production.
<p>At the present circumstances, and that so many imbeciles in freedom
proclaim that such State is more imperialistic than another, that such
president is an imperialistic agent and in the opposite such other is not,
that the problem lays between imperialistic countries and "under-developed"
countries (!) or which is the same, we should find a cordial harmony and
peace between the countries, or moreover that if in the world we could
achieve to the perfect and well balanced development (!) of capitalism,
wars could have been avoided...; then in the present circumstances, and
that all these idiocies (and many other complementary stupidities!) are
in the air, we have considered as fundamental, regarding this issue, to
put some dots on the "i". It seemed important to us, above all regarding
the particular aspects of the imperialistic contradictions, not to let
it be understood in the vulgar and journalistic sense given by the bourgeois
, but -in all circumstances- as inherent expressions to the reality of
the world capitalistic society. It's obvious that that way of understanding
the things lets only one alternative: the continuation of the imperialistic
barbary or the destruction from the top to the bottom and vice versa of
the whole society based upon Capital.

<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">Notes</font></u></h3>
1. Let's remind that all revolution of the productive forces in a given
sector -revolution always introduced to increase the rate of profit (extraordinary
surplus value)-, decreases immediately and directly the unitary values
produced in that sector, as well as the means of production, but devalorizes
also (although not by an immediate manner) the unitary values of goods
from all sectors, including more specifically the means of production of
the whole world, which constitute the physical matter of the fix capital
(buildings, infrastructures, manufacturing plants...).
<p>2. Which constitutes in itself, a full revision of the basises of Marx's
arguments.
<p>3. Cf. "Le pire produit de l'imp&eacute;rialisme: l'anti-imp&eacute;rialisme"
in Le Communiste No.25
<p>4. And it's historically very clear that the social-democrats didn't
made any reference to the revolutionary war of the proletariat against
Capital, but well to the wars between nations.
<p>5. The social-democracy in South America, in agreement with the bourgeois
classification between countries, corresponded to the social-democracy
of the "non-imperialist countries"; it denied the vulgar materialist theory
of the worker aristocracy, but was obviously not less imperialist than
the others (which would have no sense!). It clearly constituted, as in
any other part of the world, a decisive force against the revolution and
at the service of the recruitment of the workers for the capitalist war.
<p>6. That symbiosis has contributed to the false assimilation between
each of these concepts. The distinction done by Marx in the "Capital" between
the concentration -"based directly on the accumulation or moreover, identical
with it"- and the centralization, that means "the concentration of already
existing capitals", keeps all its pertinency because "though the relative
expansion and intensity of the movement of centralization depends also,
to a certain point, of the level already reached by the capitalist wealth
and the superiority of the economical mechanism, the progresses of the
centralization do not depend of a positive increase of the social capital."
<p>7. Except of course the explicit unification of the whole capital against
communism, against proletarian subversion. And we say <u>explicit</u> unification,
because the capitalist war, the war between imperialist forces is de facto
an <u>implicit</u> unification (under cover of the separation and war)
against the proletariat and its historical objective: communism.
<p>8. One has not to forget that the very basis of the capitalist society
presupposes the historical production of the individual, of the citizen,
that means the war of everybody versus everybody, ruled by the right which
recognizes the generalized antagonism of the individuals as basis and ground
of their existence. The "unitary society", the nation, the people... is
the common existence of these individuals confronting each other throughout
their mutual recognition as owners of goods. The democracy is precisely
that permanent reproduction of atomized and selfish individuals confronted
with each other, in the same time that their generalized conciliation.
The generalization of the conciliation is itself the product of the universality
of the alienation of the personal activity (wage labour) and is imposed
by the violence and the terrorism of the state.
<p>9. Marx underlines that: "... even though it could have happened in
only one industrial district, a social revolution stands at the point of
view of the totality, because it's a protestation of the human against
dehumanized life, because it starts from the point of view of each real
individual, because the collective being (gemeinwesen) where the individual
tries not to be isolated anymore is the real collective being of the human,
the human being." (Gloses marginales critiques &agrave; l'article: "Le
roi de Prusse et la r&eacute;forme sociale par un Prussien" - Karl Marx)
