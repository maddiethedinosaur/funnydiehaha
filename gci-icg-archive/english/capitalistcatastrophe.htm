The “Short walk under the black sun of capital” we published in our review
in French <i>Communism</i>e n&deg;59 (October 2007) –and we will afterwards
refer to as the editorial of this review- gave rise to reactions and discussions.
The main criticized problem is, with good reason, its lack of distance
as regards Mike Davis’ book “<i>Planet of Slums</i>” (Verso, 2006) from
which we took many facts and information and replicated long excerpts.
While doing this, obviously some aspects of the author’s ideology got in
and were introduced in our editorial, ideology we don’t share and towards
which we didn’t clarify our divergences. We can mention, for example, with
regard to Brazil or Argentina, the fact to attribute the working-class
districts cleansing exclusively to the “military junta” whereas actually
this policies has been led, with an exemplary continuity, by all successive
governments since decades. In a more general way, we are obliged to recognize
that while essentially taking Mike Davis’s book as a basis, the editorial
was plenty focused on the most extreme cases of <i>absolute </i>poverty,
marginalizing therefore the importance of the
<i>relative</i> deterioration
of the proletariat’s survival conditions, i.e. the attacks against these
conditions and their consequences, whatever is their initial level. So
although the editorial emphasized the similarities between various situations
lived by masses of proletarians, it didn’t insist enough on the unavoidable
exacerbation of the generalized relative misery as a general limit of the
bourgeois society.
<p>In any case, the editorial would at least have to be more critical about
the limits of the main source used, to keep its distance from it or even
to develop the antagonism between certain positions of the author and our
own framework, as we already did by the way about this same author –Mike
Davis- when we extensively referred to his book “<i>City of Quartz</i>”
to write our text on jails in the USA, published in French in <i>Communisme</i>
n&deg;50 (June 2000). Here is this critics:
<p>“<i>Most of the information we give here about Los Angeles are taken
from ‘City of Quartz: Excavating the Future in Los Angeles’ by Mike Davis,
Knopf Publishing Group (1992), chapter 4, ‘Fortress L.A.’. The author gives
a lot of information that allows defining the reality of social classes
and capitalism in the United States, but he falls back into the dullest
reformism as soon as it is about leading a concrete action (what also shows
the limits of the understanding that frames the description of this social
reality). Among other things, Mike Davis leads a campaign for a private
bill recommending the organization of an urban peacekeeping force –i.e.
cops- intended to help and to supervise a process of truce between the
gangs in Los Angeles! Which just goes to prove once again that the maximum
of originality reformism is able to show results inevitably in the claiming
of new police forces.</i>”
<p>Beyond the problems that we have just clarified, it is also obvious
that the relation between the deterioration of proletarians’ survival conditions
and what we are firstly interested in –i.e. the revolution- is nowhere
really clarified in our previous editorial. The proletariat as a subject
of the revolution emerges there only through the final quotation of Pannekoek.
Although it expresses the fundamentals of our program, the connection between
the deepening of the crises, the development of the proletariat’s struggles
and the meltdown of capitalism is supposed there in a too general way,
valid in every era, and cannot give an account of how the present situation
of capitalism is rather exceptional. Let’s use again the conclusions preceding
this quotation in our last review:
<p>“<i>All along this walk under the black sun of capital, we tried to
broach the capitalist catastrophe from the point of view of the proletariat’s
day-to-day life all over the planet while providing a series of concrete
examples. It seems to us important to put a reality on words and not content
ourselves with merely expressing what exists. This catastrophe is so deep
today that it immediately became palpable, visible and condenses in all
the aspects of proletarians’ life; firstly in work: never it has been so
hard, destructive and so few remunerative. Food then, always more damaged
and contaminated to such a level that it kills as much, if not more, than
it feeds. Housing conditions also probably reached unknown bloody awful
levels until now; we described them for a long time. Even diseases, always
more virulent and massive, destroying and crushing thousands of lives.
Wars also, always more generalized and destructive. The biotope finally,
which is used as environment for our species, always more damaged, always
more dangerous, always more poisoned… announcing for decades to come the
very possibility of its disappearance provoking the end of everything that
lives to the surface of the globe. In short, capitalism, in a visible and
palpable way, appears for an increasing mass of proletarians all over the
world for what it is: a real apocalypse, a hell. One could endlessly lengthen
this description to reach the same conclusions: capital ended up exacerbating
to an extraordinary level most of its own contradictions and especially
the most essential, i.e. the production of a plethoric social class it
doesn’t know what to do about in the face of the present necessities of
its own valorisation-devalorisation. Today, there are too much of capitals
that don’t manage anymore to valorise themselves, devalorisation is hitting
everywhere including among variable capital, i.e. proletarians. And as
Marx emphasized in the Manifesto of the Communist Party: ‘And how does
the bourgeoisie get over these crises? On the one hand, by enforced destruction
of a mass of productive forces; on the other, by the conquest of new markets,
and by the more thorough exploitation of the old ones. That is to say,
by paving the way for more extensive and more destructive crises, and by
diminishing the means whereby crises are prevented.’</i>
<p><i>Generalized pauperisation, conditions of exploitation always harder,
epidemics, generalized poisoning of air, water and food, famines, and generalization
of war… by these means the massive destruction of the proletariat currently
occurs. This excess labour force, this proletariat extra, the bourgeoisie
still manages –for the moment- to control it, to discipline it, to teach
it its place, to make it working, to unionise it, to make it accepting
its fate, etc., to make it dying in camps, in wars… but as we can notice
it day after day, the process of valorisation-devalorisation races out
of control and calls for new wars, always bigger, always more powerful.
The capitalist ogre shouts out to his managers’ ears that it is thirsty,
it needs always more blood, its appetite of cadavers is always more excessive.
The death of excess proletarians and the massive destruction of capitals
incapable to valorise are to the agenda of the capitalist diary to give
a boost to a new cycle of growth. For capital the local wars are not enough
anymore, it is necessary to GENERALIZE them! The same goes for the very
survival of capital.</i>”
<p>As it is understandable, the conclusion insisted on the ineluctable
deepening of the contradiction between human needs and capital’s needs
–and war is the highest moment of these needs- but didn’t broach the question
to know how the development of this contradiction materializes on the ground
of the open confrontation between the classes.
<p>It’s not that this question appeared as unknown to us: we discuss about
since always, not without any polemic by the way, but without succeeding
to publish a specific material. Therefore the quotation of Pannekoek doesn’t
appear as the result of all the development, but as a purely theoretical
view or the expression of a desire. Indeed, in the absence of a relevant
explanation, the affirmation according to which “<i>the emancipation of
the proletariat by itself is the meltdown of capitalism</i>” appears like
an abstract formula and a controversial issue. The reader could thus draw
the conclusion of a mechanicist conception of the revolutionary process,
according to which “the entry in phase of decomposition of capital would
drive the appearance of the class <i>for itself</i>, of a real pure ‘revolutionary
proletariat’, stripped of the contradictions that undermined the class
<i>as
itself</i>”. (1) This kind of schematic vision was certainly not carried
out by our editorial but we must admit that in the absence of any clarification
about the issue of the capitalism meltdown, about the relation between
objective conditions and action subjective of the proletariat, the doubt
still existed.
<h3>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">BREAKDOWN OF PROLETARIAT’S STRUCTURES AND
IDEOLOGY</font></u></h3>
Actually this famous discussion about the relation between the capital’s
catastrophe and its positive destruction by the proletariat runs across
the whole history of our movement, the whole history of the revolutionary
proletariat, the whole history of the party. We touched it through several
points of view since our group exists. And it is obvious that the way we
shortened this discussion in the previous editorial, between the observation
of the catastrophe and the revolution, reflects the very weakness of our
movement and its vanguard expressions, which record the depth of the catastrophe
at all levels of life under capital as well as the pathetic level of proletarian
associationism, of structuring of the revolutionary centralization at the
international level. Far from becoming less marked, the contradiction is
continually increasing between the total inability of the capitalist mode
of production to satisfy the necessities of the big masses of human beings
and the organization in force of the world proletariat to destroy this
society. Any revolutionary expression meets today this real difficulty
to express the relation between catastrophe and revolution, between worsening
of living conditions and revolutionary destruction of the present society.
<p>At the comprehensive level, this can be obviously explained by a whole
series of capital’s ideological triumphs that discourage any proletarian
association and struggles led on their own perspectives. Here we can mention
some strong lines:
<ul>
<li>
The collapse of the Marxist-Leninist model of capitalism is not grasped
by the large masses as the death of Stalinism and all the forces that supported
the Leninist counterrevolution but on the contrary as the end of the very
possibilities of Communist revolution. A deep discouragement and the acceptance
of capitalism as only possible world were thus overcoming generations of
combative proletarians.</li>

<li>
The obvious lack of human perspective offered by the bourgeois society
is therefore not transformed into a revolutionary force claiming Communism
as only perspective, because Communism itself became quite unknown, or
even identified with a monstrous concentration camp society, which far
from abolishing the evils of the bourgeois society on the contrary bring
them to a climax.</li>

<li>
The propaganda in favour of the world of money as the only possible thus
loses its far right ridiculous and sectarian character to become the tacit
daily bread of any political speech, the horizon of any pub chatting. Even
more, for the first time in the history of the bourgeois society it becomes
not only believable but also indisputable that any “reasonable” proposition
can only be a reformist one.</li>

<li>
The entire political spectrum conforms to the line of this omnipresent
reformism; “<i>yes, another world is possible</i>” but it is always the
same one, specially groomed under such or such new management, such or
such reform and other “Tobin Tax”.</li>

<li>
Freedom to choose, citizen life, democracy, popular participation… everything
that comforts and consolidates the individual and the false communities
not only becomes the sole allowed attitude but establish itself also as
a democratic totalitarianism, excluding and repressing any proletarian
class expression.</li>

<li>
Even the proletarian associationism is isolated and condemned as a sect
by this omnipresent democratic totalitarianism. Instead of claiming organization,
association or even solidarity between proletarians just a little bit,
one proclaims to be “free”, one feels “leading an unfettered existence
and living without bondage”, repeating thus the fundamental views of his
own proslavery, the crucial ideology of commodity and the state.</li>
</ul>
But the general difficulty to express the present contradictory relation
between catastrophe and revolution is also explained by the own mechanisms
of the capital’s reproduction, <i>pre-ideological</i> mechanisms, as it
were, or, otherwise said, constituting the raw material of ideologies.
<ul>
<li>
We think in general about market mechanisms as reproducing the atomised
individual, i.e. the production and reproduction of the individual as isolated
seller of his labour force, the world generalization of the antagonistic
interests between sellers and buyers, the production and reproduction of
democratic mechanisms too.</li>

<li>
Not only are these mechanisms at the root of isolation and mythology about
the freedom to choose, but they are also at the root of the <i>social naturalization</i>
of the individual, as if he had always existed and has to exist forever.
This naturalization of the individual consolidates the belief in all the
other ideological naturalizations of the bourgeois society (money, state,
private property… considered as a-historic realities) and allows to exclude,
as a <i>natural opposition</i>, any demonstration of the historic tendency
of the proletariat to constitute itself as a revolutionary party, which
“quite naturally” will be categorized as sectarian, terrorist, authoritative,
dogmatic…</li>
</ul>
The motto “every man for himself” is produced from the evolution of the
commodity society as well as it produces in turn goods which strengthen
the generalized isolation. Thus, if television (and its complements like
video, games console…) was a decisive step against any proletarians’ associative
life, the obstinate and always increasing tendency to subordinate life
to the image and the spectacle continues to deepen. The generalized present
tendency to substitute real (still a few) relations for virtual relations
represents another remarkable quality leap in the production of the bourgeois
individual, in competition with each other.
<p>Not only had capitalism separated human beings while making from them
individuals mediatized by property and commodity, not only had been any
relation between humans subordinated to representations, mediatized by
image, dissolved in the spectacle of a world ridded of its fundamental
contradiction; but it becomes now indispensable for being admitted to the
kingdom of “real” relations between isolated individuals, to be the happy
owner of technological portable artefacts (telephony, computers, audio…)
–which are ephemeral and replaceable- that at any time and instantaneously
connect <i>the separated as a separated</i> (… and the overactive/free
employee for his exploiters as well); artefacts which confer an “active
rank” in the world on the multitude of mad and anxious egos, according
to the mass-produced range of “his own choices”, and which are finally
supposed to make us living these relations as if they were human.
<ul>
<li>
This “virtualisation” of all the relations is produced from the present
evolution of capitalism, but simultaneously this virtualisation requires
the production and permanent improving of the goods capable of achieving
the perfect separation of the human being as well as the link between the
individuals maintained separated. It thus constitutes the icing on the
cake of democracy (2), the summit of the historic work of the commodity
society.</li>

<li>
These are obviously the ideal conditions for the blossoming of all these
false communities; communities that the atomised individuals see and live
the realization through the triumph of any flag: sports club, nation, ethnic
group, religion, and race…</li>

<li>
Associationism based on the material and universal interests of the proletariat
becomes not only more and more difficult, but especially “illogical”. In
a world where it became “natural” to fight for any specific flag it is
logically “anti-natural” that the human beings get organized according
to their vital and universal class interests, a fortiori to make an “utopian”
world revolution.</li>

<li>
The class unawareness is daily clearly visible. Any proletarian expression
finds the same international incomprehension when it is not simply liquidated
by the repression carried out by other proletarians in the service of any
international police.</li>

<li>
Although all this development of the bourgeois society doesn’t solve any
life problem of human beings under the “black sun capital”, although the
capitalist catastrophe doesn’t stop and won’t to deepen, every association
of proletarians all over the world aiming to strengthen, to develop centralization,
and internationalisation… in fact every association aiming at the constitution
of the proletariat as a party, is targeted by all the mechanisms of liquidation
and socialization.</li>
</ul>
Our close comrades, contacts, similar groups, daily live this reality.
We suffer in our own flesh this brutal contradiction between the aggravation
of all our living conditions and the brutal lack of proletarian associationism,
consciousness and centralization of our forces. This is the fundamental
reason it is very difficult to express currently the revolutionary perspective.
<p>So it was with our discussions, which led to the writing of our previous
editorial: while wanting to assert our perspective, they showed our own
weaknesses, i.e. those of our class and all the revolutionary minorities
in the present phase. They revealed that the issue of the revolutionary
perspective is no more today than yesterday an issue to be solved by any
party or organization; the same way they revealed that the problems we
also suffer in our own flesh are not particular problems of our group,
nor are to be solved by the simple will to do. These discussions sent us
again and again to look for solutions not in such or such recipe on the
activity or on the mottos to champion, as are doing all the opportunists
who end up being taken over by any reformist program (and ultimately for
socialization and the cult of individual freedom), but rather in the contradictions
peculiar to the capital’s functioning, in its inability to satisfy the
most elementary interests of human being.
<p>If our last editorial had especially emphasized the summits –in <i>absolute
</i>terms-
reached by the deterioration of the proletariat’s survival conditions in
the world (always more shanty towns, poisoning, drugs, atomisation, etc.),
it seems to us important (specifically in this text, in the light of the
development of the class struggles in 2007-2008), to stress on the increase
of brutal deteriorations –this time in <i>relative </i>terms- of proletarians’
survival conditions everywhere in the world, regardless of the levels reached.
Thus, the last explosion of prices for oil and foodstuffs was directly
translated into an attack of the standard of living –various degrees indeed-
of the whole proletarians in the world, attack that even didn’t spare the
less “underprivileged” sections. This massive and general attack of the
proletarians’ standard of living provoked, for the first time since a long
time ago, a reaction of the proletariat on a directly world scale, if not
in the homogeneity of its expressions (or even lesser in the recognition
of this uniqueness by the proletariat itself), at least in the simultaneity
in the revolt. The simplification of contradictions the revolutionaries
always talked about thus made a gigantic step. It seems to us important
to turn our attention somewhat to these events, as well as how the ruling
class expended a lot of effort and energy to contain and hide this process.
<h3>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">SOME ELEMENTS ON THE PRESENT STRUGGLES OF
OUR CLASS AND ON THE WAY OUR ENEMIES HIDE THEIR ESSENTIAL UNIQUENESS</font></u></h3>
For lack of being able to purely and simply hide the various reactions
of our class in the world the bourgeois media try to play their role of
capitalist order’s martinet (the Marxist-Leninist press fulfilling as usual
this dirty work with a great enthusiasm) while describing them as movements
that have nothing to do with each other, with a completely different nature
and origin. Where we see different expressions of a same proletariat’s
fundamental reaction against the attacks, in the most general sense, of
their survival conditions (exploitation, wages, wars, deportations, repression,
social putrefaction…) from world capital, the media (irrespective of which
side they belong to) persist in distinguishing and establishing some strict
separations between what they call:
<ol>
<li>
“Hunger riots” which affect about thirty countries of the so-called Third
World, building thus, according to them, an exploding belt that surrounds
the globe from latitude 30&deg; North until the equator. Are categorized
as such the proletariat’s reactions against the crisis in Mexico, in Haiti,
in a dozen of countries of Western and Central Africa (e.g. Guinea, Ivory
Coast, Nigeria, Senegal, Cameroon, Somalia, Sudan, etc.), in Egypt, in
the Indian peninsula (Pakistan, India, Bangladesh) and finally in Southeast
Asia (China, Vietnam, Thailand, etc.), and in Indonesia. These “hunger
riots” are described as the specific product of the maintenance of the
North-South trade unbalances inherited from the colonization, from the
Western Stock Markets speculation over the productions of “Third World”
countries, and from the destruction of local mixed farming, notably following
the WB’s and IMF’s so-called neo-colonialist policies, which condition
the granting of financial loans to single-crop farming for export products;</li>

<li>
Demonstrations “against the high cost of living” and strikes against the
reduction of the so-called “purchasing power” (3) (United States, Western
and Eastern Europe, some countries of Latin America);</li>

<li>
“Suburbs riots” in European countries and some countries of Latin America,
described as the expression of youth’s malaise, especially youngsters of
immigrant extraction and/or those left out of “the world of work” (4);</li>

<li>
“Terrorist attacks” and revolts against the military and other state and
state-like institutions in countries where the world centralization of
state terror is imposed on the basis of military occupation and/or humanitarian
operations (Haiti, Ivory Coast, Somalia, Guinea, Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan,
Palestine and other territories under state of Israel’s terror…) as well
as where the bourgeois repression develops its central strategy while confusing
systematically the movement of the proletariat and nationalist and/or Marxist-Leninist
organizations (Basque Country in Spain, Colombia, Chechnya, Nepal). (5)</li>
</ol>
On the basis of this separation, social democracy is going to sell us that
to each of these problems “with a specific nature and origin”, it is necessary
to bring specific solutions:
<ol>
<li>
International regulation of world economic policies, with regard to “hunger
riots”;</li>

<li>
Wage increase (revision of the calculation of the cost of living index)
and governmental policy of price control on vital commodities, housing
and energy, with regard to “demonstrations against the high cost of living”;</li>

<li>
Insertion of young people of immigrant extraction into the world of work,
with regard to “suburbs riots”;</li>

<li>
Pacification of the so-called ungovernable zones by military as well as
humanitarian interventions aiming to restore a “democratic process” of
decision and action.</li>
</ol>
These reformist and humanitarian solutions, pretending to improve for every
specific case the proletarian’s living conditions while preserving the
capitalist system, actually are just as much quarantine lines aiming to
prevent the development of the struggles of our class in the world.
<p>Moreover the very establishment of a strict distinction between “riots”
(to refer to the proletariat’s reactions in countries of the so-called
Third World, or in suburbs), “demonstrations” and “strikes” (to touch on
the proletarians’ reaction in the so-called developed countries) or “terrorist
attacks” (to refer to the proletariat’s reactions in the “ungovernable
zones” of the world) represents the first quarantine line against the unification
of the proletariat’s struggle in the world.
<p>What about the word “riot”? It is very distinctly and pejoratively connoted
by years of Social Democratic propaganda as referring to “the outburst
of the lowest instincts of human being”, the “archaic and primary” reaction
of “the masses”, before the development of the “workers’ movement” (i.e.
its containment and neutralization by Social Democracy). In the world of
citizens, this word means “uncivilized” or pre-democratic struggles. It
is systematically used to refer to proletarians’ struggles in the so-called
underdeveloped countries, in the Western suburbs, or even to designate
the workers’ actions considered as too much “wild”, contributing thus clearly
to maintain the ideology according to which these struggles correspond
so much to a completely different fight –of a lower rank in its shape as
well as in its objectives-, different from the one of the “working class”
of the Western countries. These terminological distinctions thus contribute
to maintain the ideology according to which the pacifist methods of demonstrations
and pseudo-strikes, imposed by Social Democracy, would be the shape of
struggle of the salaried workers of the so-called developed capitalist
countries and that this struggle doesn’t have anything in common with bursts
of anger –“spontaneous, disorganized and with ambiguous purposes”- from
suburbs “riffraff” or from “idle lumpenproletarians” in the so-called Third
World countries; it also doesn’t have anything in common with those who
“organize wildcat strikes and violent actions”, or with “terrorist” attacks
against military, political or economic structures of the state led by
“extremist groupuscules”.
<p>In the same way, while categorizing a certain number of reactions of
our class as “hunger revolts” and while labelling them as “Third World”,
one succeeded in making believe that those who are not hungry are not concerned,
that those who don’t live in the so-called Third World are not either.
The purpose to do this way is to hide the fact that it is the same capitalist
society that produces the most powerful computers, that builds the most
fantastic cities and weapons of massive destruction and, at the same time,
that produces starvation in the world, that decreases the real wage of
all the proletarians in the world. Thus we have to admit that if we talk
about food, as the real satisfaction of human needs –what corresponds at
the most general level of analysis of the societies-, it’s indeed the whole
of the proletarians who are “hungry” of real human food under the capitalist
mode of production. With the generalization of trashy food –emptied of
any essential trace element, which has lost its vitamins, toxic, etc.-
capital “starves” <i>substantially
</i>the whole of the proletarians who
are more and more victims of serious nutritional deficiencies everywhere
in the world, without any exception and especially not in the so-called
developed countries, where <i>fast food</i> rules supreme, i.e. “the food
that only serves to regenerate labour force the fastest possible”. This
is another aspect of the always more flagrant inability of capital to really
feed mankind, everywhere in the world.
<p>Finally, and this point is related to both first ones, all the terminology
of “under-developed”, “developing”, “emerging” countries or “Third World”,
aims to present these lands as being lesser capitalist, when actually famines
are the purest product of capitalism. While hiding the reasons one hides
the solutions: the destruction of capitalism. While particularizing the
problems of starvation –or the problems of the so-called Third World in
general- one hides the generalization of the capitalist attack against
the proletariat, the homogenisation of proletarians’ living conditions
at the international level, and obviously one also hides the common proletarian
nature of the attacks against capital and the state that are taking place
under our eyes.
<p>The use of all this terminology is not neutral. It simultaneously aims
at two purposes: to get rid of the general character of proletariat’s reactions,
to finish off with their revolutionary perspective against a global system
that attacks them.
<p>These clich&eacute;s carefully developed by the bourgeois media don’t
stand up to the analysis that we can make about these different movements
of struggle of the proletariat all over the world. Even through the bourgeois
information filter, it is not difficult to realize that:
<ol>
<li>
“Hunger riots” in the so-called under-developed countries are also marked
by strikes of salaried employees and that demonstrations targeted, as elsewhere,
structures of the state they have to face, including the international
humanitarian forces that support the local governments in their policies
of repression and maintenance of law and order;</li>

<li>
“Demonstrations and strikes against the high cost of living” by proletarians
in European countries have in several cases went beyond the level of pacifist
demonstrations and strikes organized by Social Democracy. During their
struggles, proletarians resorted to various direct actions and “wildcat
strikes”, which stopped the production, breaking thus the containment through
democratic procedures of social dialogue (e.g. Spanish fishermen blocked
up harbours, truck drivers held up highways in France, in Spain, etc.);</li>

<li>
Suburbs “rioters”, far from only tacking it on their neighbours’ cars and
bus shelters, as reported by the bourgeois media, actually attacked a great
number of targets that daily accomplishes the “big racket of capital” upon
our lives, showing so that the objectives of their struggle are much clearer
than the Leninists and company pretend to be, who see these “rioters” as
modern “lumpenproletarians”; and also showing that their struggle is straight
directed against the capital’s state and all its branches, against wage
labour, value: police stations, town halls, public services, law courts,
schools, parties offices –irrespective of which faction-, associations
offices, French Electricity and Gas Board agencies [EDF-GDF], electric
transformers, banks and cash dispensers, estate agencies, temping agencies,
jobcentres [ANPE], post offices, car dealers, shopping centres, fast food,
sports and arts centres, tourist information centres, agencies, media’s
vehicles and journalists, etc. (6)</li>

<li>
“Ungovernable zones” are actually real social powder kegs, and this for
years. Behind the veil of religious, nationalist or inter-ethnic conflicts
(7), the media hide a very tense social reality where working conditions,
wages and strong unemployment rate have and continue to provoke important
strikes and demonstrations of proletarians, violently repressed by the
currents governments. The social tensions exacerbation in these regions
sometimes created some pre-insurrectionary situations where proletarians
overtly confronted all the state forces, requiring from then on the intervention
of international forces (humanitarian and/or military ones) in order to
try to restore social order there.</li>
</ol>
Finally, it is also necessary to emphasize that some situations of struggle
correspond so few to one or the other of these patterns that the media
don’t succeed in stuff them into a precise category and consider them as
“uncategorizable”, like the struggles that develop since several years
in Haiti, Algeria, Bolivia, Chile, Mexico, etc. According to bourgeois
categories, it is about neither “under-developed” countries nor countries
at in open war. These struggles show nearly insurrectionary aspects going
greatly beyond the framework of wage struggles and suburban “riots”. Moreover
they assert themselves either in long-term or in continuity, by recurrence,
what is to be emphasized in this period of explosions of social unrest,
brutal as well as ephemeral. Through these examples, it also appears that
the radicalisation and the very development of the struggles make always
more difficult their falsification in the rigid categories explained above.

<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">Notes</font></u></h3>
(1) This involuntary ambiguousness against the mechanicist conceptions
in our previous editorial was still accentuated by the nearly systematic
use of the expression “capitalistic decomposition” instead of “deterioration
of the contradictions” that we usually use to mark, not because capital
should fall apart under our eyes, but rather because in the absence of
quantitative and qualitative development of proletarian struggle, the very
real exacerbation of the contradiction between capital’s needs and human
needs only turns always more against our class: massacres, wars, atomisation,
exploitation, starvation, cops, prison, control, generalized poisoning…
It is for us about asserting like revolutionaries always did that the catastrophe
is not only the capital’s future but also all its past and its present.
Moments of acceleration of this catastrophe are favourable moments to show
the real and only alternative, i.e. between catastrophe or revolution.
It doesn’t mark the end of class struggle (as the “decomposition” means
it in a mechanicist sense) but on the contrary the moment where it really
begins to be decided.
<br>(2) Some comrades warn us that “this icing on the cake” is not the
first one and that it won’t be surely the last. It is true, but it is also
true that all the innovations are nothing but always more the same thing,
that any “progress” can be only the modernized version of a thousand and
one glass jewelleries that the colonizers offered to the natives in return
for the liquidation of their life.
<br>(3) The expression “purchasing power”, in order to talk about the real
wage, i.e. the wage expressed in goods it allows to buy, isn’t quite innocent.
It is highly connoted and speaks for itself about how the state and especially
social democracy means to restrict the “power” of our class to the size
of a supermarket trolley. If the amount of real wage at such moment always
and really expresses a balance of forces between the classes, a level of
class struggle, on the contrary the very fact of purchasing commodities
(and selling our labour force previously) will never be the expression
of a “conquest” or a “power”, but rather the one of our enslavement.
<br>(4) For greater convenience we use these terms of “those left out”
or “victims of social exclusion”, but it is clear that for us no one is
“left out” (in the sense of being “rejected” or “expelled” outside) of
the capitalist mode of production, of the world of wage labour. All the
proletarians are free workers, dispossessed of the means of subsistence,
obliged to sell their labour force. In this comprehensive sense, the lack
of work and wage income is not an exclusion of the mercantile society,
but a second and even more violent bondage, the proletarian ending up without
a soil to work as well as without a wage.
<br>(5) Some more skilful media, lesser submissive to the servile reproduction
of the Pentagon’s official versions, and therefore more widely in Latin
America for example, make the distinction between (on one hand) the terrorism
as we describe here –justifying thus the anti-terrorist campaign of the
world state- and (on the other hand) the “guerrilla warfare” of “resistance
against the imperialism” of the USA like in Iraq, Afghanistan, Colombia,
ETA in Spain… what represents a new <i>media category</i>, i.e. a <i>partial
recognition</i> of the nature of these movements, but therefore also a
<i>subtler
overshadowing</i> of this nature.
<br>(6) Concerning these struggles and their targets, see the booklet in
French
<i>“C7 H16, special issue review, 2006”</i>, with subhead <i>“G
la rage… et je la garde”</i> [“IAM in a rage… and I keep it”], freely downloadable
(pdf for the booklet and mp3 for the “street-CD” attached) at the following
address: http://c7h16.internetdown.org/ – Contact: c7h16@internetdown.org/.
<br>(7) All these ideological dimensions obviously materialize physically,
against the proletariat, but they never represent the material basis of
social conflicts. It is about all these shitty bourgeois polarizations
in which the proletariat loses any autonomous action capacity when it gets
bogged down in them, and it gets bogged down in them when its struggle
remains internationally limited and isolated.
