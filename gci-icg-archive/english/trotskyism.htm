Trotsky is often considered as Stalin's enemy. In fact he was Stalin's
competitor. Let's explain:
<p>The opposition (that will later become trotskyist) appears in 26-27
as a (quite late) reaction to the counterrevolutionary position of "socialism
in one country". But this position of Trotsky will only be a theoretical
position in so far as Trotsky will always defend capitalism in Russia and
everywhere else in the world. Trotskyists will defend the participation
to the so-called "second" world war and to all the following ones. If in
'27, Trotsky's reaction to the Canton and Shanghai massacre of the insurrected
proletarians is correct, in total antagonism with this position, he will
support the massacres of the proletarians in Spain and critically support
all the left bourgeoisie initiatives.
<p>Inside the Third International he attacks the Left, calling them "anarchists"
or "adventurous", he lead the crushing of the proletarian insurrection
in Cronstadt, he impulsed the militarisation of labour, and praised the
Taylor system (increasing of exploitation of human labour),... In two words:
Trotsky always supported the development of capitalism. He never realised/understood
the transformation/liquidation of the proletarian organs of 1917 into organs
of management of capital. He was blind to the capitalist nature of the
relations of production in Russia.
<p>The communist revolution means the destruction of production, value,
the abolition of wage labour, total suppression of democracy, be it called
popular, direct, liberal or libertarian.
<p>Trotsky fights against the participation of the communists to the Kuomintang
(1923) and against the policy of the Third International which praised
the alliance with the Chinese bourgeoisie against the insurrected proletarians.
Correct! But he does not makes a principle out of this position, he does
not consider this position as something true always and everywhere, as
an important point of the communist programme: anti-frontism.
<p>In 1933, he wants that all the groups of the trotskyist "opposition"
enter the bourgeois social-democrat parties (the same he condemned in 1920)
to make "entryism". That is equivalent to trying to wake up a dead body.
We consider entryism is trying to conquest a cadaver from the inside! Trotskyist
organisations made entryism inside the organisations created under the
Vichy regime in France in order to "organize revolutionary nucleus"!!!
<p>Our criticisms globally concern the critical support to parliament,
ministries, elections,... the participation to imperialist conflicts supporting
the "weakest" imperialism (Russia, Tito, Ben Bella, Khomeyni, Allende,
Ho Chi Min,...) supporting national liberation struggles.
<p>We denounce the theory defending the existence of "degenerated worker
States". According to this point of view, in those States, the means of
production are "fair", and the means of distribution are "unfair". We consider
this as total bullshit! The production determines the essence, the very
nature of the distribution and all the ideological forms that justify the
later. In Russia as well as everywhere in the world economy is based on
the law of value, therefore, what is the difference? Nationalisation? State
property? No because it does not attack property. On the one hand, the
bourgeois property of the means of production is reinforced and more centralised,
on the other hand there is no change in the essence of the relations of
production.
<p>We also denounce the theory of the permanent revolution according to
which "the accomplishment of democratic tasks in bourgeois backward countries
"directly" leads them to the dictatorship of the proletariat which puts
the socialist tasks on the agenda." So making the bourgeois revolution
would automatically lead to making the proletarian revolution that would
put the finishing touches to the bourgeois revolution. That is how the
bourgeois revolution could "permanently" give birth to the proletarian
revolution, just as if the later was a simple and more or less mechanical
extension, continuation of the first.
<p>Proletarian revolution will destroy democracy, impose the proletarian
class power in order to abolish all classes and all powers. The fact that
capital always developed by poles of concentration that moved along the
centuries does contradict the fact that it is a worldwide relation of production
and that the proletarians have no country to defend, no homeland to die
for. National liberation, the "oppressed nations", the "socialist countries"
are bourgeois ideologies to prevent class war!
<p>And last point of the trotskyist theory we denounce: the transitional
programme.
<p>For Trotsky there are two programs: a minimum programme (economical
demands, immediate interests) and a maximum programme (political demands,
historical interests), and between them, there is a bridge: the transitional
program, the "preparation to the taking of the power". This transitional
program is the basis of the 4th International. It says that the productive
forces of humanity have stopped growing and that the objective basis of
capital is ready for revolution. What is missing is the subjective factor,
i.e: the revolutionary leadership. That is the role of the 4th International.
Separation between immediate and historical interests of the proletariat,
separation between the "masses" and the "leaders", the bellies and the
heads, the oppressed and the imperialist countries, the subjective and
the objective conditions, these counterrevolutionary theories serve as
life guard for capital.
<p>For us the transition between capital and communism will be the dictatorship
of the proletariat, and the transitional programme can only be the tasks
necessary to dictatorially destroy capital.
