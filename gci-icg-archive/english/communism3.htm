<font face="Comic Sans MS">We are publishing here a first attempt to summarize
our fundamental positions. We want to insist on the danger of using this
text as if it were a new bible, as a formal and eternal reference. We consider
this text as <u>a photograph</u> taken at a certain level of experience
of our group, knowing that we'll produce other materials, other texts which
will be at quite different levels of abstraction and concretisation.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">The I.C.G. bases its principal positions
on the historical experiences of the workers' movement:</font>
<ul>
<li>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The historical arch that relies primitive communism
to integral communism constitutes the whole cycle from which revolutionary
marxism draws the process that gives birth to the material conditions required
for the establishment of the world-wide human community. This society will
not be the end of history, but the beginning of the <u>conscious history
of the human species</u> through the abolition of classes, private property,
labour, state, exploitation, family...</font></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Capitalism differs from all previous modes of
production by its <u>universal nature</u> and by the simplification (exacerbation)
of <u>class contradictions</u>. Capitalism at the same time creates the
conditions for Communism and the force that will impose it: the proletariat,
the only class in human history to be exploited and revolutionary.</font></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The limit of Capital is Capital itself! Its
development necessarily implies the development of its contradictions (proletariat/bourgeoisie,
valorization/devalorization, productive forces/relations of productions,...)
and it determines, constitutes and develops the social force whose historical
mission it is to destroy the capitalist system: <u>the proletariat organized
and constituted as communist party</u>.</font></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Through the revolutionary dictatorship, through
the constitution of the world-wide proletarian State (semi-state), the
working class organises the destruction of any state and the abolition
of social classes by crushing, through red terror openly claimed and applied,
all attempts aiming at the restoration of the terrorist dictatorship of
the value. To bourgeois terror and terrorism, the proletariat opposes the
revolutionary terror.</font></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The proletariat is historically forced and determined
to organize itself as a class fighting consciously for the realization
of the communist programme. This is its tendency to constitute itself into
one conscious force, into the world-wide party, centralizing the most determined
and the most radical fractions of the proletariat.</font></li>
</ul>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">From these fundamental programmatical aspects,
checked by the experiences of revolution and counter-revolution, derive
a series of historical lessons that are valid yesterday, today as tomorrow!</font>
<ul>
<li>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Democracy cannot be reduced to a simple form
(parliamentary, fascist, socialist,...) of capitalist domination. Democracy
-force of atomization - affirms itself morre and more as <u>the very substance</u>
of capitalist dictatorship. Its development is directly linked to the development
of commodity-production; therefore the victory of communism implies the
destruction of democracy (including "workers' democracy") as the way of
life of Capital.</font></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The so-called socialist countries, blocs (Russia,
China, Cuba,...) are capitalist states where the dominant ideology only
adds some "marxist" expressions so as to hide their bourgeois character.
Where there is wage labour, there is Capital!</font></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">To protect itself from revolutionary assaults,
the bourgeoisie has always developed social-democratic and other left fractions
to serve as a rampart of the bourgeois state. The currents that support
(in a critical way or not) any of today's existing states (trotskyism,
maoism, third-world movements, anarchism,...) are just radicalised forms
of bourgeois socialism. The proletariat considers these pseudo-workers'
parties as the hitsquads of the radical fractions of the bourgeoisie.</font></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The communist movement characterises itself
by its permanent opposition to the bourgeois state, to all bourgeois parties
(all of them, whether they are legal or illegal, left or right). Against
parliamentarism and elections, it opposes <u>communist abstentionism</u>.</font></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">During the struggle, workers' associationism
opposes itself to all the organs of the capitalist state. The proletariat
organizes itself <u>outside and against</u> parliaments, unions, armies,...
Structures maintaining social peace don't have to be reformed, they must
be destroyed!</font></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The aim of the proletarian struggle is the generalization
of the insurrection to the whole planet, is the world-wide dictatorship
of the proletariat constituted into a party, is the social revolution affirming
itself with the generalized despotism of human needs against Capital and
all its laws of existence.</font></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Communism, as a movement opposes and excludes
from its very origins the country, the nation, the national struggle, as
well as all class collaboration. Against imperialist peace and war (=social
peace) it opposes revolutionary defeatism (=social war).</font></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The communist direction, an historical (and
non-immediate) product of the proletariat, has no interests opposed to
the rest of the class. Communists only distinguish themselves by their
actions in which they show themselves as the most determined elements and
in which they always put forward the interests of the whole working class.
They are the most consequent organized force in front of the necessity
for the communist movement to give itself a real direction and a single
and world-wide centralization. In other words, the party is the "prefiguration"
of the human world-wide community.</font></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">As a communist organization, the I.C.G. acts
in a conscious, voluntary and organized way to direct this process and
bring it to its term.</font></li>

For over a year strikes have continually broken out in South Africa's gold
and coal mines, car industry, etc. Rent strikes have spread throughout
townships and industrial suburbs. Laws on pass-control have been defied
by countless illegal immigrants. Teenagers have deserted schools and set
them on fire. They have attacked vehicles transporting scabs to work. Foodstores
have been looted; townhalls, churches, police stations have been sacked
and burnt down. Elections have been rejected and the "people's representatives"
have become the target of angry mobs while informers have been terrorized
when not executed. The thousands of death no longer inspire submission;
every funeral of assassinated proletarians turns into a demonstration against
the "peace of the tombs".
<p>Within the course of a year South Africa has been shaken all over by
this one movement that not only affected big industrial cities but also
remote bantoustans, dormitory-suburbs and most of the huge mining areas.
Workers' massive revolt against sacrifices has become the main axis around
which struggles develop. These struggles that the bourgeoisie can no longer
control are an extension as well as an advancement of the so-called Soweto-riots
(savagely put down - 6000 killed - by the State in '76). Today the bourgeois
security is irremediably endangered by the violent rupture of social peace.
<p>Confronted with proletarians' rejection of their miserable conditions
of life and their revolt against poverty the South African bourgeoisie
has no other choice but to repress these struggles violently while at the
same time calling upon people to fight for "more freedom", "more democracy",
"for the freedom of press", "of association", etc. This way the bourgeoisie
manages to present the proletarian struggle as a reaction to the racist
attitude of the South-African State. Such polarization assumes the shape
of apartheid or anti-apartheid, that are nothing else but two expressions
of one and the same reality, of one and the same bourgeois alternative.
<p>In order to take advantage of the struggles, the bourgeoisie mobilises
the proletarians on the issue of "Black Consciousness", of "Black people's
liberation", of anti-apartheid,...
<p>The cohesion with which world capitalism strives to establish a regime
of anti-apartheid is only being equalled by the eagerness each imperialistic
constellation display to restore order and stop proletarian struggle.
<p>While miners get surrounded by the army, while workers' living areas
get patrolled by the police, the "Black" leaders of the A.N.C., of the
U.D.F.,... negotiate with bosses and government representatives in order
to put an end to "all that violence". Proletarian blood is being sold by
these so-called revolutionary leaders. The crisis of the State in South
Africa is only a symptom of the difficulties world capitalism experiences
in enrolling proletarians behind measures of austerity and always worsening
conditions of survival.
<p>South Africa occupies a strategic position at the meeting point of three
oceans. Its industrial power, mainly concentrated in mines and agriculture,
equals that of the rest of the African continent. It is the first producer
of precious ores and a pole of the world market where capital has been
concentrated to an impressive extend. All these conditions have determined
the development of an extremely powerful and militarized State. The stability
of world capitalism has imposed a state of apartheid in South Africa (it
is not by accident that this racist State was accepted as a constitutional
regime just after the war in 1948) as the only way - thanks to social peace
that this way was achieved at little expense - of facing the strategic
battles that continually opposed imperialist powers. Anyway, the Allied
forces have never been embarrassed to help create a "racial state)" - what
they all are - and other concentration camps after having "freed the world
from barbarity" (sic).
<p>If capital backs apartheid or fascist regimes, it is mainly because
such regimes allow for a more important valorization (cheaper workforce):
this is its major care. At the same time capital never stops trying to
show its purity by defending the "world community of democratic interests"
(an ideology aimed at cementing the whole of society in order to prevent
a real understanding of our class interests). In fact, in South Africa
capital's interests are double: on the one hand capital requires an unceasing
increase in surplus value and on the other hand it must imperatively move
towards a State of anti-apartheid to try to restore law and order amongst
proletarians. This brings about dissensions between the various bourgeois
fractions in the world.
<p>Counter-revolution takes the shape of polarization not only as a cover
for the struggles between fractional interests that shake world capitalism
but also and in the first place as a means to stop the more and more threatening
waves of proletarian struggles. This polarization is based on always the
same obstacles continually faced by proletarians: racism, forced immigration,
police control, discriminations, persecutions,... When fighting against
pass-control, against deportations to the home-lands, against confinement
in town-ships, real concentration camps, or when squatting living places
that are forbidden for black people, the proletariat fights against the
social misery of this rotten society. Today's struggles are not engendered
by the need for "Black liberation" nor by racial antagonism but by the
need for liberation from the links that enchain proletarians to the mercy
of capital's needs.
<p>The fact that these struggles get a strong echo amongst clandestine
immigrants, unemployed and even amongst young whites, illustrates the force
of the movement which, instead of being limited to factories, has touched
all categories of proletarians and all places of capital reproduction,
expressing the general willingness of the proletariat movement to refuse
all separations and to keep united in spite of the anti-apartheid movement
that tries to hide this reality and to break it down. By claiming the "law
of the majority", universal suffrage, the anti-apartheid leaders invite
proletarians to give up social struggle and to join them in the "paradise"
of democratic rights (for more details on this subject see "Against the
myth of democratic rights and liberties", Communism n<font face="Courier New">?</font>1).
With their universal suffrage they try to impose black nationalism claiming
for a government by African! They use all the power of their organizations,
supported by different world capitalist fractions, to try to restrain revolutionary
agitation (that attacks all defenders of order, black and white) and to
lock it up in the prisons of African nationalism!
<p>The A.N.C. and U.D.F. militants, the union leaders, the Nobel prize
of social peace,... they all display their terrorist arsenal against "refractory"
proletarians and other "provokers" who threaten the peaceful development
of the negotiations for conciliation, for "opening" towards the government
and the bosses representatives.
<p>Trade-unions may state their regrets about the outcome of the miners'
strike at the end of last August at a time when they actively prepared
together with the government the army's demonstration of intimidation against
strikers as the only "glorious" outcome possible to make proletarians accept
the successive refusals of their claims -amongst which some concerned a
rise in wages judged "unrealistic" by the unions as well as the re-engagement
of proletarians sacked because of their sabotage actions anti-scab violence-.
The anti-white radicalism of certain A.N.C. branches such like the P.A.C.,
as well as the democretinism of trade-unions and pacifists, is just another
way of sabotaging the rising class-movement by trying to link proletarians
to a patriotic army, organ of promotion for imperialistic war and massacres
(bourgeois attempt to get rid of class contradictions). The pious calls
for justice and for "black people's right" (approved by all right-thinking
humanitarians) express the pacifist ideology, the violence and the "whites"
terror with which the South African bourgeoisie represses the revolutionary
vanguard minorities and tries to counter the extension and the organization
of different struggle practices that constitute the only alternative for
the proletariat.
<p>Apartheid and anti-apartheid both reinforce the South African bourgeoisie;
they bring about divisions, isolation and weakening amongst the worlds
proletariat.
<p>In order to be able to grant to the South African state the help of
international capitalism, the bourgeoisie with its press, its lawyers,
its churches of all religions, its many friends of man and earth, accomplishes
its dirty job of turning proletarians away from the struggles of their
class brothers: this is the only way for the bourgeoisie to stop the revolutionary
blaze that is threatening them.
<p>The corollary of this polarization is the organization and social function
not only of anti-apartheid campaigns but also of pacifism itself with such
masquerades as the "Band Aid" that only serve the purpose of concealing
our real class interests so as to strengthen social peace. The anti-apartheid
campaigns make the proletariat all over the world believe that those "poor
blacks" just have to fight against one "type of regime" and not against
world capital.
<p>By presenting these social struggles as specific to Africans, the world
state manages to prevent all real class solidarity from coming up and all
proletarian internationalism to develop. The proletariat, struggling for
its own interests and against austerity, rejects all national solidarity
and all cross-class unity. In South Africa, through their hard and violent
struggles proletarians try to break the nationalist frontiers. Even though
their movement is still marked by weakness mainly due to their isolation,
they sabotage the national economy and attack law and order for the sake
of their own class interests. To the boycott of elections by anti-apartheid
reformists, proletarians have answered by sabotaging the electoral truce
and by direct action against the state. With its strikes and never ending
riots the proletariat hasn't tried to "overthrow a government" but has
shaken the social domination of capital and has denied all bourgeois fractions
the capacity of ruling. To the violent police interventions and to the
pacific "framing" of the movement by unions and churches, the proletariat
has answered with the vital necessity of revolutionary violence to protect
the workers' demonstrations from repression, to counter the action of scabs
and informers and to prevent mass lock-out and dismissals (1700 miners
are threatened with sacking for having been on strike; others have been
dismissed for sabotage actions).
<p>Our comrades' struggle in South Africa aims at destroying the frontiers,
ideologies, racism,... that are continually used by the state in order
to separate us. Their struggles show our common class interests as opposed
to sacrifices and austerity. It is our duty to develop here the only real
solidarity with this struggle: the merciless fight against austerity, against
misery and against social peace. In other words, let's fight here and everywhere
for the same interests as those for which our comrades in South Africa
attack
the world capitalist state!

From every side, we see predatories appearing, swooping time after time
to pillage, devour, distort and falsify the revolutionary programme into
a disgusting counter-revolutionary mish-mash they call "Marxism": for example
Trotskyists who make a pilgrimage across Europe (say from Treves to London)
to put upon Marx's tomb ex-voto's in the form of "transitional programmes";
also, overtly bourgeois papers that salute the memory of that "great thinker",
"economist", "sociologist", "historian", "journalist",... for which certain
parts of his masterwork would still be relevant today.
<p>The palm of these hypocritically recuperative policies nevertheless
comes to all regimes (two thirds of this rotten humanity) who call themselves
"Marxists", "Marxist-Leninists", "Socialists" indeed "Communists" all who
with the centenary of the death of Marx (1883) stage one more morbid spectacle
for the glory of capitalism, for the glory of what Marx fought against
all his life.
<p>In the same way that capital defines itself by the ruthless dictatorship
of dead, objectified labour on living labour, by the vampire-like process
that can only survive by sucking human life for the sake of value valorizing
itself, the capitalist social relationship also expresses itself at a superstructural
level by the infamous dictatorship of mummified walking corpses, inoffensive
icons presented to the eyes of the masses in order to cynically exorcize
their non-life, to stuck them still a little bit more to the rock of capitalist
exploitation.
<p>The more capitalism sinks (and the more it develops itself) in its mortal
contradictions, the more it represents itself in caricature, affirming
its "working", "communist" image,... which is in fact only the transformation
in mits contrary of communism, the movement of which tears out the entrails
of capital more and more, menacing capitalist society always more mortally.
If at the beginning of its reign, the simple word of "communism" made capital
tremble with fear, in the course of its development capital has exorcized
that fear by representing itself as being not only the incarnated happiness,
the freedom in act,... but also the "finally human society", "realised
communism".
<p>The supreme myth of capital is its pretension to have achieved communism
through its fictitious community: democracy. This myth is subtended by
the fact that it's capital itself that has integrally socialized the production
(and consequently the reproduction of immediate living) and therefore has
realised the programme of bourgeois socialism, in any kind of form, fascist,
stalinist or parliamentary (1).
<p>It is this always more developed, more contradictory world-wide capitalist
system that generates communism each time as a more ineluctable, historical
necessity, as an already accomplished fact. The movement of capital would
like to achieve communism (just like the exchange-value "would like" to
autonomise itself totally from the use-value) without destroying itself:
that is its utopia. Only the proletariat organised as a class, hence as
a party, is able to impose communism to humanity by destroying capital
totally, and by negating itself as an exploited class: such is the realised
utopia, and such is the programme of revolutionary communism.
<p>Only the proletariat constituted as an autonomous class, thus organised
and directed through its party is able to kick out putrefied capitalism
which corrupts more and more all that is human in man and is able to achieve
the human global community (negation of the negation). Consequently, the
utopia of capital is to exist without any contradictions, thus only existing
as a positive pole, without the party of its destruction, without the proletarian
party (2). It's in the name of this utopia that capital goes to the extend
of privatively appropriating the corpse of Marx, which for a long time
already is being nibbled by the worms of social reformism. In the cabaret
of capital, the mummified Marx finds himself on the same alter as Jesus
Christ or Gandhi.
<p>As in China where on innumerable posters Marx has been depicted slant-eyed,
the universal bourgeoisie only represents Marx as just another tentative
to reform the world, this is to say that he is made at the same time more
inhuman and more acceptable in the eyes of the exploited. Against this
Marx, posthumous super-start well placed in the hit-parade of ideologies,
we oppose the militant Marx, Marx as the genious and modest incarnation
of the revolutionary programme existing impersonally as much before as
after his death.
<p>"Communism is a social material force which subjugates our intelligence,
captivates our feelings and achieves the union of our conscience and our
reason. It's a chain from which nobody can free us without breaking our
hearts. It's a demon from which man can only triumph by submitting himself
to it." (Marx)
<p>All the devotees of the capitalist cause will always present the "individual"
Marx as a "thinker" more or less intelligent, as a "philosopher", a "sociologist",...
and put him in one or another of these narrow-minded categories of these
so-called sciences. For us, Marx is first of all a militant worker, an
eager combatant defending the cause of the liberation of humanity. Even
if at the beginning of his action, Marx passed through democratic liberalism
(period of the "Rheinische Zeitung" 1842-43) and through the groups of
the hegelian left (B.Bauer and consorts), he broke very soon with all these
currents of the radical bourgeoisie to fully adhere to the cause of communism,
to the cause of the complete destruction of the "civil society", of bourgeois
society. It's through the fundamental texts such as "The Jewish question"
and "The Manuscripts of 1844" that Marx breaks definitely with the bourgeois
point of view of democracy and takes up the fully proletarian point of
view of communism (3).
<p>"Indeed the perfect Christian state is not the so-called Christian state
which recognizes Christianity as its foundation, as the state religion,
and which therefore excludes other religions. The perfect state is rather
the atheist state, the democratic state, the state which relegates religion
to the level of the other elements of civil society..." "Political democracy
is Christian in as much as it regards man - not just one man but all men
- as a sovereign and supreme being; but maan in his uncultivated, unsocial
aspect, man in his contingent existence, man just as he is, man as he has
been corrupted, lost to himself, sold, and exposed to the rule of inhuman
conditions and elements by the enthe organization of our society - in a
word, man who is not yet a true species-being. The sovereignty of man -
but of a man as an alien being distinct from actual man - is the fantasy,
the dream, the postulate of Christianity, whereas in democracy it is a
present an material reality, a secular maxim." "Hence man was not freed
from religion - he received the freedom of religion. He was not freed from
property - he received the freedom of property. He was not freed from egoism
of trade - he received the freedom to engage in trade." (Marx - "The Jewish
question")
<p>It's in this text that Marx authoritatively threw, polemizing against
Bauer, the programmatic bases of the fight to death against the bourgeois
state, thus against democracy, a position which he and Engels maintained
during their whole life-times: "Our final objective is the suppression
of all states, and consequently of democracy." (Engels - 1894)
<p>And in a concomitant way to those anti-state and anti-democratic aphorisms,
Marx defined the solution of human alienation (extraenization) (4), the
solution of all contradictions which shake the world in which we are living:
communism.
<p>"...it is the genuine resolution of the conflict between man and nature
and between man and man, the true resolution of the strife between existence
and essence, between objectification and self-confirmation, between freedom
and necessity, between the individual and the species. Communism is the
riddle of history solved, and it knows itself to be this solution." (Marx
- "Manuscripts of 1844")
<p>From the very moment of this adhesion to the communist point of view,
the masterwork of Marx will always affirm itself as a totality, as a critical
whole where, if it develops such or such a question, at such or such a
level of abstraction, it remains always from the point of view of the totality
(for which Marx drew up multiple plans, but as we know he only managed
to produce one tiny part of what he'd intended). The point of view and
the method are the central axis that Marx maintained throughout his whole
existence. The whole power of his masterwork resides in this totality,
in the invariance of his critical method of investigation (5) always put
at the service of the denunciation of the transitory character of capitalism
and consequently of the ineluctable advent of communism.
<p>So it's not by mere "chance" that all stalinists, democrats or other
shitheads have always tried to scientifically destroy the totality of the
masterwork of Marx, and tried to find contradictions where there were only
different levels of abstraction merely opposing certain passages extracted
from their context with the totality of Marx's militant activity. Such
is amongst others, the "famous" and false "contradiction" between the theory
of value especially developed in the first volume of "Capital" and the
theory of "prices of production" in "Capital" - Vol 3 (which all things
considered was published by Engels/Kautsky). Even more famous is the polemic
on the pseudo "epistomologic cut" between the young hegelian utopian Marx
and the mature, serious, scientific and non-revolutionary Marx (!), the
putrid theory which gave such notoriety to the neo-stalinist Althusser
and all his staff of marxologues who were paid especially to cut Marx up
like a vulgar sausage, and to get rid of all the subversive contents of
his masterwork, leaving only the "scientific and objective" and consequently
bourgeois analyses (cf. the Poulantzas, Mandel, Harnecker, Ellenstein,...)(6).
<p>The masterwork of Marx can only be understood as an attack, a criticism
of the whole bourgeois society, or as Marx stated it himself about the
publication of "Capital": "The most terrible missile ever to be launched
in the face of the bourgeoisie" (Marx to J.P.H. Becker - 1867). And when
Marx taken so fully the side of communism it's also by socially defining
the people who are the only ones able to achieve it: the modern proletarians.
<p>Thus it's not by conceiving communism as an ideal to aim at, but by
conceiving it as the movement of dissolution of the established order,
movement that is proceeding in front of our eyes; as well as by determining
the people who are forced to impose it, that Marx accomplishes the rupture
with the utopian socialists (Fourier, Owen), inventors of systems who could
not see communism as a real movement, as a social, acting force proceeding
in reality. It is not in philosophy, neither in science and even less in
economy that Marx looks for the essential definition of the people historically
determined to impose communism by the violence of their class; Marx defines
the proletariat by its historical function; he defines the proletariat
as the gravedigger of the old world, as the class which has nothing to
lose and everything to gain or win. In opposition to the delirium of "workerists"
Marx defines the revolutionary class as the one which, in reality is the
dissolution of established order, the one which by its increasing force
in confrontation against the bourgeois state, always re-affirms more clearly
its subversive and revolutionary character.
<p>"...a class with radical chains, a class of civil society which is not
a class of civil society, a class which is the dissolution of all classes,
a sphere which has a universal character because of its universal suffering
and which lays claim to no particular right because the wrong it suffers
is not a particular wrong but wrong in general, a sphere of society which
can no longer lay claim to a historical title but merely to a human one,
which does not stand in one-sided opposition to the premise of the state,
and finally a sphere which cannot emancipate itself without emancipating
itself from - and thereby emancipating - all the other spheres of society,
which is, in a word, a total loss of humanity and can therefore redeem
itself only through the total redemption of humanity. This dissolution
of society as a particular class is the proletariat." (Marx - Critique
of Hegel's philosophy of right)
<p>The adhesion of Marx to communism is consequently in no way an adhesion
to a new school of thought, philosophy, religion or sect. When he is adopting
the communist point of view, and this until his death, it's by understanding
in which way communism is an already existing movement carried by the revolutionary
proletariat (episode of the Silesian workers' revolt), a movement that
he'll always strife to direct, to organise, to make stronger as much organizationally
as programmatically.
<p>In that sense the masterwork of Marx is before anything a work of the
party, work of the impersonal collectivity that will impose communism.
Once he's clearly situated in the proletarian camp, Marx will work to always
make his basic thesis more precise, solid and operational and that, by
pitilessly criticizing all the elements which were impeding the understanding
of the world from the communist point of view, and firstly, the many ideologies
that the bourgeoisie forged for itself to justify its class domination,
ideologies that call themselves philosophy, religion, history, economy,...
So Marx didn't become a communist because he would have studied "scientifically
and objectively" the different aspects of human knowledge, but quite to
the contrary, it's because he was already a communist that he succeeded
in totally demolishing all different bourgeois sciences, and that he managed,
by demonstrating their narrow-minded and transitory character, to anticipate
the coming of a world without any classes, any state, any money,...
<p>"Each method is necessarily linked to the being of its corresponding
class." (Lukacs)
<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">Marx: militant of the Communist Party</font></u></h2>
In all Marx's activities theory and practice were always nothing else but
two abstractions on different levels of an organic entity. Marx himself
is the expression of this totality that is clearly defined by the word
"PRAXIS" and in which action and theory can never be dissociated without
misrepresenting the totality that these two words are unable to express.
It's in this sense that Marx is first of all a communist militant who applied
to all aspects of his activity, the same method to reach the same aim:
the liberation of the human race. As Marx stated in his thesis on Feuerbach,
written in Brussels in 1845:
<p>"The coincidence of the change of circumstances and of human activity
or of self-transformation can only be rationally understood as a revolutionary
practice."
<p>In the same way, the life and work of Marx can only be understood as
a revolutionary practice. And this understanding can only be the work of
groups, individuals,... placing themselves on the same path as Marx: the
path of communism, the path of the communist party.
<p>It is during this same period, after having constituted together with
some comrades a "committee of communist correspondence" (1846), that Marx
and Engels are joining the "Communist League". This adhesion is also a
fight against all the archaic forms of communism (Weitling) and against
the influences of the bourgeois-socialists. Marx very soon will assume
a role of direction of the League and he'll be in charge of completely
reorganising it. He'll draw up its statutes, as well as a new platform.
The first article of these new statutes affirms clearly the aim of communists:
"the aim of the League is the overthrow of the bourgeoisie, the domination
of the proletariat, the abolition of old bourgeois society based on class
antagonisms and the instauration of a new society without classes and without
private property."
<p>The second article specifies the militant requirements:
<p>"Joining conditions are as follows:
<br>- a kind of life and activity according to that aim;
<br>- revolutionary vigour and ardour for propaganda;
<br>- to make profession of communism."
<p>Within the League and later on within the International Workingmen's
Association, Marx work will be to transform this "contingent and limited
organization" into a real world-wide organization; this implied a break
with the utopian conceptions that still existed to a large extend within
the workers' movement. In order to carry out these tasks and after a first
project by Engels (see the profession of faith in communism drawn up by
Engels and that still bore to a large extend the mark of old utopian formulas)
Marx accepts to draw up a new platform for the League, giving it immediately
historical contents. The importance of this text is such that it will not
be called the "Manifesto of the League" but will be given the much more
fundamental title of "The Manifesto of the Communist Party" (drawn up in
1847 and published in 1848).
<p>Indeed, as we already stated in another article (7), the Manifesto and
other texts by Marx-Engels are directly texts of the party, essential expressions
of the communist programme.
<p>This programme of the revolutionary class cannot be reduced to one text
or another, still less to the platform of some formal organization. On
the contrary, the communist programme affirms itself as a "PRAXIS", as
a movement of confrontation with the bourgeois state, and some texts of
it express more synthetically in a more global way the communist aim and
movement. The programme is an invariant enthety that cannot be identified
with one of its written or theoretical expressions. It is a totality that
cannot be dissociated and that can only be understood as such. In this
sense, the Manifesto of the Communist Party is a brilliant example, because
it affirms itself beyond all temporal and geographical contingencies; it
is directly in its enthety, one of the clearest synthesis of the invariant
programme of the workers' movement. Nobody, except idiots, would dare to
limit the expressions of the revolutionary programme to the Manifesto of
1847 only. Once more here we can oppose the "praxis" of Marx to all his
would-be followers for whom the communist movement and its organization
into party could not possibly exist without a text called "programme" or
"platform". Of the three fundamental texts: "The Manifesto", "Capital"
and "Grundrisse", there is none which could be a better or more complete
expression of the communist programme. Each of these texts, like all other
communist texts passed and still to come, express a certain level of abstraction,
a certain level of understanding of the programmatic enthety and are more
or less developed expressions of the invariant programme. These texts that
are impersonal achievements of the party, have indeed different functions:
"The Manifesto" is more a summary of the fundamental positions of communists
in front of the bourgeoisie, while "Capital" is since the implacable demonstration
of the catastrophic end of the capitalist mode of production and therefore
of the inevitable coining of communism, but both of them are essential
expressions of a same and single programme: communism.
<p>The whole history of the communist movement shows us that some texts,
some individuals, or some actions,... that are often considered by "Marxists"
and other academics of less importance, or even as being insignificant,
in fact express superior levels of synthesis and conception; and often
the production of texts supposedly expressing the summary, a definite codification
of communism, represented in fact a set-back of the workers' movement and
the crystallization of counterrevolutionary positions. It was Kautsky (and
his followers Plekhanov,...) who was considered as an "orthodox Marxist",
as the only depository of "Marxist truth" while all the authentic revolutionary
expressions were distorted and rejected as "radicalism", "anarchism",...
(e.g. Domela Nieuwenhuis who denounces in his book "Socialism in danger"
the Second International). More clear still is the complete black-out on
the experiences and the history of left communists, as well German, Italian
as Belgian, Mexican or Hindu or still the lies and filth poured on communist
militants, on such revolutionaries as Blanqui, Gorter, Miasnikov, Vercesi
or Korsch. Who would dare to pretend that the Third Communist International
didn't exist before 1928!? But it was only on the VIth world congress on
September 1sr, 1928 that the C.I. finally adopted its programme, written
by Boukharine; by that rime the C.I. had become nothing else but the formalization
of the whole process of degeneration, the crystallization of the counter-revolutionary
positions that had affirmed themselves always more clearly after each congress.
Our care here is not to disparage the efforts to produce, at certain moments,
documents that would state "the fundamental positions of communists" or
that would outline the general political orientations, quite to the contrary,
we want to denounce the very widespread myth according to which a communist
organization wouldn't exist, wouldn't have a coherence and wouldn't be
in the historical line of the party if it hadn't a sacred text called "platform"
or "programme", pretending at the same time to compare, voluntary or not,
these organizational positions to the historical programme of the proletariat.
We, communists, don't refer exclusively to this or that sacred or pretended
so, text, be it the Manifesto, the Rome thesis or another platform of any
formal group, in front of which the revolutionary proletariat would have
to fall on its knees. We refer to an organic totality where each expression
of the communist movement finds its place insofar that it manages to represent
the best it can the historical arch from the natural community to full
communism and this, independently of all immediatist, contingent or limited
vision. It's because they really are texts of the party, that the works
of Marx, with the Manifesto, are always more a guide for our action. But
already Engels warned the readers against the insufficiencies of the Manifesto
and it is well known that Marx, after the experience of the Paris' Commune
indicated the necessity to change the formula "to conquer the democratic
state" by the need of destroying it from top to bottom.
<p>"One thing especially was proved by the Commune, that the working class
cannot simply lay hold of the ready-made state machinery and wield it for
its own purpose. Also if the remarks on the relation of the communists
to the various opposition parties although in principle are still correct,
yet in practice are antiquated, because the political situation has been
enthely changed and the progress of history has swept from off the earth
the greater portion of the political parties there enumerated. But the
Manifesto still is a historical document which we have no longer any right
to alter." (Engels - Preface to the English edition of the Manifesto -
1888)
<p>So for the first time, with the Manifesto, the fundamental positions
of communists were explained in a very explicit and synthetic way. Marx
and Engels, during their whole life-times not only developed, improved
and clarified the main positions enunciated in this text, but at every
moment, they'll try to direct the forces that are historically determined
to realise the communist revolution. As the Manifesto stated:
<p>"It is high time that the communists explain to the whole world their
conceptions, their aims, their tendencies and that they oppose against
the legends of the communist spectre a Manifesto of the party itself."
<p>Each time that a revolutionary period arrived, Marx tried to organise,
to direct the movement, as well during the movements of 1848 (see "the
class-struggles in France") when several times Marx risked his own skin,
as later on during the foundation (1864) of the International Workingmen's
Association, better known as the First International that took up as its
main countersign the famous phrase of the Manifesto: "Workingmen of all
countries, unite!" and which was rightly considered as the instigator,
as the real political direction of the Paris Commune - 1871 (while the
formal direction - the Central Committee of the Commune oscillated between
the workers' interests and capitulation in front of the enemy). On the
other hand, Marx took advantage of each period of withdrawal, of each period
when counter-revolution completely dominated (e.g. from 1850 to 1864) to
go deeply into the programmatical basis of the movement even if this meant
being at counter-current of the still existing formal organizations. It
is this position, at counter-current, that Engels vehemently expresses
in a letter to Marx:
<p>"How could we possibly be "a party" while we run away from all official
nominations? Do we care about a party while we spit on popularity, while
we doubt of ourselves as soon as we begin to become popular? Do we care
about "a party" i.e. a flock of donkeys who believe in us because they
think we belong to their species? It won't be a loss, indeed, when they
will cease to consider us as the 'true expression' of that bunch of narrow-minds
to which we have been associated for the last couple of years." (Engels)
<p>What a sane vigour of class interest this excerpt expresses, it's a
slash in the face of all those pseudo-partyists, guardians above all of
the fetishism of formal organizations! What a clear affirmation of the
necessary work of the party, obscure and unpopular work, mostly heaped
with calumnies and abuse by all these gentlemen preoccupied above all with
their own future! The fundamental understanding of the tasks communists
have to assume permanently is clearly included in Marx' practice: at one
and the same time the tasks of affirmation and deepening of the revolutionary
programme and also, when the material conditions allow for it, the tasks
of organization, of direction of the movements taking place in front of
our eyes. That's why, when the movement was beaten and counter-revolution
reigned, Marx, each time, without ever abandoning the work of the party,
was the prime mover of the dissolution of the formal organization (the
league, the I.W.A.) before these would pass to the counter-revolution.
But each time a wave of revolution flared up, Marx tried to give a direction
to this movement, to organise it in the perspective of its international
unification, in the perspective of communism. That's why, independently
of his adhesion to this or that group, Marx has always worked in the historical
line of the party, was always a militant of the communist party.
<p>"Above all, Marx was a revolutionary." (Engels - March 17th, 1883 -
oration on Marx's tomb.)
<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">Marx and the invariance of Marxism</font></u></h2>
As we have already seen in this text, counter-revolution will always try
to denature, to pillage the revolutionary Marx, to deprive him from his
subversive contents so as to keep only the image of a utopian reformer,
full of good intentions. But this falsification, this depreciation not
only takes the form of an explicit rejection of the revolutionary conclusions
of Marx, of his necrology of capital so as to retain only a simple biology
(the social-democratic, reformist and social-christian tradition), but
can also take the complementary form of a formal assertion of "orthodox
Marxism" while advancing contingent restrictions so as to more easily deny
the validity of the fundamental principles. Such is the work of the "orthodoxy"
of Kautsky, of the "formal invariance" (Stalinist, Trotskyist and Bordiguist
tradition) against which the freedom of criticism can't propose any solution
but the renunciation of the principles for the benefit of some innovations
and other "transcendencies" that place themselves out of the historic line
of the communist programme, and against which we can only hold up the real
invariance, the real orthodoxy: the invariance of the class and of its
own method:
<p>"The path of consciousness in the historical process does not become
smoother quite to the contrary, it becomes more and more arduous and requires
an always bigger responsibility. The function of orthodox Marxism - beyond
revisionism and utopism - is not the liquidation, once and for all, of
all false tendencies; it is the incessant struggle always renewed against
the perverted influences of the forms of bourgeois thought on the thought
of the proletariat. This orthodoxy is not the guardian of traditions but
the messenger always on alert of the relation between the present instant
and its tasks in keeping with the totality of the historic process." (Lukacs
- "What is orthodox Marxism" - 1919. Our ttranslation)
<p>This fundamental question of real invariance can he exemplified through
all of the communist positions. The Manifesto of the communist party declares:
"the communists are further reproached with desiring to abolish countries
and nationality. The workingmen have no country. We cannot take from them
what they have not got." Such is the affirmation of the real invariance
of the workers' movement: never, the revolutionary proletariat has a home-country,
a nationality. Its internationalist character is directly contained in
its very essence itself. The proletariat constitutes itself as a class,
that is to say, as an historical and world-wide totality - organic centralism,
centralization in time and space.
<p>And when workers fight for their country, for a nationality, it means
essentially that the proletariat does not exist as a class anymore (e.g.
situations of imperialist war during their first stage), it means that
if atomized proletarians do have a country, it can only be as citizens,
as members of bourgeois society, and not as grave-diggers of the old world.
The point of view of communism is invariant: either the proletariat, by
its tendential constitution as a class, and therefore as a party, realizes
its universal and internationalist essence - the workingmen have no country
-; or the proletariat is beaten by counterr-revolution and cannot exist
as a class anymore; what will be left are atomized individuals totally
submitted to the bourgeois ideology of the nation, the country (8). To
this, all "orthodox", all "invariants",... will, while formally maintaining
the aphorism: "the workingmen have no country", will deny this immediately
after by introducing a multitude of restrictions: "the period", "the particular
case", "the specific conditions", that invalidate the communist affirmation.
Nevertheless they'll all pretend to have respected word for word a text
that this way has become sacred and sanctified.
<p>This process of "aspiration" of the subversive contents so as to retain
only the revolutionary phrase, finds a material base in the texts and confusions
of Marx himself. That's why, after stating that the proletariat does not
have a home-country, all his would-be disciples will largely dissert about
the following sentence: "Since the proletariat must first of all acquire
political supremacy, must rise to be the leading class of the nation, must
constitute itself the nation, it is, so far, itself national, though not
in the bourgeois sense of the word." Obviously this sentence is in contradiction
with the programmatic affirmation preceding it, likewise it reflects the
confused comprehension of the "conquest of political power" (acquire political
supremacy) that later on was to be replaced by Marx himself with the vision
of the necessary destruction of the bourgeois state. Therefore two wrong
attitudes will be developed on the base of this contradiction of Marx:
on the one hand the modernist, innovative attitude of rejection of all
programmatical expressions on pretext that some formulations are confused
(or totally wrong) and are still marked by the visions of the enemy; on
the other hand, the approval of all the sentences signifying the adding
up of contradictory positions, which comes down to adopting the counter-revolutionary
position. After having thrown out nationalism through the door, they let
it in again through the window! This is how even the Manifesto has been
used and probably still will be used to justify capitalist war and the
worst nationalist and patriotic delirium.
<p>However, the whole history of our class (1789, 1848, 1871, 1905, 1917,
1927, 1936,... 1983,...) proves each time more clearly, since its beginning
until today, the validity of the only internationalist, anti-nationalistic
and anti-patriotic principled position.
<p>"It follows from this disastrous experience that when the proletariat
starts defending "its country", "the oppressed nation", it obtains only
one goal, i.e. the reinforcement of its own bourgeoisie (...) The proletariat
develops its movement, makes its revolution as a class. Not as a nation."
("L'ouvrier communiste" No 2/3 October 1929.)
<p>Once again, this historical position of communists had already been
clearly affirmed by Marx (even though once again our "orthodox", "invariants",...
will use still other sentences or texts by Marx that occasionally affirm
the contrary):
<p>"The nationality of the worker is not French, nor English neither German,
it is work, free slavery, the bargaining of oneself. His government is
not French, nor English neither German, it is capital. His native atmosphere
is not French, nor English neither German. It is the atmosphere of the
factory. The soil that belongs to him is not French soil, nor English and
neither German, it is some feet under the earth." (Marx - Critique of national
economy - 1845. Our translation)
<p>Marx' work (and that's why we're interested in it) is a fantastic synthesis
of the positions that, historically, differentiate the proletariat from
the bourgeoisie. This synthesis, on most questions, remains unequalled,
Marx having once and for all outlined the main positions of the communist
programme. We've seen how the international and internationalist character
of the proletariat clearly affirmed itself which constitutes the very base
for the comprehension of the revolution to be a world-wide process. In
the same way we can take each one of the fundamental questions of the revolutionary
programme, each question that still today constitutes the frontier between
the interests of the proletariat and those of the bourgeoisie, and we can
see how Marx has magnificently defined the "line and march, the conditions
and the ultimate general results of the proletarian movement" (the Manifesto).
<p>On the central question of the state. Marx, as his friend Engels, has
defined in the most clear way, the imperious necessity of the destruction
from top to bottom of the bourgeois state, and the rejection of the deadly
illusion of conquering or occupying it (cf. "The State and Revolution"
by Lenin). Once this destruction of the bourgeois state accomplished, there
will be period of transition when the proletariat organised as the ruling
class imposes its class-dictatorship for the abolition of wage labour.
<p>"Between capitalist and communist society stands a period of revolutionary
transformation of the first one into the second. To this corresponds a
period of political transition when the state can be nothing else but the
revolutionary dictatorship of the proletariat". (Marx - "Critique of the
Gotha-programme" - 1875. Our translation)
<p>It is on the contrary the Lassallean tradition (also partially used
by Kautsky and social-democracy) that insists, while being wrongly assimilated
to Marx's position, insists on the eternal necessity of the state, on its
conquest, on the divine reign of democracy and therefore of the bourgeoisie:
<p>"Besides, the whole programme is through and through infected by the
servile belief of the lassallean sect in the state, or, which isn't any
better, by the belief in the democratic miracle; or indeed, it is a compromise
between these two kinds of faith or miracle, equally remote from socialism".
(Marx - "Critique of the Gotha-programme" - 1875. Our translation)
<p>So the polemic separating "Marxists" from "anarchists" within the I.W.A.
is not to know whether or not we must destroy the state (at this period
both currents agreed about the destructive tasks of the revolution) but
it is to know if, once the bourgeois state having been destroyed, if a
society without classes and without state could immediately and automatically
emerge. The essential difference between the Bakuninist current (9) and
Marx's positions is not the fight to death against the state, nor even
the question of organization (reformists have always reproached Lenin with
taking up Bakunin's position on the party: dictatorship of the party of
anarchy!) but the essential comprehension of the period of transition,
of this phase when the proletariat, organised as a ruling class which means
as a state, imposes by the force of arms the destruction of value, the
destruction of classes which means also its own negation as "state". This
is why Marx always said about the workers' state that it was a semi-state,
a state in process of extinction.
<p>"It would be advisable to abandon all this gossip about the state, particularly
after the Commune which wasn't really a state in the true sense of the
word. Anarchists already talked enough about their popular state, though
Marx' pamphlet against Proudhon and then also the Manifesto clearly state
that with the instauration of a socialist social regime, the state dissolves
itself and disappears. The state being only a temporary institution that
we are forced to use in our struggle, in the revolution to repress by force
its enemies, it is therefore perfectly absurd to talk about a free and
popular state: as long as the proletariat still needs the state, it is
not for the sake of freedom but to repress its enemies. And when it becomes
possible to talk about freedom, the state ceases to exist as such. So we
propose to replace everywhere the word "state" by the excellent old German
word "Gemeinwesen" corresponding to the French word "commune"." (Engels
- Letter to Bebel - 1875. Our translation))
<p>So Marx's position is clearly against the state.
<p>"The abolition of the state makes sense to communists only as the necessary
result of the suppression of classes the disappearance of which automatically
implies the disappearance of the need for an organized power by one class
for the oppression of another class." (Marx - La Nouvelle Gazette Rhenane
- 1850. Our translation)
<p>The very affirmation of the dictatorship of the proletariat as "transition
towards the abolition of all classes" (cf. letter to Weydemeyer - 1852)
implies the understanding of the necessity of revolutionary terrorism:
<p>"The massacres without any results since the days of June and October,
the dull feast of expiation since February and March, the cannibalism of
counter-revolution itself will convince the people that in order to shorten,
to simplify and to concentrate the murderous death agony of the old society,
there is only one way: revolutionary terrorism". (Marx - La Nouvelle Gazette
Rhenane - 1850. Our translation)
<p>And it was in this same perspective that Marx strongly criticized the
Commune for not having taken the initiative in the struggle, for not having
carried out terrorist acts aimed at saving workers' lives even if this
entailed the killing of some generals and priests.
<p>"Still the shooting of prisoners was suspended for a time. Hardly however,
had Thiers and his decembrist generals become aware that the communal decree
of reprisals was only an empty threat, that even their spies caught in
Paris under the disguise of National Guards, that even the sergents de
ville, taken with incendiary strolls upon them, were spared, then the wholesale
shooting of prisoners was resumed and carried on uninterruptedly to the
end." (Marx - The civil war in France - 1871)
<p>And if Marx' positions on this question is relatively well known, their
connection with the destruction of all alienation/extraenisation (4) is
often hidden. Indeed, the bourgeoisie, except for its pacifist sheep, in
its fright recognizes itself that Marx' positions involve a violent revolution
(didn't it call Marx the "red terror doctor"!), involve a terrorist and
then anti-democratic proletarian dictatorship, understood as being the
force destroying the extraenisation of men, the force destroying wage-slavery
and therefore labour. Even the bourgeois "Marxist" currents - Stalinists,
Trotskyists - maintain this violent and dictatorial aspect. What fundamentally
differentiates them from Marx' positions is not their anti-violence or
their anti-terrorism, but the fact that this violence, this terror is directed
against the revolutionary proletariat and not against the counter-revolutionary
bourgeoisie. In front of these pseudo-Marxist rabbles, we do not discuss
about the opportunity of the use of violence; against them, because they
defend wage-slavery, we turn our arms. The problem is not to know whether
one should use terror, but to know against who to direct our class violence
so as to impose our class dictatorship. What decides of the class nature
of violence is the ultimate goal terror is serving, are the historical
class interests terror is defending. Any other debate immediately falls
back into metaphysics, into philosophy,... putting the question of "violence",
"terror", "the state" in itself, exterior to class struggle, a method Engels
already demolished a long time ago in his Anti-During.
<p>The really important thing for us is to replace back into the centre
of the whole Marxist comprehension the essential question of the workers'
struggle for the abolition of wage-labour and consequently of all labour.
It is to impose its revolutionary claim "the abolition of wage-labour"
(Marx) that the proletariat fights and will be victorious. It is Marx more
than anyone else who has put forward this essential question of the abolition
of wage- labour, who's defended the first our central watchword: "Death
to work, long live communism!".
<p>"We must not only attack private property as a "state of things" but
attack it as activity, as labour if we really want to strike it a deadly
blow. One of the most important mistakes is to talk about social, human,
free labour, to talk about labour without private property. Labour - by
essence - is not free, non-human, anti-social activity conditioned by private
property and creating it in its turn. The abolition of private property
will only become reality if it is conceived as the abolition of labour."
(Marx - Critique of the National Economy - 1845. Our translation)
<p>The proletarian struggle against capital can only be conceived as a
struggle against wage-labour (the form labour is taking under capitalism,
which means alienated, non-human activity) implying the abolition of all
labour.
<p>"In his labour the worker does not affirm himself, he denies himself;
he does not feel at ease, he feels unhappy; he does not spread out a free
physical and intellectual activity, but he mortifies his body and ruins
his spirit. The problem is not to set labour free, but to suppress it!"
(Marx - The German Ideology - 1845. Our translation)
<p>Still many other questions could be subject of a reaffirmation of the
fundamental positions of Marx, settling radically with what is being said
of his positions (what is being said by the class enemy), with what is
generally being designated by the term "Marxism". We insisted many times
already on the fact that the whole vocabulary expressing the communist
project, the revolutionary programme, has been completely plundered, opposing
it now to its original meaning, to the meaning it had clearly at the origins
of the workers' movement. If in Marx' time the quality of communist referred
immediately to an irreducible opposition to the bourgeois state, today,
for most proletarians the same word refers to the sad reality of wage-slavery
in Eastern countries, in China or in Cuba or still the sinister grimaces
of Marchais the clown.
<p>In front of these deformations there can be no question of capitulating,
of leaving these expressions full of history to the enemy by reinventing
all these concepts, by reinventing a new "proletarian" language (that the
bourgeoisie would soon recuperate also). To the contrary, it's important
to give back to these words their original meaning, to recall to the collective
memory of our class the fundamental experiences that gave real life to
these expressions; it is essential to make the bourgeoisie tremble again
just by the mere evocation of the "spectre of communism". The same goes
for the term "Marxist" generalized by Engels after Marx' death, favouring
this way the stupid cult of the "brilliant personality" to the detriment
of the appropriation of the programme. Insofar as the term "Marxist" has
the same meaning as the word "communist", we totally claim ourselves of
this Marxism, of revolutionary communism, knowing that we must always insist
more and more on the anonymous and impersonal character of our programme.
<p>"The revolution will reveal itself terrible but anonymous." (Fantomes
a la caryle - Il Programma Communista - 1953.)
<p>This way Marx' sentence finds its fully Marxist comprehension: "The
only thing I know is that me, I'm not Marxist!" (Marx) It is only from
within the communist movement that we can understand why Marx was not Marxist.
Here no more than anywhere else, the question is not to "go beyond" or
to reject Marxists; what matters is to reaffirm the invariance of the subversion,
the invariance of communism and therefore of Marxism as violent negation
of the established order.
<p>"In all these writings, I never qualify myself as a social-democrat
but as a communist. To Marx as to myself it is absolutely impossible to
use such an elastic expression to designate our own conception". (Engels
- Preface to the pamphlet of Volksstaat off 1871-75. Our translation)
<p>"You, you flatter in the most vulgar way the national feelings and the
corporative prejudices of the German craftsmen, which, of course, is much
more popular. In the same way the democrats made a sacred formula of the
word "people", you, you are making a sacred formula of the word "proletariat".
Just like the democrats you are substituting revolutionary phraseology
to the revolutionary development". (Marx - Minutes of the Central Council
of London - 1850. Our translation)

<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">Notes</font></u></h3>
1. In this sense all the varieties of leftism who pretend to realise "the
democratic bourgeois tasks", "the socialization of the economy", "the nationalizations",...
are behind on the movement of capital itself. Capital, through its own
movement has realised the most radical reformist programmes, from the programmes
of Trotskyists to the most daring reveries of self-management (cf Castoriadis,
Gramsci, to Ratgeb/Vaneigem). So leftism is not only reactionary in relation
to communism, but more so, it is retrograde in relation to the movement
of value, to the movement of capital!
<p>2. On this question we refer our readers to the text "Contribution to
the so-called question of the party" published in Communism No 2.
<p>3. Some texts as fundamental as "The Jewish question", "The German Ideology",
"The thesis on Feuerbach", "The Grundrisse", "The sixth chapter",... had
to wait decades before being published and even then they were published
only partially or were completely distorted. Revolutionaries had to wait
for the important work of integral republication of the masterworks of
Marx by Riazanov to see the appearance of those essential texts (work that
gave Riazanov the "privilege" of disappearing in the thirties, eliminated
by Staline). For example the "Grundrisse", that had to wait until 1939
to be published is German, revealed in an irrefutable way that the masterwork
of Marx constitutes an indissociable totality, while all Marxologues of
yesterday and today work desperately hard to dislocate it, to cut it up,
to oppose one part of it against another.
<p>4. On this question we refer our readers to the text which replaces
the Marxist problematic of alienation back to the centre of the revolutionary
programme: "From the alienation of man to the human community" that appeared
is our French-language review "Le Communiste" (No 14) and that we hope
to publish soon in Communism.
<p>5. On this essential question of method, we refer our readers to our
text (so far only available in French) "Critical notes on dialectical materialism"
published in "Le Communiste" No 13.
<p>6. The numerous works published or republished and that pretend representing
the life and work of Karl Marx are mostly popularizations, distortions,
falsifications and even plagiarisms for the sake of one or another bourgeois
current. However, we would like to mention the following books that distinguish
themselves from the mainstream of these bourgeois ideological productions:
<br>- "Karl Marx" by Karl Korsh
<br>- "Marx and Engels" by D. Riazanov
<br>- "Karl Marx" an essay of intellectual biography by Maximilien Rubel
<br>- "Karl Marx - the history of his life" by Franz Mehring. But nothing
can compare with the unwearying study of the complete works of Marx and
Engels of such intrinsic value that no "summary", no "synthesis" can possibly
restore the totality of the Marxist conception of this world. We therefore
stress the very importance of the regular militant study of the works of
Marx, each day more operational, more alive in our struggle against capital.
<p>7. "In the same way, Marx and Engels magnificently synthetised the communist
programme in the famous Manifesto of l848, which, even if it had been ordered
by a formal "party" - the Communist League - has a validity, a contents
that bypasses the narrow framework of this little group of communist militants
to such extend that today nobody would ever think of restricting the universal
significance of he Manifesto to the simple programme of the League. The
Manifesto is a direct achievement of the party in its large historical
acceptation." Cited from "Contribution to the so-called question of the
party" - Communism No 2.
<p>8. Of course, both terms of this contradiction class non-class should
not be conceived as pure abstractions excluding one another automatically,
but as a tendential movement of confrontation until victory - solution
of the contradiction through the affirmation of the revolutionary pole
- i.e. affirmation of the revolutionary cllass as the dominant class and
negation of the proletariat - negation of the negation.
<p>9. Bakunin and his friends in the I.W.A. (James Guillaume,...) do not
have anything to do with the "anarchists" we know today in Europe. From
the French Anarchist Federation (i.e. French freemasonry) to the governmental
CNT in Spain: from the "anarchist" Babar in Belgium supporting the papal
trade-union Solidarnosc to the green pacifists everywhere, all this libertarian
shit is as remote from Bakunin as Stalinist Marxist-leninists are from
Marx. If Bakunin developed wrong positions especially as far as the dictatorship
of the proletariat is concerned, this was undeniably from the proletarian
and revolutionary point of view, while today his many 'grandsons' flounder
openly in counter-revolution.
<blockquote><font face="Comic Sans MS">"And now as to myself, no credit
is due to me for discovering the existence of classes in modern society
or struggles between them. Long before me bourgeois historians had described
the historical development of this class struggle and bourgeois economists
the economic anatomy of the classes. What I did was to prove that 1) the
existence of classes is only bound up with particular historical phases
in the development of production 2) that the class struggle necessarily
leads to the dictatorship of the proletariat 3) that the dictatorship itself
only constitutes the transition to the abolition of all classes and to
a classless society..." (Marx)</font></blockquote>

After the march for equality end against racism of 1983, after the motorcycles
of "Convergence" that left from five French cities to meet at the carnival-parade
gathering more than 30.000 people in Paris on Dec.1st, 1984, now the spotlights
zoom on "S.O.S. Racism" and on a new musical happening at the Concorde.
Every year it's the same bullshit with a different topping.
<p>The people who organized last year's march could rely from the very
beginning on the help and the support of the French State, of the democrats,
of humanist and religious associations, of the Trotskyist Communist Revolutionary
League as well as still other nationalists. They pretend that they don't
act with a precise political goal, but simply "want to show what happens
in the social ghettos, how people from all horizons live there and express
their hopes". The slogans of the march were: "For a multicultural France",
"Together for equality", "Neither rejections nor assimilation, for a new
citizenship".
<p>As for "S.O.S. Racism" with the badge "Touche pas a mon pote", they
hold on to a more simple discourse, they claim to be against all racism
and their actions are limited to press-conferences, investigations and
counter- investigations, legal proceedings and other mobilisations of sensibilization.
<p>All these initiatives are part of the sinister attacks capital leads
against our class.
<p>Since the Socialist Party was democratically elected into government
in 1981, all workers have "benefited" from governmental action: increase
of unemployment (of which no single bourgeois no longer contests the need),
expulsion of all "irregular" immigrants, reinforcement of the democratic
forces of law and order (new crusade of Pierre Joxe - the French home secretary
-, to modernize the repressive system), reestructurations (=intensifying
exploitation) without forgetting the action of Badinter - the minister
of justice - who grants particular care (as witnessed by the mutinies in
prisons) to the black sheeps of socialist France.
<p>Today, with "S.O.S. Racism" as yesterday with "Convergence", the State
receives a new support to actively repress the proletarian movement, particularly
concerning the explosive sector of young immigrants.
<p>In France it was mainly during the summer of 1981 that those young proletarians
of the suburbs of Lyon and Marseille, rebelled against the boredom and
the misery of their lives. It was not an isolated rebellion: at the same
time, the Brixton riots, where whites and blacks, men and women, young
and old were united to fight the cops and to burn down and ransack, followed
within a few months by new rebellions in twelve other English cities, showed
that this struggle is the struggle of all exploited.
<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">S.O.S. Capitalism</font></u></h2>
To prevent the violent assertion of the community of interest that unites
all the workers of the world against the bourgeoisie, capital revives racism,
systematically imposes it on all relations between citizens, as one of
the means to oppose workers one against the other, to atomize them.
<p>The bourgeoisie has not invented racism, it is the product of the division
of society in classes. Capital, in its wild race for profit, always gives
birth to categorial differences between workers, the most important being
the one between national workers and immigrants. By exploiting those differences
the bourgeoisie develops and generalizes the racist ideology and turns
it into a material force of its preservation: racism permits to avoid the
polarisation of society into two antagonistic classes.
<p>But the indispensable complement to racism is anti-racism. Anti-racist
wants to maintain a society where harmony reigns between all citizens who,
despite their differences of culture and colour, should be able to benefit
from the same rights. But what rights do workers have?
<p>Yesterday, when the immigrant was valorizing capital, was sweating value,
he represented no problem to society; on the contrary, society used to
welcome immigrants with open arms (which is a formula, because when it
wasn't hunger that forced them to travel thousands of miles to find work,
it was directly the State who, under the threat of guns forced them to
exile!).
<p>But today, it's the crisis, there are too many proletarians so it has
become necessary to eliminate part of them: the bourgeoisie "discovers"
it has an "immigration problem". And our anti-racists shout: "Beware, no
racism! Equal rights for all!".
<p>As long as proletarians behave as honest and responsible citizens, if
they accept to participate to the national effort to save the economy,
if they accept to participate to the elections, to the unions if they accept
everything, including loss of jobs, evictions and even the sacrifice of
their lives in always more deadly extermination wars, then they can benefit
from all imaginable rights (which in certain countries are duties!): vote,
self-expression, associations,...
<p>But if workers, and no matter what colour they are, don't respect capitalist
logic (or if their mere presence hinders this logic), if they say no to
sacrifices, shit to national economy, if they struggle against wage decreases,
if they organize themselves against expulsions and bullying, then immediately,
in the name of these same rights and of democracy, in the name of civilisation,
a flood of repression pounces upon them. These proletarians, who break
social peace and organize themselves against society to obtain by force
the satisfaction of their needs, are nothing but provocateurs, rioters,
enemies of democracy!
<p>By claiming "equal rights for all", anti-racists do nothing else but
submitting proletarians a little more to the "laws of French people". These
laws regulate as everywhere else, the relationship between buyers and sellers
of goods, they do nothing else but submitting the workers to the necessity
to get rid of the surplus of this commodity, labour power, when it exceeds
the needs of valorization of capital. To claim "equal rights for all" means
submitting the workers to the legal repression by the State, to all anti-workers
measures,... that are very democratically decided by the elected parliament
of the nation! Need we recall the "legalisation of all immigrant workers
without working permits" that allowed the French State, supported by all
leftists, to expulse ten of thousands of immigrant workers!!! Those are
the kind of perspectives anti-racists propose.
<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">Class solidarity</font></u></h2>
Our struggle has nothing to do with the right of being legally exploited
and repressed. The rights are nothing else but the legitimation of bourgeois
democratic terror. Let's not be fooled by their speeches about "solidarity"
between French and immigrants, by their flatteries about good immigrants
who "have contributed to the wealth of the country". That solidarity is
social peace, it means the reinforcement of individual submission to capital
for all proletarians.
<p>To Impede wage decreases, lay-offs, police repression, expulsions, evictions,
fascist aggressions, we don't need neither pity nor charity, but our own
class force organized beyond all divisions.
<p>Organizations such as "S.O.S. Racism" only prepare the denunciation
and isolation of combative workers who, to defend themselves against expulsions,
beatings,... use direct action against all the forces of law and order:
police, fascists, unions,... without justifying themselves as good citizens
would. Only the struggle on the ground of class war against bourgeois legality
represents the common interest of all workers.
<p>The repression of part of the workers is a defeat for the whole working
class: against the anti-racist priests, we must organize against all sacrifices,
towards active solidarity with all the struggling proletarians!!

<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">Introduction</font></u></h2>
In this issue of our english-language review "Communism" we're starting
a new heading "Workers' Memory" - just like we've been republishing for
several years already in our French and Spanish reviews other important
and often old texts from the workers' movement that today are difficult
to find. We consider this to be an essential part of our struggle to revitalise
the communist movement. Our aim is not to simply republish something that
once existed - we are not curators of some "proletarian" museum - nor to
try to proove that we are the rightfull heirs of a communist current of
the past; on the contrary, often our criticism of our predecessors' activities
will be very severe in view of the many insufficiencies, the many concessions
to social-democracy that often persisted.
<p>The only school we learn at, is history; i.e. not the different representations
of history that society may have produced, but the history made and lived
by our class and by the exploited classes from the past - the history of
their heroic, vital but also limited struggles that the proletariat will
be finally capable of bringing to their ultimate term: communism.
<p>Communism for us isn't a condition that has to be created, nor an ideal
to which reality should conform. We call communism the real movement of
abolition of the present situation. The conditions of this movement result
from the premises that already exist in today's society.
<p>This means that today's proletarian struggles are directly linked, in
their very substance, in their determinations, to the struggles our class
waged throughout the past. Moreso, one of the premises of today's struggle
is the struggle of the past: it is only because of today's struggles that
the proletariat can "exhume" the many experiences - of incommensurate value
- of the elder generations of proletarian  militants; and it is only owing
to these experiences that today we can go beyond the limits that locked
up and defeated the movement yesterday. Our class struggles (and we refuse
to mystify that class knowing how it were real men and women who fought
to give strength, to give body to our class!) made possible for all the
fundamental determinations of the communist movement to become clear: it
is through the sweat and blood of millions of anonymous militant workers
that our class experienced how we got defeated each time we abandoned our
autonomy to engage in compromises, in policies, in fronts with our class
enemy; how we got defeated each time we submitted ourselves to the forces
of democracy and nationalism!
<p>In order to "exhume" the revolutionary struggles of the past, it is
important not to confound or identify the very essence of these struggles,
their intrinsic subversive character (antagonistic to capital) with the
different formalisations that were produced by this movement in an attempt
to centralise it, to built it up into a force capable of acting organically
as a whole so as to kill the capitalist monster. The history of the revolutionary
uprisings of our class throughout the years 1917-1923 is not just the history
of the Third International!
<p>We musn't neglect the many efforts made by the bourgeoisie to ignore,
to falsify the history of society by concealing all signs of communist
struggles. It is only normal that the bourgeoisie falsifies and hides the
historical process where the proletariat acts as an autonomous force of
the destruction of capital: this way the bourgeoisie expresses the terror
it feels when it's getting confronted once more with the terrible forces
created by its own domination and by its system of misery. The lies and
filth poured on our struggles are not just the result of the bourgeoisie's
machiavellian conspiracy against the communist movement, but first of all
they are the result of the class interests of the bourgeoisie that make
it <u>incapable</u> to see or understand a reality that is going beyond
its proper system of commodity-production, that is antagonistic to its
proper logic of profit and value.
<p>Lies and filth on the miners' strike; lies and filth on the proletarian
struggles in South-Africa; lies and filth on struggles in Perou, in Argentina,...
In the same way all informations on struggles from the past are systematically
deformed, hidden, falsified! Deformed the positions of the KAPD, hidden
the revolutionary struggles of our class in Patagonia, falsified fundamental
texts by Marx, Engels and other revolutionaries... not to mention the documents
that remain locked up in Moscow until... the year 2000, by what time the
Kremlin promises to publish the complete works by Marx and Engels!
<p>This way the communist movement gets travestied as a movement for democracy,
for peace, for progress! Never will the bourgeois show how communism <u>destroys
democracy, destroys progress, destroys frontiers</u> while building up
its own community according to its proper needs - today's only need being
to fight for the destruction of what is destroying us! -
<p>Republishing texts, criticizing struggles from the past like we start
doing here in this new heading, is part of this fight.

<font face="Comic Sans MS">oOo</font></h2></center>
Little is known, in Britain itself but even more so on the continent, about
the British left. As a proof for this stands the fact that the british
left is almost always identified with the "Workers' Dreadnought" (1) and
that the latter is often identified with Sylvia Pankhurst, who, undubitably,
took a prominent part in its activities. Even so, we hardly know anything
about the real activities and positions of neither the "Workers' Dreadnought"
nor Sylvia Pankhurst.
<p>In this article, as a first contribution, we'll try to outline the main
landmarks in the development of the Pankhurst group, followed by the reprint
of "Communist Party: Provisional Resolutions towards a Programme" published
in the 3rd of July, 1920 issue of the ''Workers' Dreadnought".
<p>Sylvia Pankhurst if often remembered for her part in the campaign for
Universal Suffrage. Her group, uptill 1917, was called "The Workers' Suffrage
Federation" which published a paper: the "Women's Dreadnought". This group
stemmed from radical feminism. Under the influence of the deepening sufferings
caused by the war and of the struggles that responded to this, Pankhurst
soon became interested in the "social" question and the group started participating
in different strike movements.
<p>It was only at its annual conference in May 1917 that the Workers' Suffrage
Federation decided to change the name of its newspaper to the "Workers'
Dreadnought". But even so, in spite of this new name and in spite of the
adoption by the conference of a programme referring more explicitly to
the cause of "socialism", the group remains clearly on social-democratic
and pacifist positions: "Peace! Socialism! Votes for all! Stop the Hideous
slaughter by ending war! Down with profiteering! Secure food and necessaries
for all! Not votes for some but Adult Suffrage! Down with the House of
Lords!"
<p>At this stage the "Workers' Dreadnought" is merely a radical appendix
of the left fraction of the bourgeoisie: in an editorial on the Labour
Party, the W.D. calls upon this party to become "an out-and-out Socialist
Party, with a vigorous policy of attack on the present system..."
<p>It'll be only later on, mainly through the radicalization of events
in Russia, in Germany and likewise in most other countries (2) and because
of the W.D.'s capacities to remain attentive to the real developments of
the proletarian struggle, that the W.D. manages to turn its back to its
own past, to the policy of reform of the capitalist world and move from
<u>a
critical</u> point of view on the question of parliament and the Labour
Party, to a <u>subversive position on these issues</u>. Leftists prefer
to obscure this evolution and its importance for the revolutionary movement
(in Britain, but also internationally); they praise Pankhurst only as a
reformer, refusing to admit how she <u>broke</u> with her original feminist
and reformist engagement, adopting a line of principled struggle against
reform and reformists.
<p>We can witness the first weak signs of this evolution from 1918 onward.
In an editorial of January, 26th 1918 Sylvia Pankhurst, who had been one
of the very first in Britain to hail the events in Russia, defends the
Soviet system and supports the dissolution of the Constituent Assembly
by the Bolsheviks (3). She argues that the parliamentary system would be
unable to cope with the task of establishing socialism, and that the Soviet
system is far more democratic than any parliament. This very ambiguous
position on the role of parliament and on the real meaning and function
of democracy (and the non-understanding of communism as being the negation
of democracy) continues to coexist with the "Votes for all" slogan on the
front page of the paper untill July 1918 when "Socialism Internationalism,
Votes for all!" was dropped and replaced by "For International Socialism"
and when at the same time the annual conference voted to change the name
of the organization to "Workers' Socialist Federation" (W.So.F.).
<p>The next important step was made in an article of November, 2nd 1918
on the Labour Party and parliament. Sylvia Pankhurst states in a much more
radical tone that "the expected general election interests us only so far
as it can be made a sounding board for the policy of replacing capitalism
by socialism and parliament by the workers' councils" and as a matter of
fact in December of the same year, Pankhurst turns down the offer of a
parliamentary candidature for the Hallam division of Sheffield and campaigned
instead for the abolition of capitalist parliaments and the establishment
of councils of workers' delegates. From now on the "Workers' Dreadnought"
will start taking a clear and definite stand on parliament, on parliamentarism
as well as on the Labour Party, positions on which it will find itself
soon in contradiction with Lenin and the Third Communist International.
<u>This,
in return, will force the "Workers' Dreadnought" to take more and more
its responsibilities in view of the development of the communist movement,
and the subsequent tasks that devolve upon its militants.</u> As a matter
of fact, untill then, one of the main characteristics of the Pankhurst
Group was that the group based itself on its own direct experience, without
really trying to analyse more thoroughly the very foundations of the communist
movement (nor of capitalist society), and without really trying to link
up with other expressions of the communist movement, from the past as well
as from other origins or countries (4); untill then the W.So.F. had mainly
been a simple group of activists, correspondents, readers,... around a
newspaper, this paper being a mere <u>reflection</u> of the workers struggles
of that time.
<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">Towards a united party?</font></u></h2>
On the 14th of June 1919 the W.So.F. holds its annual conference. On recommendation
of a delegate from the CI (founded a few months earlier) the group adopts
the title of "Communist Party" and its Executive Committee is instructed
to take steps towards linking up with other communist groups in Britain.
The new communist party declares itself in favour of the power of workers
councils and of the CI; against parliament and against the Second International.
A few weeks later, the newly founded party decides NOT to call itself "Communist
Party" for the moment so as not to prejudice the unity negotiations with
other groups: the old name W.So.F. is restored: "As instructed by the Annual
Conference at Whitsuntide, the National Executive Committee has entered
into negotiations with other organisations for the formation of a united
Communist Party. The Committee recommends that the use of the name Communist
Party adopted at the W.So.F. Annual Conference be delayed during the process
of these negotiations, in order that the new united party, which is hoped
will eventuate, may adopt the title Communist Party as its own."
<p>These negotiations will continue for one year. During this year the
W.D. gives a more international dimension to its debates and Pankhurst's
activities themselves got more and more determined by as well the need
for clarification of her own programmatical positions and at the same time
the need for an international centre of struggle: this all led up to her
moving closer to the left fractions of the communist movement.
<p>Pankhurst assisted the Conference of the Italian Socialist Party. In
W.D. of November, 8th 1919 we find a report on the Congress of the Italian
SP, which mentions the Abstentionist Fraction, followed by a discussion
with Bordiga (the official spokesman of the Italian Abstentionist Fraction)
regarding his position on the relationship between Party and Soviets. Against
Bordiga, who underlines the importance of the party as a safeguard of the
positions and historical interests of the proletariat, the W.D. takes a
more "educationist" stand in favour of workers learning through the soviet
experience. We haven't got this article in our possession, so we can't
really criticize it: nevertheless we want to stress the reactionary illusion
that lays behind all "educationist" theories. This theory, according to
which communists should "educate" workers i.e. make them see and understand
their class situation and consequently the need for communism, is just
another variety of the democratic theory of councilism: the conception
of the conquest of consciousness of a large majority of workers (through
councils) as a determinant condition for revolution. Historically this
theory has always served to never understand a revolutionary situation
nor the particular tasks that derive from such situation, has always served
to... wait, to delay,... to stop the movement pretending that the masses
are not ready yet for revolution, that the masses won't understand,...
in fact, the REFUSAL of violent struggle, the REFUSAL of armed insurrection,
the REFUSAL of a communist revolution and the triumph of democracy! As
far as the "Italian" position on the question of the party is concerned,
we just want to mention that Bordiga, as one of the most reputable spokesmen
of the Italian left, SUBMITTED his action, somewhat against his own formal
positions on the question of the party, but for the sake of (formal!) discipline,
to the orientations of the Third International.
<p>Straight after having assisted to this conference, Pankhurst travelled
to Berlin to attend the meeting that set up the West European Secretariat
of the Comintern (February 1920); she then travelled to Amsterdam for the
first meeting of the West European Sub-bureau of the Third Communist International.
This sub-bureau played a most important role in the struggle of the left
fractions against the social-democratic positions that to a large extend
characterised the Third International from the very beginning and that
were to draw it irresistibly towards the reformist quicksands and to make
it an instrument, from the 2nd Congress onward, in the hands of counter-revolution
(5).
The Amsterdam Conference of the bureau committed those present to "no compromise
with the bourgeoisie or social patriotic parties, with parties of the Second
International or with agents of capital within the labour movement." On
Pankhurst's initiative the Bureau voted a resolution that recommended the
preparation of the proletariat to a general strike in case a revolution
should come about in one country. The bureau declared itself against working
in parliament or trade-unions. Just before its closing down, the bureau
issued a statement against affiliation to the Labour Party. It was for
all these reasons that Moscow disavowed the Amsterdam bureau it had set
up six months earlier in an attempt to break russian isolation by preparing
a conference of West European communist parties. The suppression of the
bureau was announced on May, 15th 1920. Its activities were transferred
to Berlin, where the KPD was powerful enough to control the orientations
of the bureau.
<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">What kind of unity?</font></u></h2>
During the unity-negotiations, most of the socialist groups of Britain
declared themselves in favour of the overthrow of capitalism and the establishment
of communism, the dictatorship of the proletariat, the soviet system and
affiliation to the Third International. But as soon as these general principles
require a more concrete application, i.e. when it comes down to refusing
parliamentary action and affiliation to the Labour Party, these points
prove to be real obstacles to communist unity in Britain. As we have witnessed
so often, the more radical groups defending the interests of capital, agree
to nearly everything insofar it allows them not to change the very basis
of this system.
<p>If the South Wales Socialist Society agreed with the W.So.F. on the
matter of parliament and affiliation to the Labour Party, the other two
main participants to the unity talks, the Socialist Labour Party and even
more so the British Socialist Party, by far the most important group, rejected
the W.So.F.'s programme, favouring parliamentary action and, as far as
the British Socialist Party was concerned, affiliation to the Labour Party.
<p>On June, 26th of the same year, the W.D. announces the foundation of
the Communist Party around the W.So.F.'s programme, i.e. against parliamentarism
and against affiliation to the Labour Party. What had happened is that
Pankhurst preferred to initiate the formation of a communist party, be
it a small one, on a principles basis (6) rather than sacrificing these
principles for the sake of the ephemeral immediat succes brought by the
foundation of a much larger, but unprincipled and in fact submitted to
capital's needs, "communist" party. Already on February, 21st 1920 in an
article on the problems of regroupment in Britain "Towards a Communist
Party" Pankhurst stated that she was ready to go ahead to form a "left-wing"
communist party if no principled regroupment with other parties could take
place! Now, nevertheless, apart from the W.So.F. seven other small communist
groups supported the formation of the new Communist Party, that declared
itself the British Section of the Third International (BSTI) at a conference
in London on June, 19th 1920.
<p>So the "Workers' Dreadnought" now became the "organ of the Communist
Party" and started publishing the Party's provisional programme. It are
these provisional resolutions that we're publishing. It is obvious to us
that, except from the position on parliament and affiliation to the Labour
Party, that the "Workers' Dreadnought" as far as all other questions are
concerned (workers' democracy, councils, nationalizations, unions, judges
in communist courts (!)) remains locked up in a social-democratic vision
of the communist movement. On other occasions we will criticise these positions;
here we just want to show how in spite of these many social-democratic
positions, that to a large extend reflect the still dominant influence
at that time of social-democracy on important fractions of the proletariat,
namely in Britain, that the "Workers' Dreadnought" nevertheless moved dynamically
towards a more and more internationalist practice of rupture with these
forces of conservation of the capitalist system. This evolution of the
"Workers' Dreadnought" itself is a clear disavowal of its own pretention
as communists to be the "licensed" holder of "the knowledge", "the consciousness",
"the communist ideology or science" without which the proletariat, the
real movement could not get anywhere!!!
<p>Five weeks later, on the first of August, 1920, the British Socialist
Party, together with part of the Socialist Labour Party formed the Communist
Party of Great Britain (already in the denomination itself we can distinguish
Pankhurst's internationalist orientation from the nationalist position
of the official communist party, the CPGB): they adopted a programme of
affiliation to Labour and of parliamentary action.
<p>At this same time, the Comintern declared itself openly in favour of
tactical "devices" always more clearly in opposition to the general principles
of communism. In April, 1920 Lenin had completed his pamphlet "Left-wing
communism, an infantile disorder" (as a preparatory text for the second
Congress) that laid down the tactics of affiliation and parliamentarism
as the right policies for british communists to bring about the revolution.
In his pamphlet, Lenin tried to justify and explain, very dialecticaly,
how it is right for the proletariat to vote into government its future
butchers, the british Noske! Pankhurst's position was that "as social-patriotic
organisations of other countries, the Labour Party will inevitably come
to power through the natural course of development of society. The task
of communists is to organise the forces that will overthrow the social-patriots,
and we musn't delay this action in our country, nor hesitate. We musn't
waste our energy by increasing the strength of the Labour Party: its rise
to power is inevitable. We have to use our forces to create a communist
movement that will defeat this party. The Labour party will soon be forming
a government. The revolutionary opposition must make ready to attack it."
(Quoted from Lenin's "Left-wing Communism").
<p>Pankhurst went to Moscow to defend the communist positions at the second
Congress of the C.I. (July/August 1920). She didn't stand alone: delegates
from different other countries also defended the same programme of intransigent
struggle against capital. We know the left positions got defeated at this
congress: to the contrary, the infamous 21 conditions that, amongst other
things enjoined trade-union work and parliamentary activity as conditions
for membership of the C.I. were adopted (7).
<p>Just like left groups in other countries, the CP (BSTI) now faced a
choice: maintaining its communist principles at the risk of returning to
a state of relative isolation, or abandoning these principles for the sake
of remaining in the mainstream of the international proletarian movement,
knowing that this movement, and its main formal organ, the Third International,
instead of clearly defining and fighting the class enemy, started to compromise,
to negotiate, to trade,... with it. In the face of the prestige of Lenin,
of the Third International and also because in the end the "Workers' Dreadnought"
group surely reckoned that all thing considered, that the <u>points of
agreement between itself and the Third International, that the positive
positions of the C.I. prevailed over the points of disagreement</u> - and
after much internal acrimony (1/3 of its members resigned!) - the CP (BSTI)
at the Leeds Unity Convention on January 1921 decided to abandon its principles
on parliamentarism and on the question of affiliation, and to enter the
CPGB. On January, 22nd the "Workers' Dreadnought" announces that is is
no longer the "organ of the Communist Party" now that the united CP has
been formed. Pankhurst, who at that time was in jail on a charge of sedition,
did not take part in these final unity negotiations: from prison she recommended
that the CP (BSTI) enter the CPGB as an opposition group. And as a matter
of fact, the "Dreadnought" declared itself to be an independant organ,
giving an independant support to the Party from a left wing point of view.
Released from prison in May 1921, Pankhurst apparently pursued this struggle
without compromises, since she got expelled from the party only four months
later (on September 1921) following her repeated forthright condemnations
of CPGB and Comintern policies. But starting from then, the "Workers' Dreadnought"
didn't succeed in maintaining its activities, became less and less influential
to finally disappear in 1924.
<h3>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">Notes</font></u></h3>
1. We know of at least one other group (from Glasgow) that during this
same period took up positions (in its papers "The Spur" 1914-1921 and "The
Commune" 1923-1928) close to those of the "Workers' Dreadnought"; this
group sent delegates to the 3rd Congress of the Communist International
in Moscow, where they were contacted by the german left (KAPD).
<p>2. Indeed, it was an international wave of revolutionary action that
was challenging the old world - important class movements took place in
Patagonia, in Mexico, in India, in China, in the Middle East,...
<p>3. We don't know exactly what informations communists in England or
elsewhere got on the events in Russia. The need for the bourgeoisie to
destroy and falsify all historical process where the proletariat acts as
the real subject of history (and no longer as pure object) and the isolation
which confined most revolutionary action to national boundaries (i.e. the
inexistence of <u>an international center</u> of struggle) explain the
ignorance that often prevailed as to what was really happening in Russia
and everywhere else. Often revolutionary action is taken in solidarity
with what is <u>supposed</u> to be happening elsewhere, proletarians referring
in an enthusiastic way to what they want to happen, to what they can see
as a necessity!As far as the Constituent Assembly goes, it seems that the
Bolsheviks only dissolved it in January 1918, after having organised elections
for it (elections after the victorious October insurrection!!!) when this
assembly started organising openly the counter-revolution. Even so, the
Bolsheviks only decided to dissolve this assembly because they were being
forced to by more radical fractions of the proletariat. (On this subject,
see L. Shapiro: "The Bolcheviks and their opposition 1917-1922").
<p>4. This also explains the preponderant influence of Sylvia Pankhurst
on the evolution of the group: she - just like the group - "came" to communism
when communism was strong enough to impose itself, but moved away from
it again as the communist movement got defeated.
<p>5. We cannot analyse in this introduction the very complex process of
degeneration of the CI. The CI, founded <u>very late</u> (the first congress
took place in March, 1919) as an attempt to break the isolation of Soviet
Russia, soon revealed itself to be nothing else but a centre for the defence
of the interests of the russian bourgeois state abroad. This was the result,
not of some betrayal, but in the first place of the many weaknesses - i.e.
the social-democratic orientations that persisted and that had never been
criticized but on a formal basis - that characterized the Third International
from the very start. This situation materialised the weaknesses of the
whole communist movement of that period. If we insist on the revolutionary
contribution of the left fractions (that emerged in most countries: Bulgaria,
Mexico, Italy, Spain, Luxembourg, England, Belgium, United States, India,
South-Africa, Poland, Germany,...) it is precisely because of their efforts
to denounce and clarify <u>the counter-revolutionary nature of the very
fundamentals of social-democracy</u>, of the Second International as an
organ, from its very origins, for the reform of capital. In this introduction
we just mention some of the facts that illustrate the process of degeneration
of the CI.
<p>6. We can draw a parallel here with what happened in France with the
first and ephemeral Communist Party founded in May 1919 by P&eacute;ricat
and Lepetit but that soon disappeared at the end of the same year.
<p>7. It was the Italian left that insisted that another condition be added
to the 20 already existing conditions, which stipulated that no party could
claim membership to the Third International if it didn't accept these conditions!
Pretending fighting this way against centrist and right-wing parties, reality
has shown that these conditions were actually used against the left positions.
As a matter of fact, these conditions stated clearly that to be a communist,
one had to vote, to agree to parliamentary and union activity, to support
"all movements of emancipation in the colonies'',...

<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">Principal aims</font></u></h2>

<h3>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Capitalism to be replaced by communism</font></h3>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Communist Party aims at the complete overthrow
of Capitalism; the abolition of private property; the socialisation of
the land, the means of production and distribution; and the establishment
of Communism, a classless order of free human beings living on terms of
economic and political equality, safeguarded from material want and assured
of ample means of subsistence.</font>
<h3>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Substitution of the Soviets for the parliamentary
system</font></h3>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The abolition of Parliament and of the existing
local governing bodies and the substitution of this form of capitalist
representation and control by a Soviet system of national and local councils.</font>
<h3>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Abolition of wages system</font></h3>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The abolition of wages system, and the establishment
of the right of all human beings to the free satisfaction of their personal
needs from the natural resources of the country.</font>
<h3>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The abolition of social classes</font></h3>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The abolition of social classes and all titles
of rank, the sharing by all able-bodied adults in the necessary labour
to the community.</font>
<h3>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The breaking up of empires</font></h3>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The breaking up of all empires, since these
are instruments of capitalist oppression and exploitation, and to the establishment
of a world federation of communist republics, and the consequent abolition
of all racial and national barriers. Whose over lives and works in a Soviet
republic is entitled to all the rights of citizenship.</font>
<h3>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The workers' revolution and dictatorship</font></h3>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Communist Party recognizes that the capitalists
will not allow themselves to be deposed except by force, and that capitalism
can only be overthrown by workers' revolution. It also believes that the
revolution will be accomplished by industrial mass action, leading to armed
insurrection.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Therefore the Communist Party believes that
the dictatorship of the proletariat must be vigorously applied until the
transition period from Capitalism to Communism has been safely passed and
the counter-revolution completely suppressed.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">The Party aims therefore at the disarming
of the Army, Navy and police force created under capitalism, and the creation
of a workers' Red Army and Navy, and the arming of all trusted workers.
All workers shall be trained to flight in defence of the workers' revolution.
The military instruction of the Red Army shall be accompanied by the teaching
of Communism and class solidarity. Trusted Communists, elected by Soviets,
shall work in conjunction with the Military experts.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">When the transition period is entirely over,
and the world federation of Soviets republics is established, the need
for Red Armies and navies will have disappeared.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">The proletarian dictatorship will not misinterpret
the principle of the freedom of the press into allowing newspapers and
other publications to advocate the return of a state of society that was
based upon class exploitation. With this limitation only, the discussion
of ethical and economic ideals and principles of administration and social
organisation will be unrestricted, and the press will be entirely free.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">The proletarian dictatorship will deprive
of political power all those who attempt to perpetuate or re-introduce
capitalist exploitation, and who refuse to do socially useful work.</font>
<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">Methods</font></u></h2>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The workers must be prepared not merely to "down
tools", but to seize the power of governments, to carry on production,
and to defend their conquests by force. With this end in view, the Party
will organize:</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">a. to seize control of production;</font>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">b. to win the allegiance of the Army and
Navy to the cause of the workers, as opposed to that of the Capitalist
State, in preparation for the revolutionary struggle, and the creation
of a Red Army.</font>
<h3>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Industrial organisation</font></h3>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In the countries of bourgeois democracy and
long-standing Trade Unionism, a tendency is evident towards Trade Union
bureaucracy, which becomes more and more an adjunct and support to the
capitalist system. The Communist Party will therefore stimulate the growth
of the rank and file organization, in order to undermine the influence
of reactionary Trade Union leaders over the rank and file, so that the
masses may learn to act in unison, that they may be ready to set up Soviets,
and to seize control of production in the moments of crisis.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">The old Trade Unionism is already in process
of transformation. In some industries existing organisations are being
adapted towards Sovietism by the force of rank and file effort, in others
new industrial organizations are formed, in others unofficial rank and
file organisms challenge the official institutions. When the revolutionary
seizure of power has been accomplished, this process will be accelerated.
The existing organisations will either be socialised with comparative rapidity
or they will be superseded altogether.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">After the crisis is passed, the existing
unions may be converted for Communist administration, but experience teaches
that in the hour of crisis no official revolutionary action can be expected
from the general body of Trade Unions. The policy of the Communist Party
will therefore be:</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">a. To form a revolutionary Communist group
in every workshop and Trade Union branch.</font>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">b. To promote the organization of unofficial
industrial organizations.</font>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">c. To support all strikes, and to endeavour
to give them a revolutionary trend, exposing the futility of efforts to
secure mere increases of land-workers is an urgent necessity.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">The propagation of Communist ideas amongst
the land-workers is an important part of Communist work.</font>
<h3>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Co-operative workers</font></h3>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Communist Party desires that the Co-operative
employees shall form part of the revolutionary proletariat, and assist
in organizing the industries in which they work. The Co-operative stores
and factories will be socialised like all others.</font>
<h3>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not parliament but the Soviets</font></h3>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Communist Party, believing that instruments
of capitalist organization and domination cannot be used for revolutionary
ends, refrains from participation in Parliament and in the Bourgeois Local
Government system. It will ceaselessly impress upon the workers that their
salvation lies not in the organ of the bourgeois "democracy", but through
the Workers' Soviets.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">The Communist Party refuses all compromise
with Right and Centrist Socialism. The British Labour Party is dominated
by Opportunist Reformists, Social Patriots, and Trade Union Bureaucrats,
who have already allied themselves with capitalism against the workers'
revolution at home and abroad. The construction and constitution of the
British Labour Party is such that the working masses cannot express themselves
through it. It is affiliated and will remain affiliated to the Second International,
so long as that so-called International shall exist.</font>
<h3>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No affiliation with opportunists</font></h3>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The first essential of revolutionary propaganda
and action is the existence of a Party with clear and uncompromising doctrine
and policy, which will persistently unmask and discredit the parties of
opportunism and compromise. A unity that is a unity in name only, is a
source of weakness, and not of strength. The spirit of self-discipline
and sacrifice which will animate all members of the Communist Party is
a guarantee that in the coming struggle the Party will be faithful to the
proletariat.</font>
<h3>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Third International</font></h3>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Third, or Red International, is organized
for the binding together of the workers throughout the world to fight the
forces of International Capitalism and Imperialism.</font>
<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">The Soviets</font></u></h2>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Soviets are built up mainly on an occupational
basis, and are at once the instrument of the dictatorship of the working
class and the means of organizing the Communist Society. To them will fall
the political direction of the Republic, its foreign and home policy, and
the management of the land and the socialized industries; on them will
rest the judicial power of the community. The Soviets appoint delegates
to Soviets covering wider areas, which Soviets in turn elect delegates
to National and International Soviets.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">The Soviet delegate must be instructed by,
and report to, those whom they represent, and shall be subject to recall
at any time.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">No person may vote, or be elected to the
Soviet who refuses to work for the community, who employes others for private
gain, engages private trading, or lives on accumulated wealth. In the Soviet
community such person will soon cease to exist.</font>
<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">The liberation of mothers and socialisation
of houses</font></u></h2>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Communism and Soviets will liberate mothers
from their present economic enslavement and drudgery. They will share like
others in the wealth of the community, elect their own representatives
to the Soviet. The introduction of communal housekeeping will open them
opportunities for leisure, recreation, and education hitherto unknown.
They, especially, will benefit by the socialisation of houses, with the
abolition of rent and the free and ample provision of furniture, fuel,
light, and all household implements.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">The Soviets will also make arrangements for
the maintenance by the whole community, of the old and the sick, and assure
to them the unquestioned right to the full satisfaction of their needs.
Hospitals, maternity and convalescent homes, and sanatoria shall be socialised.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">There will be generous provision of free
schools of elementary, secondary, higher and vocational education, universities
and colleges of arts and sciences Books and apparatus for study and wide
opportunities of recreation will be at the disposal of all.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">The period of universal education and freedom
from productive work, unless such work be undertaken with a purely educational
motive, shall extend to at least 20 years of age. All educational institutions
for people of all ages shall be free.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Education will be co-ordinated by the establishment
of teachers' Soviets, pupils' Soviets, parents' and teachers' Soviets,
and councils of education formed of delegates from these bodies and from
the Soviets. The maintenance of children and young persons shall be entirely
free.</font>
<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">The administration of justice</font></u></h2>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The judges in the Communist courts shall be
men and women elected by the Soviets, and shall be subject to recall at
any time. As far as possible, imprisonment shall be replaced by compulsory
labour and all places of detention shall be educational institutions.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Under Communism, courts of Justice will speedily
become unnecessary, since most of what is called crime has its origin in
economic need and in the evils and conventions of capitalist society.</font>
<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">The transition period</font></u></h2>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All those who are in possession of private property
shall be called upon to surrender it, and to work on equal terms with the
rest of the population.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Landlords and capitalists whose property
has been socialised shall receive no special compensation; they will be
offered work or maintenance on the same level as the rest of the community.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">The introduction of machinery, the spread
of scientific knowledge, the growth of large-scale production, make possible
the emancipation of labour, and the establishment of a Communist Society
in which there shall be no need to maintain either rationing or the wages
system, to limit the free use by the workers of the products of the community.
But there will be a transition period between Capitalism and Communism,
during which wages and other survivals of Capitalism will gradually disappear.
Throughout the transition period the Communist Party will be guided by
the determination to secure complete political and economic equality for
all workers.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">When the working class seize power, banks
must be confiscated and all private banking stopped. For the period in
which money and trading still continue, local and national Soviet banks
shall be set up and shall be the only banks.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Until the wage system has been altogether
abolished, wages shall be equal for all industries and professions, and
for all adults men and women in each industry and profession, from the
principal manager downwards. Managers, foremen and other occupying organizing
and directive posts shall be elected by the workers under them, or by the
Soviets. All Soviet officials and delegates shall receive the standard
wage during the time they are employed on Soviet work.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">The standard wage shall be paid during illness,
and unemployment. Mothers who are wage-earners shall also be paid the standard
wage when incapacitated from following their employment. Moreover, they
shall be provided with skilled household help during illness, or if they
are employed outside the home.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Even before the wages system is abolished
the people shall be spared from all fear of want by the free provision
of all staple necessaries, essential food, clothing, housing accomodation,
furniture, fuel, transport, light, and medical aid; whilst education and
full maintenance shall be free to the children. Scarce commodities shall
be equally rationed, and housing provided on the principle that before
anyone may have two rooms everyone must have one.</font>
<p><b><font face="Comic Sans MS">The members of the Communist Party (British
Section of the Third International), will constitute a body of volunteers,
disciplined now for the coming struggle; a body of men and women who have
made up their minds to achieve the revolution by working through self-discipline
to freedom.</font></b>
