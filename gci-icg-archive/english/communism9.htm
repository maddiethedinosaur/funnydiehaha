<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">1. Introduction</font></u></h2>
The <b>catastrophe of capitalist society</b> is not mysterious or impenetrable,
nor faraway nor something for the future! On the contrary, it is the <b>essential
and living</b> reality of bourgeois society, a product of its own limits.
These limits are located within Capital itself and patently manifest themselves
all over the world.
<p>Each large cycle of economic expansion necessarily ends in a depression.
To the development of the productive forces corresponds the imperious necessity
of their destruction. All accumulation of wealth produces misery to a proportional
extent. The concentration and centralisation of Capital carries with it
a growing contraction of the possibilities for lucrative investment.
<p>In opposition to all those who justify this system and who, each time
that a new cycle of expansion develops, pretend that never again will there
be another crisis, we communists- have always insisted on the intrinsic
limits of Capital. We've always insisted on the indissociable unity between
accumulation of Capital and accumulation of misery, between the development
of the productive forces and the concomitant catastrophe of society, between
"the wealth of nations" and imperialist war.
<p>Against the current of the various parties of order and in total antagonism
to social democracy, in opposition to fatalism and to all the dominant
illusions, we can only laugh at the proclamation of "a new world order"
supposedly purged of its contradictions. We claim loudly -in spite of our
isolation- that the coming catastrophes will be still more devastating
and that all attempts today to curb the internal contradictions of Capital
can only lead to the postponement and the exacerbation of their unavoidable
explosion.
<p>Once more, the validity of communist theory is being confirmed by current
events: the political, social and economic catastrophe is worldwide. Everywhere
the working class is being subjected to more misery, more unemployment,
more war... The capitalist world is less and less capable of hiding its
putrid reality.
<p>We do not intend, in this article, to quote all the figures or statistics
illustrating this catastrophe. Each one of us, all proletarians, live this
social disaster every day in our flesh. We will stress only some essential
aspects of the world situation so as to illustrate the depth of today's
catastrophe. We will make clear the violence with which this mode of production
is confronted with its own historical limits today. On the other hand,
we will highlight the unavoidability of a catastrophe that is generalised
to the whole of humanity, unless the latter manages to destroy all the
social market and labour relations that are crushing it.
<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">2. From the crash of the model of social
capitalism to the ruin of the archetype of the United States as an economy
to imitate !</font></u></h2>
These last years, we've witnessed the crash of the model of "socialist"
capitalism, of "social" capitalism, of the "social project" of the "bourgeois
left" (1). The Right finally triumphed and liberal capitalism could again
take up its place as the sole worldwide model, venerated by all bourgeois
factions.
<p>The "war of all against all" has always been at the basis of this society.
No reforms, no utopia, no attempts to "humanise" this society have ever
been able to change this reality. But while in the past they tried to hide
this reality, feeling shameful about it and talking at the same time about
helping the poor, today they openly claim that such atrocities as "the
poor getting poorer" are unavoidable. Never before has capitalism taken
on the liberal discourse to such an extent. Never before in the history
of this system have they asserted so <b>openly</b> that the growth of this
society necessitates the misery of the masses, and that the famous economic
development of society requires our sacrifice and the repression of all
insubordination. The discourse and the recipes of the IMF -in times past
considered to be the programme of the ultra-right- have become, over the
last few years, the only conceivable economic politics. Even the "economic"
model advocated by Pinochet (2) to get out of the crisis, has now become
famous again and those bourgeois factions who do not accept it are soon
edged out.
<p>It has now become clear that reformism and humanism are just idle politicking.
Capital doesn't care about those who've pretended to keep it under control;
it has shown that it is the only boss <b>who commands everything</b> and
that all those who've pretended to direct it, have been nothing else but
its mere executors (3). It has become all too clear that in this society
there is only one god to worship: PROFIT!
<p>But while reality became more and more forthright and world capitalism
sank into a generalised depression, the proletarian masses, anaesthetized
by TV, video, papers and other brain-washers, did not see the reality of
this crisis -as always, consciousness trailed behind. Capital could continue
to pretend that the USA, Japan and Germany were still valid models of liberal
market economic growth while in fact, everywhere, worldwide, capitalism
entered into a generalised depression. The economic catastrophe of capitalism
in the East was so violent and so fast that it remained possible to uphold
the conception that the liberal market economy remained superior and was
the only valid model free of all risks of crisis.
<p>Neither the clarity nor the brutality of the discourse asserting that
all development necessitates misery and sacrifices, could hinder the expansion
of the United States as a "model" to strive for. But in the United States
itself the catastrophe had reached such incredible proportions that it
could no longer be hidden (4). The "model" was only intended to be sold
abroad. The "model" was used for export only because in the United States
itself it had irremediably crashed and could no longer remain credible
in the eyes of millions of proletarians who had to face poverty and unemployment.
In this country, the "model" had reached a state of putrefaction. The sacrifices
that were called for for the sake of future development could no longer
be justified since it had become impossible to hide that this development
opposes itself to the immediate and historic interests of the human species.
During a whole period of economic growth, misery increased (in relative
terms, but also, in some aspects, in absolute terms) and all aspects of
human life deteriorated: more homeless; more famine; less health care;
massive drug addiction; increase in rapes, crimes and violence in general;
generalised pollution; development of racism in all strata of society;
militarisation of daily life...
<p>But the United States remained a "model" for export, because over the
last decades they were the motive force of world capital and represented
the antithesis to the pretention (by now completely obsolete) embodied
in the Soviet Union and its allies of checking and planifying the economy
(it is in this way that the United States became the very symbol of "triumphant
capitalism"). The imposition of the American "model" -in spite of blatant
reality-is also due to the way this reality is being reflected by the media,
and by the fact that whereas political managers are forced (by Capital
itself) to produce some immediate results, the same is not true for technocrats
and analysts who prepare the theories for the international media: they
can afford to water down reality, to produce optimistic images to replace
reality (that is their "raison d'&ecirc;tre").
<p>We would just like to draw attention to the fact that the "wellbeing"
that politicians depict, the model of society that they are offering us
today, is not some paradise, some utopia, but only an embellished image
of the United States. What a prospect!
<p>In the areas of the world where "anti-imperialism" against the United
States was a powerful ideology for controlling the proletariat, the positive
image of the United States was more powerful still. Not only was it pretended,
in these countries, that misery in the US could not possibly be compared
to misery elsewhere, since "the USA is a rich country", "a developed country"
(with a GNP of such an amount of US$ per inhabitant!), but moreover, <b>and
in full agreement with the interests of the bourgeoisie of this country
and of the whole world</b>, the importance of the historic struggles of
the proletariat in the United States was being tarnished or even completely
negated. The myth of a "labour aristocracy" systematically allowed the
overshadowing of the explosive character of the contradictions and the
historic importance of the struggle of our class brothers against Capital
and the State (5).
<p>Today's worldwide economic depression that strikes more particularly
the very heart of the command centre of the system -the productive space
of the United States- makes this contradiction even more complete. The
catastrophe of social and economic reality in the United States stands
more and more deeply in contradiction with its pretention to be the only
valid capitalist alternative.
<p>Without doubt it is difficult to grasp the exact meaning of the following
figures:
<ul>
<li>
a black person living in New-York has less chance to reach the age of 65
than an inhabitant of Bangladesh;</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
the rate of infant mortality is higher in Washington than in Jamaica or
in Chile;</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
in Los Angeles, 40.000 people sleep in the streets (1992).</li>
</ul>
It is probably difficult enough to understand the meaning of this misery
as mere misery; it is even more difficult to grasp its subversive, revolutionary
character.
<p>It has also proved difficult to make it understood that before the struggles
in Argentina (Cordobazo), before '68 in France or '69 in Italy, before
even the important proletarian struggles in China (led astray by what is
known as the "cultural revolution"), that the wave of proletarian struggles
had basically started in North-America, in the South of the United States,
in the North of Latin-America, in Santo Domingo, in Mexico,... MAINLY IN
THE BLACK AND HISPANIC GHETTOES OF LOS ANGELES.
<p>The revolt of our comrades of Los Angeles in May 1992 announces the
agony of the myth of the United States as a "model" to imitate, and prepares
the ground for today's struggles of the international proletariat. It shows
not only that the USA does not constitute a valid "model", but also that
this area is not safe from the wave of proletarian revolts that shake the
world. All this expresses a qualitative step forward in the nature of our
struggles and does away with the illusion that each time there should be
some "special" reason that explains the "particular" origin of such or
such a struggle.
<p>Thanks to this revolt during which our comrades from LA attacked the
State and its representatives, thanks to the strength with which they stood
up against the world of property, the last illusions about the American
"model", or about the supposed differences between the proletariat of this
country and of the rest of the world, have fallen to pieces.
<p>When in Poland or in Rumania revolts erupted, we were told that this
was because of the dictatorship and of the bureaucratic tendencies that
dominate these countries; when in Algeria, in Morocco or in South Africa
the proletariat rose up and clashed violently with bourgeois power, they
told us that this was because of the age-old backward situation of this
historically "underdeveloped" continent; when proletarians in Venezuela
and in Argentina attacked private property and the State, these struggles
were faked up to look like mere looting caused by famine and supposedly
peculiar to "Third World" countries; when in France and in Britain (in
Vaux-en-Velin, and Trafalgar Square for instance) the same class anger
expressed itself, they blamed marginals and immigrants... and today, when
at the very centre of the capitalist model revolts erupt, and when these
struggles spread from Los Angeles to the suburbs of Toronto, Washington
and New York, then what else can the international bourgeoisie do than
lie once more and claim that all this is only because of a problem "amongst
blacks and hispanics"! <b>But such an absurd story will undoubtedly be
difficult to impose and it becomes obvious that even for the bourgeoisie
the credibility of the American "model" starts getting into bad shape.</b>
<p>For the world bourgeoisie, a model of development remains attractive
as long as it works. It can remain attractive even when proletarians are
starving to death (and this is one of the historic conditions for all intensive
growth of industry!) and when the main cities get filled up with unemployed
and beggars. But the charm of such a model fades away as soon as proletarians
start to rebel and challenge the established order.
<p>This is why, when Bush was forced to bloodily repress the revolt in
Los Angeles, the myth of the North American "model" disappeared as if by
magic. All the big chiefs of the world industrial giant, all Presidents,
Ministers... quickly announced their opposition to the North American "model"
and declared that the revolt was due to the particular conditions in the
USA... i.e. could not possibly occur in their own country!
<p>It is always the same song: the proletariat supposedly never fights
against capitalist misery, but always against abuses or "abnormal" developments
of the system. This is how the "racist abuses that exist in the USA"...
or still, "neoliberalism", or "Reaganomics", etc. where blamed for having
caused the struggles that shook the USA in 1992.
<p>These clumsy justifications serve the aim of hiding that the revolt
of the proletariat in Los Angeles was directed against the enemies that
oppress us, and therefore expresses the interests of all proletarians all
over the world. They try to conceal that in the whole world their system
is the same, that the struggle of proletarians in Los Angeles is our own,
and that, while we fight against the bourgeoisie of "our" country, we stand
on the same side of the barricades as our class comrades in Los Angeles.

<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">3. Even the positive poles of capitalism
do not escape from catastrophe</font></u></h2>
In general, Capital puts forward its positive pole while rejecting its
negative pole as not being its own (and generally explaining it by a "lack
of capitalist development"!). Capital puts forward as being its own achievements:
wealth, the development of productive forces, progress, peace, flourishing
business, democracy... and rejects as being hostile to its own being everything
which might bother this idyllic picture. The misery of always larger strata
of proletarian masses is understood as a lack of integration of these masses
into capitalist society, or still as a lack of development in the related
areas. Open repression and State terror are depicted as the result of the
actions of a particular "dictator", all irregularities supposedly are due
to some "bad manager" or some corrupt government (6), racism (intrinsic
to capitalist society!) supposedly is due to some particular "right-wing"
bourgeois faction, and all capitalist misery, the ghettoes, favelas, shanty
towns, pollution... are always being considered as temporary. And always
Capital will put forward the need for more capitalist development, more
progress as the sole medicine capable of curing these "abnormalities".
<p>As always, revolutionary communism denounces these lies (7) and insists
on the fact that war, famine, crisis, unemployment, racism... are not foreign
to capitalist development, but are its authentic products!
<p>What has changed today, with the vertiginous worldwide depression, is
that Capital no longer has a positive pole to exhibit, that there are no
more "model" countries to imitate.
<p>Today (october 1992) in the United States, factories close down one
after the other, misery is growing beyond all limits and social decomposition
has reached a peak. This destroys the myth of an American economy being
safe from crisis. But, on top of this, even such countries as Germany or
Japan, which used to be considered -no longer than two years ago- as "models"
of economic growth and of dynamism, are severely hit by the generalised
depression.
<p>For instance, the Tokyo stock market, supreme representative of "Japanese
dynamism" and former "model" for investors of the whole world, hasn't stopped
collapsing since 1989: its index that had reached 38,600 in 1989, fell
back to 14,300 in the summer of 1992. This represents a drop of 63%. And
as far as the other models of development are concerned, the situation
is hardly any more brilliant. As a matter of fact, the whole of Western
Europe is sinking into a generalised depression: the system of monetary
parity, generally considered to be the most solid of all, has broken down.
London is announcing closures and bankruptcies every day, the Italian economy
is sinking into chaos and the other countries are trying to resist as well
as can be expected. Whole sectors of the economy, the most representative
corporations of capitalist progress and dynamism, go bankrupt or have to
announce a fall in profits, redundancies and so on.
<p>On the international level, the case of Pan American for sure is the
most typical one because it is the main calling card of the US. But other
companies in the US as well, such as TWA, Eastern or Braniff are in the
same situation. On the other continents, the situation is hardly any better:
Lufthansa, Air France, SAS, Sabena... are announcing ever greater losses.
Aeroflot, the company that has the biggest air fleet and the highest number
of flying hours in the whole world, is also facing increasing difficulties.
<p>The same goes for the car industry. General Motors, the historic symbol
of social and democratic North American capitalism (8), announces incredible
losses and drastic cuts in jobs. Ford and Chrysler the same. Other sectors
of industry as well are faced with identical problems. AT&amp;T, the biggest
communications company of the whole world, had to admit several thousands
of million $US of losses in 1991. IBM is continuously planning new restructurations
and new strategies and anticipates massive lay-offs. NCR and Digital Equipment
are also sacking workers massively.
<p>So it is hardly surprising that faced with such "models" of dynamism,
development, democracy, or economic efficiency... that the growth of the
world GNP for the first time is nearly zero, and that all estimations confirm
the provision (for the first time ever) for a reduction in international
trade in volume (about 3%) and in value (about 1.5%).
<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">4. The bourgeois solutions to the generalised
depression</font></u></h2>
The bourgeoisie can no longer hide the generalised depression of the worldwide
capitalist economy. That's why they've now started to tell us another story,
asserting that the end of the crisis is near, that the economic takeoff
will be there tomorrow, and that next year at the latest the "recession"
will be over. But no sooner have they formulated these optimistic forecasts,
when already they change them and start reconsidering the delays in the
prospects they've announced. This once more illustrates that it is Capital
that determines the planifications and perspectives, not the other way
round (9).
<p>In as little time as it took for the world bourgeoisie to rally round
the general apology of liberalism, the various managers and economists
have already started to call for State intervention again. The most determined
defenders of the "invisible hand" (i.e. of the automatic regulation of
economic life without State intervention) started to call for such or such
measures in order to increase credit to companies, to increase effective
demand, and they criticise the management by former administrations blamed
for provoking chaos.
<p>This is no surprise to us. The myth of the invisible hand perfectly
regulating the economy, is a myth that during a period of economic growth
is always being supported by the dominant ideology. But as soon as capitalism
gets into a new cycle of crisis, this myth collapses. Capitalist cycles
take place according to a scheme that hardly ever varies. During periods
of depression, all bourgeois factions fight against the tendency of the
rate of profit to fall. They feel in their bones that the markets get narrower
and narrower, and that they no longer expand at a pace required by capitalist
accumulation (10). These bourgeois factions then call for political interventions
to protect the process of accumulation from devalorisation; either by counter-balancing
as much as possible the tendency of the rate of profit to fall and this
generally results in an increase in the rate of exploitation; or by trying
artificially to enlarge the markets through the extension of credit payments,
by public expenditures, by the militarisation of social life... Today is
only a repetition of the past.
<p>However, if the general scheme hardly ever varies, nevertheless the
situation changes because each crisis is always more acute than the previous
one. The contradictions that in the past were hidden and postponed, now
explode even more violently. The economic politics that have been used
in the past in order to artificially increase effective demand transform
themselves into additional problems. In all sectors Capital is being confronted
with its historic limits.
<p>We can take the example of companies that manage to remain on an even
keel because they benefit from different forms of protection (subsidies,
commercial protection, free credit), in complete contradiction however
with the law of value that condemns them to close down and sack their work
force. With each economic cycle, such companies move further away from
a "natural" profitability (i.e. a profitability obtained through the famous
"invisible hand"). Each year it takes more subsidies, more cheap credit,
more measures of economic protection... to keep them on an even keel. These
procedures -that result in increasing public deficit in order to finance
companies that are no longer economically viable- become more and more
perilous and they stand in contradiction with other sectors of Capital
who do not accept that the State allocates their surplus value with the
aim of helping obsolete companies to survive that have become completely
devalorised. For Capital, the dilemma becomes more acute: on the one hand
the "natural" necessity to close down factories, producing millions more
unemployed - and this in turn will reduce effective demand even more, and
is likely to provoke inevitable social explosions; on the other hand, the
"choice" to postpone this economic truth again, knowing perfectly well
that generalised bankruptcy will become all the more violent. This kind
of problematics will generalise itself and involve an always growing number
of countries or blocs of countries until the situation will become unbearable
and the bourgeois faction in charge of government gets swept away by another
one that will start again to hold up the flag of liberalism, but will also
inevitably soon have to confront the moment of truth! This was the case,
a few decades ago, in South America with industrial populism. This is what
has been going on in the "East" countries such as the Soviet Union, Romania,
Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary... (11) over the last few years. And this
is also the tendency today in countries like the United States or Britain,
for instance.
<p>The artificial increase of demand on the basis of private and public
credit, of public expenditure, or of "welfare politics", has not only allowed
capitalism to continue to function, but also to get out of situations of
economic depression and to enter, provisionally, into a phase of expansion.
The United States in particular, is a good example of national Capital
having been propelled beyond its limits on the basis of artificial creation
of solvent demand. In this country, even more than in all others, public
expenditure has reached astronomic levels (especially in the field of military
industry). In this country, they've acted as if there was no limit to the
granting of credit to private industry and they've multiplied, at rates
unheard of before, all possible credits to the customer without taking
into account his real earnings. This policy could be used in the United
States more than anywhere else since this country has the possibility to
issue -to an <b>apparently</b> unlimited extend- the unit of value, not
only as an expansive internal policy, but also because of the role played
by the $US on the world market in general (as a matter of fact, in spite
of the failure of the Bretton Woods agreements, the United States continues
to function as the central bank of the worldwide capitalist system) as
well as on the domestic market of numerous countries. This has allowed
for an increase in demand without -in spite of this- immediately creating
a generalised devalorisation of the unit of value (as happens in other
countries when the local State issues illconsidered amounts of money).
Indeed, international trade today absorbs an incalculable amount of these
units of value. In the beginning of the Seventies, when worldwide capitalism
was confronting the objective limits of expansion following generalised
destruction caused by war, these policies were what allowed the successive
economic expansions of the post-war period to be financed (12). Due to
these policies, the national economy of the United States could impose
itself as the uncontested motor of worldwide capitalism during this period.
<p>We should not forget that if Reaganite (or Thatcherite) liberalism has
pretended to be anti-interventionist to the point of flirting with fashionable
anarcho-capitalist ideologies (13), this is because it clearly advocated
the abandonment of all social illusions within the capitalist system. Its
politics of no taxes on capital stood in full agreement with the cuts it
operated in the whole of the "social budget". The consequences of such
policies resulted in a short-lived recomposition of the main driving force
of the economy, the rate of profit. At the same time a relative fall of
salaries occurred, i.e. a net increase of the rate of exploitation. However,
they did not have the courage to take these politics to their ultimate
consequences nor to abandon at the same time the whole of the credit allocation
facilities (14) because this would have caused an even worse and more abrupt
catastrophe. On the contrary, they tried to combine the generalised increase
in the rate of exploitation (due to a reduction of the overall income of
the work force - including unemployment allocations, welfare and so on)
as well as the decrease in taxes (15) with the widespread expansion of
State sponsored credit. This has resulted in the hugest fiscal deficit
ever accumulated in the history of world capitalism. While the official
discourse was about liberalism and promised to reduce or even completely
eliminate the fiscal deficit, it remained obvious that capitalist reality
demanded the preservation of an economy based on public expenditure (particularly
the war economy) and the application of Keynesian economic politics.
<p>But since, in spite of this, no economic growth ensued, these economic
politics failed and illusions vanished. At the same time the international
bourgeois class never stopped predicting the coming of a new golden age,
the coming of a new economic expansion that would put an end to today's
generalised depression. Even today still, in spite of the obvious worsening
of the world economic situation and mainly in the biggest examples of triumphant
national economies (United States, Japan, Germany, Britain, Italy...),
not one day passes by without having some politician, some economist or
some journalist telling us that soon we'll be delivered from the economic
crisis and get back to the golden age of capitalist prosperity.
<p>But beyond all these nice words and promises, <b>the procedure remains
the same</b>: lowering of the interest rates (basically through the lowering
of the discount rate of the Central Banks in order to favour credit and
investment) and increase of public expenditures. This can only be achieved
by <b>increasing always more public and private debt, internal and external.</b>
<p>This is exactly what has been done up till now and this is the source
of today's generalised chaos. All speeches, all promises of expansionist
economic politics, only serve the purpose of injecting some more morphine
into moribund capitalism.
<p>In 1985, in an article against the various myths concerning the external
debt of "Latin American countries", we already stressed the fact that this
corresponded not to a particular phenomenon but to the generalised and
insoluble situation of worldwide capitalism.
<blockquote>"Faced with the end of the phase of expansion that followed
the second world war (during the whole history of capitalism, wars, reconstruction
periods, routed proletarians... have always been the inevitable antecedents
that have made an ulterior "healthy" development possible), <b>worldwide
capitalism</b> has only succeeded in postponing catastrophic depressions,
while creating huge amounts of <b>fictitious capital</b>. The levels that
were reached in this field, not only in absolute terms, but also in relative
terms compared to world production, are far ahead of what ever existed
before. Even more so, the most incredible anarchy and the absence of widespread
control in the relationship between these two magnitudes (between fictitious
capital and the production of goods) prevails on the international scale.
For the future phases of depression, this preludes that such a situation
will become multiplied (or expressed differently, will be raised to a power
with unpredictable consequences) by the massive and brutal destruction
of fictitious capital, blowing up all contradictions of this social system
at a level unheard of until now. The different stages of easy and widespread
credit during the post-war period, the massive debt of all governments,
as well as the unrestrained creation of units of value that in fact do
not represent any value, correspond to always shorter and weaker takeoffs
of the world economy. These kind of drugs administered to an exhausted
body have at each cycle produced a stimulating effect. But it made the
system of enlarged international reproduction of Capital function as if
it was a child... until the effect wears out and a higher dose of drugs
becomes necessary. Then after a while even higher doses of drugs produce
no more effect and finally the remedy becomes worse than the illness...
and in the end, Capital appears as it really is, an enuretic and rotten
morphine addicted corpse.</blockquote>

<blockquote>For the proletariat, the only real perspective for the human
species, it is fundamental to expose this worldwide diabolical dynamic:
against all dominating myths, it is of vital importance to reveal that
debt (or rather today's generalised and insoluble debt) is nothing else
but one of the most remarkable manifestations of the anarchy and of the
historical end of a social system that engulfs all of mankind." (16)</blockquote>
So the increase in expenditure and of public debt have been the historical
remedies that have allowed, in each country and for a given period, a certain
growth beyond the real limits of production. These therapies have been
used each time again on the world level, and we can assert that world production
and trade over the last decays could only function "adequately" <b>because
of such policies</b>... but this is precisely what has brought about the
present situation of default in payment. And the worst for world capital
is that <b>even today's rhythm of growth, nearly zero, can only be maintained
through an increase in international debt</b>, i.e. by the implementation
of the very economic policies that have become totally unbearable for Capital
today.
<p>A little bit more than ten years ago, the financial catastrophe was
so bad that most Latin American countries, as well as many countries from
other continents, threatened to stop debt repayment. Straight away, the
granting of credit was cut down for a large number of them. The same happened
a bit later in various African States and in several East European countries.
Then for a while the world bourgeoisie cherished the illusion that growth
would continue anyway, "in spite of everything", thanks to the socalled
"new effective demand" that was supposed to come from the East (17). But
soon these new illusions vanished as well, and once again they had to apply
the policies of easy credit so as to create solvent buyers... while only
necessities existed... but these policies also ran out after a few years.
Simultaneously, in other parts of the world, the same limits as those that
we know today were reached: the US is a very clear example of this: if
we add the debts of consumers, of companies and of the central government
of this country, we reach an astronomical number superior to $US10000 billion,
which equals 2 years of national production in this country!
<p>In spite of all these efforts, in spite of all these therapies to revitalize
Capital, in spite of the existence of such artificial buyers, in spite
of the mass of investments financed through credit, in spite of the extent
of fictitious demand created by the Keynesian multiplier (18), today all
these vain promises about the "end of recession" fall apart one after the
other.
<p>But could there possibly be any other unexplored possibilities to allow
Capital to overcome today's generalised depression? Could there be any
other bourgeois politics than those that have been implemented until now?
<b>The
answer is no. Categorically no!!!</b> (19)
<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">5. Exacerbation of class war and of imperialist
war</font></u></h2>
But worldwide Capital does not reason as worldwide Capital and is not conscious
about the non-existence of a political economy that would allow itself
to continue to grow beyond all limits. Capital considers these limits to
be temporary, and it considers itself to be the highest and final stage
of development in history. Of course it envisages changes, but it does
not envisage its fall. Moreover, it does not have any capacity of worldwide,
centralised decision-making; quite to the contrary, it is essentially ungovernable.
<p>Decisions are not taken either by worldwide Capital, nor by Capital
in general, but by each particular Capital, by each particle of Capital.
It is because of this reason, in such situations without any capitalist
general solution, as is the case today, that <b>the decomposition of Capital
into particles</b> accelerates, that competition grows stronger still and
that the generalised "run for your life" (the true rule of this society)
materializes when each has to walk on the head of his neighbour in order
to survive.
<p>This "neighbour" of course is first of all <b>the proletariat</b>, its
"own" proletariat and the capitalist will not skimp on any efforts in order
to increase the <b>rate of exploitation</b>. But the "neighbour" is also
personified by the <b>bourgeois competitor</b>, and each capitalist is
ready to destroy this neighbour by waging <b>commercial war</b> until its
ultimate consequences: <b>military war</b>.
<p>So what matters is not what the capitalist wants or does not want, whether
he's "left" or "right", whether he's the director of a multinational or
of the Cuban State. What matters is what each capitalist is forced to do,
in accordance with his function as a manager. As Marx would have said,
he's nothing else but <b>the creature of value valorising itself, of the
social relation reproducing itself</b> (20) and in this sense he's not
responsible for what he's doing since he's obliged to act that way by Capital.
We feel that this assertion is essential to fight against all illusions
about the capacities of such or such a capitalist, of such or such a manager
to act differently from the way Capital forces him to act (21).
<p>This is the <b>general explanation of what is happening at present and
of what we're living daily</b>: always stronger restrictions, increasing
misery, more unemployment... it is the explanation of the <b>always more
murderous war against the proletariat</b>. And it is also the explanation
of the unceasing increase in local wars and of the intensification of <b>inter-bourgeois
wars</b>. These wars materialize through the marked increase in protectionism,
the rupture of commercial agreements, through the difficulty of bringing
trade agreements to a longlasting successful conclusion, as we can witness
with the GATT negotiations (22); also through the rupture of the old alliances
(and we shouldn't forget that countries and unions of countries are nothing
else but inter-bourgeois alliances trying to confront other capitalist
factions!), through the rupture of commercial and military blocs, through
the constitution of new imperialist constellations...
<p>However, it is clear that the austerity measures -the lowering of real
wages, the increase in intensity and hours of labour in order to reach
the same level of production with less workers (i.e. while paying less
in wages), all the measures recommended by generalised liberalism and which
result in a net increase in the rate of exploitation and of profitability
for particular capitalists- including when this concerns an entire country
(and when the bourgeois of that country benefit from this), all these measures
are prejudicial to capital in general <b>since they reduce the worldwide
effective demand</b>. This for instance is what was practised by the Pinochet
government. The violent lowering of real wages (and even more so of relative
wages) and the increase in the rate of exploitation and of profit, have
attracted capitals from the whole world and allowed for an acceleration
in national growth. But, logically, the excess of surplus-value that was
produced in this way could not be reinvested in the same country and necessarily
had to be introduced on to the market of other national capitals, in order
to realize itself; this shows clearly that this kind of policy is a short
run policy or -if you prefer- that it will necessarily come into contradiction
with the interests of proletarians but also with those of other national
capitals, and <u>that it cannot possibly bring about a solution on the
level of global Capital</u>.
<p>The other so-called antagonistic policy by which nation States try to
manage the contradiction between particular and global capital consists
in increasing fictitious demand. This does not bring about a global solution
either and will also lead to war. In the face of the tendency for each
particular capital to increase beyond all limits the rate of exploitation
and of profit, nation States always represent a higher level of globality
for Capital (23). The managers of the State and their ideologists, economists
and sociologists as well as being apologetic about existing social relations,
all try to abstract themselves from immediate reality; they'll advocate
an economic policy that imposes discipline on each particular capital not
only on the basis of governmental efforts (public expenditure, budget deficit...)
but also through the establishment of a series of rules for each particular
capital (minimum wage, maximum working hours...). This allows the State
to represent itself more easily as being "beneficial for the whole of society"
(24). All populist regimes, from Hitler to Fidel Castro and from Roosevelt
to Stalin, have tried to implement such policies but its most thorough
theorization is Keynesianism. This policy can also only be a short term
policy, since in the long run <b>all contradictions are postponed, accumulated,
exacerbated</b>(25). It can only be a national policy and not a worldwide
one since it stands in contradiction with the international competitiveness
of the companies of the countries that apply such a policy and because
sooner or later it will lead to the accumulation of deficits of the balance
of payments and of the balance of trade as well as reinforcing protectionism.
It will lead to the confirmation of its weakness in the commercial war
and this unavoidably will raise the need to pursue this policy in the <b>military</b>
field. It is clear also that people cannot just be hired to dig holes that
other people will fill in -what dynamises the national economy most is
a war economy! And since each national capital considers those who stand
in competition with itself, who take "its" raw materials, who sell cheaper,
who attack its position on the markets... to be its enemies, the drive
towards <b>war</b> will become always more imperious. So this policy also
can only lead towards
<b>imperialist war</b>, and its most consistent theoreticians
-like Keynes himself- never really felt emmbarrassed to admit that since
war is necessary to save capitalism, one had to prepare for it.
<p><b>All this</b> leads to an increase in the number of local wars, to
the decomposition of old alliances and nations, to the constitution of
new fronts and imperialist constellations and to the generalisation of
war to the whole planet. <b>Such is the capitalist perspective.</b>
<p>And without mentioning the whole series of accidents and daily catastrophes
that Capital imposes on the worldwide population, such as nuclear accidents
or the multiplication of areas where children are born with various physical
defects because of pollution and contamination that their parents have
been exposed to (26). And without taking into account that what Capital
is proposing as a model (life in a modern city for instance) could not
possibly be generalised to the whole of humanity because this simply would
jeopardize the survival of the planet earth.
<p>"You are being one-sided" we are told. No, we are not onesided, but
it is Capital that is one-sided, <b>its own progress leads to crisis, to
destruction and to war</b>. This society is a cannibalistic society, the
development of Capital feeds itself with human beings, it destroys them,
kills them, swallows them. <b>And on the level of the whole planet the
present situation stands as a blatant confirmation of our conception, a
categorical confirmation of communist theory.</b>
<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">6. War is everywhere</font></u></h2>
"New World Order", "the end of Communism", "an era of peace and prosperity",
"the end of history"... they would like to make us believe that humanity
has reached a level beyond which it can not develop any further! One of
their ideologists even declared that:
<blockquote><i>"liberal democracy can be the final point of the ideological
evolution of humanity and the final form of all human government; as such
it can be the final point of history."</i> (27)</blockquote>
Worldwide capitalist reality everyday contradicts the speeches by the apologists
of the system: never before have there been so many territories at war,
so many military and para-military clashes; never before has there been
such a mass of corpses caused by capitalist war (and peace!); never before
in human history has militarism taken such an important place in life and
never before has the production of arms and their commercialisation been
so colossal; never before -in relative and absolute terms- have such large
numbers of human beings been confronted with the daily reality of war (and/or
with the possibility of the launching of war at almost any time) and with
all the consequences that go with it.
<p>Today, <b>war is everywhere</b>; not a single continent escapes from
it. War is going on in former Yugoslavia, in former USSR, in Somalia, in
Turkey, in Iraq, Burma, in the Philippines, in Lebanon, Chad, in CentralAmerica...
without mentioning those other imperialist wars, like the "drug war" in
Bolivia, in Peru, in Colombia, in Brazil... that also directly attack millions
of proletarians.
<p>Experts in political science have listed 125 "centres of ethnic conflict"
in the former Russian bloc, of which 25 have already degenerated into open
armed clashes. Nearly every day a new armed confrontation takes place;
nearly every day a new "nation calling for self-determination" rises up.
Each caricature of a "republic" in the former USSR has its own "home-made"
contradiction because such or such of its minorities threatens to promulgate
its independence. Almost daily new curfews are being imposed in such or
such area and more central armies are being called in to put down more
local ones. One day, such or such an imperialist power -in full agreement
with its expansionist interests- recognises the right to self-determination
for such and such a new "State" and the next day -still in agreement with
its expansionist interests- the same power refuses the same right to some
other State. In this game of profits and numbers, of speculation and stock-exchange,
of alliances and ruptures (28), thousands of corpses of men, women and
children, thousands of wounded and disabled people... just pile up while
the rest of the population in these regions survives precariously in the
midst of ruins, famine and a general shortage of everything. No need to
go to Somalia or Ethiopia (where the situation is getting more dramatic
everyday) to attest that the population is facing starvation. In the former
USSR, and in spite of all Western "aid" in order to maintain bourgeois
law and order, famine is threatening and a rate of 90% of the population
living in poverty is officially admitted.
<p>It really is no longer possible to hide the <b>destructive and cannibalistic</b>
character of this mode of production!!!
<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">7. Catastrophe and Revolution</font></u></h2>
The <b>catastrophe of the capitalist world</b> is subjecting the proletariat
to <b>a hellish situation</b> of death, famine, misery, permanent insecurity,
war... And this situation <b>can only get worse</b>.
<p>Everywhere, Capital is facing its own limits and this opposes it irremediably
to the human species and <b>forces</b> the latter to destroy Capital if
it does not want itself to be destroyed.
<p><b>Economic growth zero; economic policies to bring the crisis to an
end that have all failed; war, its generalisation and the historical opposition
to humanity that is the only outcome of all capitalist efforts; and even
more so the unique result of the economic growth of Capital can only be
a generalised worsening catastrophe.</b>
<p>If today all capitalist models collapse, it's because their extension
is no longer possible; because if we hypothetically project today's economic
growth into the future we can see that this would lead to the generalised
destruction of even the most fundamental aspects of human life; because
all life on this whole planet would simply die if the model of the United
States were to be generalised everywhere; because the planet and humanity
could not possibly survive if New York (and other big cities) instead of
having 20 million inhabitants, would have 50 million! (29)
<p>The destruction of the ozone layer, generalised pollution of the atmosphere
and of water, global warming, desertification, destruction of forests...
and all other disastrous consequences for the human species are only the
isolated aspects of a <b>colossal planetary catastrophe</b>.
<p>Everywhere, capitalism has reached the <b>historical limit of its possibilities
of existence</b>, and the <b>great tragedy for the human species</b> is
that Capital is carrying on at our expense because we are not capable of
destroying it.
<p><b>This is the big problem for humanity: the catastrophe</b>, as we
wrote at the beginning of this article, <b>is not for the future but very
much of the living, dreadful, present</b>.
<p>In this sense, the problem of revolution is not the problem of such
or such "party", of such or such sect, of such or such social group, but
it is the problem of <b>the whole proletariat, of humanity as a whole</b>.
<p>In the face of the barbarism of the capitalist world, in the face of
the exacerbation of crisis and war, in the face of always increasing attacks
on its conditions of living and struggle, <b>the proletariat has always
revolted and we do not doubt that in the near future it will rise up again
even stronger</b>.
<p>We can't pretend that over the last few years there haven't been any
proletarian struggles. <b>As a matter of fact, there have been many.</b>
In certain cases, like in Iraq, Burma, Algeria, Venezuela, Los Angeles...
these struggles were very radical and hit at the very centres of power
of capital and its State, without allowing themselves to be controlled
by the unions or by any other bourgeois party of law and order. But today's
main problem is that these strikes, revolts, demos... <b>do not have any
continuity, do not have any direction, do not have any international links
between them</b>.
<p>We can't pretend that there have been no major explosions of proletarian
outrage, and we've welcomed them. But we have to admit that they've lacked
organisation and that for this reason, in many cases, they could easily
be defeated and this allowed the State to step up its terror again.
<p>We can't say that proletarians during these revolts didn't recognise
their interests, since -for instance- they have opposed imperialist war,
they've deserted, disobeyed, killed the officers that tried to send them
to the battlefields, executed hundreds of policemen and other capitalist
lackeys, as in Iraq. But due to a lack of structures and international
and internationalist directives, such revolts have been isolated and contained
by the nationalist bourgeois forces and this has meant a defeat of the
internationalist militants.
<p>We can't say either that these struggling proletarians do not know who
they're attacking since, in general, through these revolts, they attack
private property and its defenders and they seize whatever they need. The
big problem is that a few days later everything gets "back to normal",
to the sad daily struggle for survival where everybody tries to get by
on their own and Capital dominates again.
<p>We can't say that they have not confronted the State's servants, the
policemen, clerics and other religious functionaries, leaders from left
and right, trade unionists and journalists... since it is against these
people that proletarian rage has been directed in the first place. But
we have to admit that a majority of these State lackeys still sleep soundly
in their beds while many of our comrades die on the battlefields or are
in prison.
<p>There exists an enormous disproportion between, on the one hand, the
catastrophe of this society and the potential for explosion of the proletariat
and on the other hand the lack of basic structures of our class, such structures
that would lead us not to the repetition of 10, 100, 1000 revolts... but
to an international social revolution.
<p>We lack <b>workers' associationism, international structures for contact,
organisations, directives, a class consciousness of our objectives, capacities
to coordinate, to decide in relation to the interests of the whole movement</b>,
to transform common international interests into converging actions that
coincide in time... In short, more than ever we're in need of <b>structuring
the real community of struggle</b>, constituting it as an <b>organised
force</b>, as an <b>internationalist communist Party</b>.
<p>Capitalism itself does not leave any other choice to the proletariat,
to humanity.

<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">Notes</font></u></h3>
1. We've used inverted commas here to designate the "bourgeois left", because,
although this term is being commonly used and although we do not know any
other term to express this concept, from a revolutionary point of view
the distinction between the left and right of the bourgeois class is not
a real distinction. Not only must we stress that there is not the slightest
essential difference between the social project of "left" and "right" as
far as the defence of bourgeois order is concerned (and therefore we also
put the term "social project" between inverted commas) but moreover, there
are not any specific characteristics that would allow us to distinguish
the economic politics of the "left" from those of the "right". This explains
the coincidence between the kind of methods of organisation used by the
model of "socialist" capitalism and the ones applied and promoted by such
"leftists" as Hitler or Mussolini. Beyond certain oppositions as far as
their talk is concerned, it is obvious that there exists a full identity
of their class interests, but also of their economic project (for instance,
protectionism) which allows us to reject categorically all supposed distinctions
between these two capitalist factions. For example, if historically we
can make a valuable distinction between the various agrarian, banking or
industrial bourgeois factions, since they each have clear factional interests
and corresponding economic politics, nothing similar can be done as far
as "Left" or "Right" are concerned.
<p>2. Pinochet's Christian Democrat successors talk shamefully of the "economic"
model and, all the while pursuing its politics, claim that they are only
applying it to the "economy", that is not in the "social" or "political"
sense. As if it wasn't the economy which had obliged Pinochet to apply
Pinochetism on the political and social plains: poverty and open state
terrorism.
<p>3. The most spectacular example of a historical attempt to develop and
check Capital, is given by the Bolsheviks, filled with their social democratic
ideology, starting in 1917. The failure was devastating -and could not
have been any different- and Capital again became the only real social
subject, transforming the Bolshevik party and its leaders into mere puppets.
<p>4. Cf. "Quelques records du mod&egrave;le &eacute;conomique mondial:
USA" in <i>Communisme</i> No.36 (June 1992).
<p>5. In some countries, like Iran, the State does not hesitate to put
forward in its propaganda the "miserable situation of the poor" in the
USA. They try to use the contradictions in the USA (between wealth and
poverty, for instance) to depict this country as "a satan" and try to make
proletarians in Iran reject the "corrupt western way of life". Their aim
is to rally the proletariat behind their own ideological model and ("Islamic")
values. This was one of the ways that the State in Iran used to defeat
the very radical attack by the revolutionary proletariat during the 1979
uprisings against capitalist misery and its defenders (for instance through
the promotion of such "radical" slogans as "Neither East nor West").
<p>6. Corruption is not an "irregularity", it is the normal functioning
of the ruling social system. In the same way, the existence of such or
such a "mafia" is in reality nothing more than one of the expressions of
the bourgeois State or, to be more precise, the blanket with which it covers
itself in order to exonerate itself. The accusation enables one fraction
to whitewash itself (of the things that they all do) while throwing the
blame onto a rival fraction. At the same time this allows them to present
the State as a neutral apparatus manipulated by bad administrators.
<p>7. It is clear that most of the time those who support such lies and
illusions, are themselves taken in by them and believe what they are saying.
But nevertheless, these lies remain nothing but lies and in the historic
war that the bourgeoisie is waging against the proletariat, they are manoeuvres
to disorient and disorganise our class.
<p>8. The reader should remind themselves that this company has always
been presented as ideal not with respect to its size and economic clout
(superior to that of some countries) but also because the workers have
the opportunity to become shareholders. General Motors actually has the
greatest number of workers who have become legal owners of their company
in the world (the figure amounts to several hundred thousand). Of course
this is part of and reinforces the myth legal ownership can never assure
economic disposal of the means of production, that is to say their true
ownership.
<p>9. The illusion of controlling and planifying capitalist development
is a permanent feature of all bourgeois factions, including the liberals.
But Capital -a monster without head and that nobody can control- doesn't
care about this and laughs at all economists and planners. This confirms
the theory of our historic party which asserts that it is anarchy that
rules the capitalist world.
<p>10. The lack of markets and the fall of the rate of profit are of course
nothing else, from our point of view, but the <b>manifestations</b> as
they are being experienced -more or less violently- by capitalists (directly
in their wallets!) and by the whole of bourgeois society -manifestations
of <b>the immanent contradiction</b> of Capital. Bourgeois society, that
is nothing else but the process of value valorising itself, can only concretise
such valorisation by provoking always more violent, more generalised and
more devastating devalorisations.
<p>11. This explains why the Gross Product of entire countries not only
stagnates, but even decreases. Estimates forecast a fall of 18% of the
industrial production of the former Soviet Union, and of an average 9.7%
for the other East European countries!
<p>12. The growth of the Gross Domestic Product of Japan and the main Western
European countries during the post-war period, has shrunk from 5.6% for
the period from 1950 to 1973, to 2.1% for the years that followed; in the
United States it shrunk from 3.7% to 2.3% during the same period. We can
assert that from 1973 onwards -on the world level- the growth of the GDP
has been maintained thanks to this policy of credit expansion, in complete
disproportion with real production.
<p>13. These capitalist ideologies oppose themselves to all State intervention
and pretend to be anti-State. They pretend to substitute private companies
for the necessary capitalist bureaucracy, including in the field of policing.
In spite of today's acknowledged success of private police forces and employers'
militia in numerous countries and sectors -we should not forget that this
has always existed- it is clear that capitalism will never be able to avoid
centralising itself as a State.
<p>14. In a more general way, we can assert that liberalism and protectionism
are always relative. It is only normal that the champions of liberalism
did not go as far as interfering with other more structural protections
of the American or British productive space, such as the generalised protection
of the agricultural sector.
<p>15. Properly speaking, one cannot say that a reduction in taxes, as
such, provokes an increase in the rate of exploitation. Whether it be the
State or private bourgeois factions that appropriate surplus-value, from
our point of view the result is the same and we qualify this as a simple
transfer of value. Nevertheless, because of this for each particular capitalist
the ratio increases between the amount of surplusvalue that he gets and
the salaries that he has to pay (the <u>particular</u> rate of exploitation
or of surplus-value), and therefore the ratio between this surplus-value
and the whole of capital that this particular capitalist has invested.
It is this reality that allows us to formulate things in this way and to
consider that such measures increase the rate of exploitation and of profit
(for each particular capital). On the other hand, it is precisely to obtain
this result that these politics are being adopted. The aim is not to increase
the global social rate of exploitation, but rather the private rate of
exploitation of each capitalist. This is how they try to stimulate investment
and the accumulation of productive capital.
<p>16. from "La cuestion de la deuda: basta de versos" ["About debt: enough
bullshit!"] in <i>Comunismo</i> No.19, June 1985.
<p>17. Of course this was a purely ideological illusion based on the myth
that the system that was collapsing in the East was a social system that
was different from the one in the West! This illusion had no real economic
basis to it: since the "buyers" did not have anything to pay with, so through
what kind of magic could "effective demand" possibly increase! The closures
of companies in the East did not even allow for Western companies to take
up similar positions to the same extent, since the real income of the population
had fallen precisely because of these closures and the unemployment that
followed.
<p>18. For instance, when they issue a government bond corresponding to
$US1000, or when they issue $1000 in banknotes, and when with this paper
fiction they finance civil engineering, then, according to Keynes (who
was one of the most distinguished bourgeois economists of all time), not
only will global production grow because of these civil engineering works,
but also and even more so, because of what the workers will be able to
buy with the wages they'll receive in return for their labour. The multiplier
is the rate of increase in production compared to the initial investment.
As we can see, the capacity to develop this fiction so that it could turn
into reality, finds its limits, as all fiction does, in the development
of the contradictions of reality.
<p>19. A war of generalised destruction remains the only capitalist solution
in this situation. But in relation to the analysis that we're developing
at this stage, it would not be right to introduce this notion here as if
it were just another plain economic policy of Capital; this would mean
to impute Capital with a capacity for decision-making that it does not
really have.
<p>20. <i>"But here individuals are dealt with in so far as they are the
personifications of economic categories, embodiments of particular class-relations
and class-interests. My standpoint, from which the evolution of the economic
formation of society is viewed as a process of natural history, can less
than any other make the individual responsible for relations whose creature
he socially remains, however much he may subjectively raise himself above
them."</i>
<br>Karl Marx, Capital,
<br>Preface to the first german edition.
<p>21. If a manager really refused to bow to the dictatorship of Capital,
he would soon disappear as a capitalist and Capital would coopt someone
else to replace him (as happens frequently).
<p>22. Structures like GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) formalise
the existing <b>balance of forces</b> between various capitals, companies,
capitalist States, blocs of countries... During periods of expansion such
structures work pretty well, but during periods like the present one such
agreements are generally called into question. And, as we could see with
the famous failure of the "Uruguay Round", such conferences are never-ending
parodies that spectacularly reveal the impossibility of the various bourgeois
factions accepting the settlements that they agreed upon yesterday, because
today it would imply their own suicide. The repetition of such failures
only preludes the passage of commercial war to military war.
<p>23. It would not be right to state <b>here</b>, while analysing inter-capitalist
contradictions, that the State represents Capital in general. This of course
is true, in the face of the proletariat, in the face of its revolutionary
project; but not on the level of our analysis here when we look at how
each bourgeois State also stands in contradiction with other national States
and how -including within each Statethere exists the tendency for its decomposition
into its constituent parts, a tendency towards its own negation and towards
its restructuring into the form of other -inferior"national units". A good
example of this is what happened in former Yugoslavia!
<p>24. It is clear that such rules are a response to proletarian struggles
and that, just like all other legal formalisations, they tend to "grant"
whatever is coherent with the needs of capitalist valorisation seeking
in this way the renunciation by the proletariat of autonomous struggle.
<p>25. Keynes himself didn't mind admitting that "<b>in the long run, we're
all dead!</b>"
<p>26. In various cities of the former USSR or Romania, for example, more
than 85% of the children whose parents have had to handle nuclear missiles
during their military service are born with serious genetic defects!
<p>27. Francis Fukuyama, former advisor to the US State Department, in
his book "The end of history and the last man."
<p>28. This whole situation clearly illustrates -once again- that bourgeois
politics directed towards (against!) the proletariat and called "the struggle
for self-determination", "antiimperialist national liberation", "the struggle
for independence"... is a particularly vicious politics.
<p>29. The unilateral generalisation of the positive poles of Capital is
of course an absurdity in itself, because the essence of capitalist development
precisely contains this polarity in which the "poles" develop themselves
while imposing "under-development" everywhere else. If we take these examples
that make up the supreme ideal that all the ideologists of the regime long
for (while pretending that proletarians share such desires) it is only
to illustrate, even on such an extreme level, the full incompatibility
between the <b><u>ideal</u></b> of Capital and the needs of the human species.

The reality of the war, the sinister development of bombardments, of massacres,
of persecutions, of internments, show clearly that this war is a war against
the proletariat, against its interests and against its movement of struggle.
<p>This <b>reality of the war</b> was shown, for example, in July 1991,
in Banija (in Croatia, on the frontier with Bosnia-Herzegovina) when armed
groups, mercenaries, commandos of killers arrived in the villages and carried
out massacres. They classified the inhabitants principally according to
their Serb or Croat origins, obliging the Croats who were capable of serving
to join their ranks and to take the Serbs as hostages. Then the units fired
on all sides and the population fled. Following this the federal army invaded
the villages, beginning by bombarding them and then hunting those who had
not been able to flee. The fugitives of Croat, Hungarian and Serb origins
fled in the direction of the big towns or towards Vojvodina or Herzegovina.
<p>Little by little, these war operations grew, sometimes carried out by
the Croat militias, which caused hatred to be directed towards all those
considered to be Croats, sometimes by the Serb militias, directing hatred
towards all those considered to Serbs. For the rest of the villages it
was as if an earthquake had happened. Whereas for many years "Serbs", "Croats"
or "Hungarians" were mixed to the point where they could no longer define
themselves as belonging to one ethnic group or another, the nationalist
forces operated a systematic separation according to their supposed ethnic
links.
<p>These war operations came to be aimed more and more at the big towns.
Thus for example the industrial centre of Vukovar was bombarded for three
months by the federal army. The inhabitants spent days and nights underground
in the caves. They organised resistance, helping each other, with all nationalities
together. The Croatian National Guard and the Ustae (fascist forces) for
their part organised the internal repression. When the federal army reentered
the town, a whole series of corpses were found that had been shot from
behind, summarily executed for refusing to let themselves be enroled in
the Croatian National Guard and/or the Ustae.
<p>The general consequences of this type of operation were:
<blockquote>
<li>
<b>Indiscriminate massacres of proletarians</b>, as is shown, for example,
by the discovery of mass graves where the bodies of "Serbs", "Croats",
"Bosnians"... are mixed together.</li>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>
<b>The internment of hundreds of thousands of prisoners of war</b> in numerous
camps dispersed over the <b>whole territory</b> of former Yugoslavia.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
For example, today you find internment camps in Serbia as well as in the
parts of Bosnia occupied by the Croat militias.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
You can also find camps on the periphery of the big Slovenian towns where
the state parks "its" refugees - that Slovenia which the whole world assures
us is a successful model for the transformation taking place in Yugoslavia!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<li>
<b>The existence of floods of refugees</b> (more than 2.3 million in July
'92 based on an estimate of the UN High Commission for Refugees) who try
for better or worse to flee the massacres and throw themselves onto the
roads in the hope of finding an unlikely exile elsewhere. Meanwhile, in
Slovenia the government has declared that it will no longer accept Yugoslav
refugees; in Sweden -a social democratic paradise according to some- the
government has begun to expel refugees from Slovenia and Kosovo; in Denmark,
the government has sent back more than two hundred Serb deserters...</li>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>
<b>The forced sending to the front of war refugees...</b> there to join
their "own camp".</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<li>
Thus the press has mentioned nearly 200 Bosnian Muslim refugees in Croatia
in the Karlovac camp, who were rounded up on Monday 17 August 1992 at 4
a.m. by the Croat armed forces to be sent back to the front in Bosnia.
Some had been recently freed from Serb detention centres. All the men in
the camp aged from 18 to 60 years were forced onto a bus for Rijeka, on
the Adriatic coast, from where they would rejoin the combat positions.</li>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
Since mid-July, four thousand refugee men have been "sorted", and then
returned to the front via Rijeka and Split. The Croatian Vice-President,
Mate Granic, recognised, on Tuesday 18 August 1992, that this operation
"violated universal human rights". But he justified it by the necessity
of avoiding "a social explosion" in his country.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
Similarly in Belgrade refugees from Croatia who are over 20 years old have
been sent toward the front lines "to divert the anger of the Belgraders
who reproach them for their quiet life in Serbia".</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<li>
<b>Direct, open repression against all those who resist.</b> The state
of war, the militaristic polarisation of society, allows the liquidation
with complete impunity of all those who do not adhere to the patriotic
and ideological values that flourish in all camps. Those that stand in
the way are simply done away with!</li>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
The HCR estimates that more than a hundred thousand young deserters and
draft dodgers have fled the war and the punishment of prison which they
can receive for "high treason".</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<li>
<b>The humanitarian campaigns as a means of blackmail</b> in the hands
of the different bourgeois fractions, the better to reinforce still more
their control over the territories which they dominate, when they don't
serve directly as a means of transporting arms (<i>"in their impatience
to acquire arms, the Bosnians have without doubt already obtained satisfaction
and the Serbs of Bosnia-Herzegovina accuse some countries participating
in the humanitarian air bridge of having parachuted in arms"</i>, <i>Le
Monde</i>, 21 August 1992).</li>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<li>
<b>The material disarmament of proletarians</b> who refuse to fight on
the fronts of this war which they recognise as not being theirs and which
they flee from... The always sovereign HCR rejected the request of a Serb
deserter who affirmed his "refusal to fight the Croats who are compatriots".
In disarming the trouble-makers, in sending them back to "their" country,
the bourgeoisie delivers them tied hand and foot, like peaceful and inoffensive
lambs, to their executioners. And this is in the name of peace, in the
name of the signed accords, in the name of the UN, that proletarians will
be obliged to give up their arms and to wait passively for the hour of
their execution in the abattoirs that are the fields of battle.</li>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<li>
<b>The incessant bombardments</b> and the inquisitorial and murderous militias,
<b>the
forced mobilisations</b> and the prison camps, the refugees with their
miserable lot... <b>the shortages, the rationing, the price rises, pauperisation,
the unemployment</b> which hits a greater and greater part of the population.
The different states make use of the war situation to better liquidate
the least productive sectors and to impose new sacrifices on proletarians.</li>

<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">The social awakening</font></u></h2>
The restructuring of capital implied, in Yugoslavia as everywhere else
in
the world, a generalised attack on the conditions of life of the proletariat.
This is what determined the objective and inevitable conditions for the
rupture of social peace. In Serbia, for example, the Central Bank imposed
a 40% reduction in wages for 5 years consecutively and freed prices.
<p>In 1984, a wave of very hard-fought strikes broke out in Macedonia.
One of the most important factories of the region declared itself on strike
"against the bureaucratic mafia", another would go "to the limit". The
strikes would last 46 days.
<p>In Summer 1985, on the announcement of a diminution of wages and of
redundancies due to lack of activity, the port of Koper (the only big port
in Slovenia) was paralysed. The strikers put themselves openly on an anti-union
terrain, against class conciliation (the union had accepted the stabilisation
plan). Faced with the radicalisation of the workers, the union collaborated
with the police and the port administration in the hunt for "ringleaders".
This strike was the beginning of a vast movement of social protest which
<b>paralysed
the whole country.</b>
<p>In Slovenia, several big enterprises were paralysed by the strike, the
workers tore up and burned their union cards. In Croatia, the strikes radicalised
and the army took action to prevent the extension of the struggle. In <b>many
different regions</b>, the proletariat occupied the roads to show solidarity
with the strikers. The labourers of the ports of Split and Rijeka joined
the movement, so paralysing foreign trade. The reaction of the bourgeoisie
was rapid: the government of Slovenia authorised strikes on condition that
the workers met and discussed with the unions and informed the management
in advance.
<p>A Yugoslav journal (<i>Studensk List</i>, 3.10.85) said:
<blockquote><i>"... The information which we have reported this summer
that almost every day, in two of our enterprises, the workers were on strike...
In considering the strikes of this summer, groups of top managers (who
like to visit factories on strike) have expressed their concern at the
course of new circumstances, which were absent in preceding strikes. This
concerns particularly the fact that the labourers involved in the strikes
are expressing their general discontent, not just demands proper to their
enterprise. Concretely, the labourers who are on strike are telling the
top bosses of the Republics and the Federation that they take issue with
the way they run the country. ..."</i></blockquote>
In 1986 a new attempt by the federal government to "close unprofitable
enterprises" was launched. The unions tried to make the workers accept
this restructuration plan in "enterprise management meetings". This governmental
effort was refused <i>en bloc</i> by the working class: a new wave of strikes
inundated the country.
<p>The German newspaper <i>Die Zeit</i> of 17.1.86 reported the remarks
of a metal worker:
<blockquote><i>"I can only smile at this theory that the strike actions
were born suddenly out of some caprice or the suggestion which says that
the idler and the loner are behind the work stoppages. <b>Our patience
is at an end. The working class no longer has anything to lose or to fear.</b>"</i></blockquote>
To survive, many workers only worked three or four of the seven official
hours and turned themselves into "peasants" the rest of the time. Some
60% of the inhabitants of Yugoslavia lived off agriculture while only 38%
lived in the countryside. The others supplemented their wages by working
on the black after their jobs, 40% of family income coming from this source.
The reduction of the real wage reached impressive figures: more than 40%.
The statisticians of the Ministry of National Economy observed at this
time an important fall in the expenditures known as consumption.
<p>In March 1986, the government of Milka Planic fell. The reason? The
impossibility of effectively completing the IMF plan in the face of growing
proletarian discontent.
<p>The new government promised to freeze wages for 6 months and to increase
prices, the response was not long in coming: strikes, demonstrations, occupations,
sabotage... which changed the balance of forces. The proletariat imposed
its conditions: a proof of its strength was shown in an 8% increase in
real wages. At the same time, the strikes and sabotage translated into
a generalised loss of profitability of capital across the whole territory
of Yugoslavia.
<p>The bourgeoisie had backed down in the face of proletarian strength
but the necessities of its concrete conditions of capital accumulation
obliged it to take up ready made antagonistic solutions. It was thus that
the federal government elaborated, with the blessing of the IMF, a monetary
reform which had the aim of eliminating the non-competitive enterprises
(in withdrawing the support of the local banks), and devaluing the Dinar
so as to cause a redistribution of revenue, that is to say a radical and
relative increase of the rate of profit.
<p>In the course of the Autumn of 1986, all the banks in Macedonia, Montenegro
and Kosovo failed. The pressure from the workers was so strong that no
local manager would risk confronting the workers by closing enterprises
decreed as non-profitable. The situation deteriorated. The enterprises
were no longer able to continue functioning and they were simply abandoned.
Unemployment reached enormous levels. It is estimated that for 1986 the
number of unemployed was 1.2m, inflation reached 130%.
<p>This same year, gas and electricity were cut to more than a thousand
families in the centre of Belgrade who couldn't pay their bills.
<p>The proletariat reacted to the new austerity plan which foresaw the
elimination of 35,000 jobs by the end of the year -it launched a massive
struggle. In the countryside, agricultural proletarians armed with axes
and shovels attacked the police and the big industrial businesses.
<p>1987 and 1988 saw the protest movement radicalising -proletarians were
no longer content with just opposing the successive austerity programs,
they openly posed the question of power. The demonstrations and strikes
broke out of the limits of the factory and the big industrial centres and
called into question all aspects of life: work, "socialism", the family,
bosses, leaders, the miserable workers' housing... The elementary capitalist
conditions for a return to work did not exist, the strike was permanent.
<p>This sharpening of direct action by our class in Yugoslavia fed itself
in strength and extent on the development of a cycle of generalisation
of proletarian struggles on a world level. In the countries of Central
Europe and the East (the countries called "Communist") there developed
simultaneously a wave of intensive struggle which called into question
the social order and gave the alarm signal which brought about the politico-formal
changes which would later take place at the head of these states, so as
to better manage these "sick economies" and respond to growing social agitation.
<p>In Summer 1986, the "Hungarian" miners declared a strike against redundancies.
In Romania in 1987 several waves of struggle finished up with the mutinies
of Brasov (November 1987). In Autumn 1987, strikes also broke out in Bulgaria
-to give just one example, we can cite thaat of the Mezdra factory. In Spring
1988 in Poland, numerous strikes developed in opposition to the massive
increases in food prices and in August of the same year a wave of strikes
broke out that Walesa and Solidarnosc could only control with great difficulty.
<p>At the end of February 1987, in response to an increase in the prices
of various commodities (as much as 20% for some), a wages freeze and an
intensification of work, several strikes broke out which were described
as "wildcat" by the authorities. For a month and a half, there were some
80 strikes without warning in the whole of Yugoslavia, primarily in Croatia.
Faced with this movement, the bourgeoisie responded with the usual repressive
measures that it always uses in such circumstances: redundancies, not paying
for strike days, threats of military intervention...
<p>But at that point the movement continued to grow. After a short interruption
at the beginning of the month of April that same year, in the coal field
of Labin (Croatia), a strike developed which was the longest recorded in
Yugoslavia since the Second World War: it lasted 30 days. The miners demanded
the cancellation of all price increases, a 100% increase in wages and a
change of mine management. The bourgeoisie, faced with the perspective
of possible proletarian unity in struggle and particularly taking account
of the fact that at that very moment in the North-West of the country and
on the Adriatic coast proletarians were launching an open struggle, conceded
a nominal wage increase of more than 40% (while the workers were demanding
100% to stop the strike at Labin) and dismissed various functionaries designated
as responsible for the situation. But they could not stop the example of
the Labin miners spreading, notably to Titograd and Kraljevo.
<p>In the other regions, groups of workers met to coordinate their actions!
Proletarians in a Bosnian steelworks founded a new communist party which
was openly against "the corrupt trade union" and called for "the expropriation
of property from the state and the Party".
<p>Unfortunately, we have no more information about this attempt at centralising
the struggle. Everywhere the protests were directed against "the governmental
mafia" and the foreign banks. At the same time, more than 700 steel workers
in Slovenia began a strike "against corruption and bad management" with
a demonstration in front of the parliament of the Republic. In July in
Vukovar, 10,000 workers in a shoe and tyre company went on strike, 5,000
of them went to Belgrade to demand the doubling of their wages and the
head of the old director (at that time Minister for Foreign Trade). They
called for the dismissal of the management as well as the whole of the
town council of Vukovar.
<p>At the same time, there were demonstrations in front of the Croatian
Parliament in Zagreb. The expedition of Vukovar strikers to Belgrade (two
other struggles renewed this action around the same time) constituted some
sort of new departure in so far as it was the first time during this wave
of struggle that proletarians organised themselves practically to go beyond
regional limits. What's more, they went not only to shout out their demands
to the highest levels of the state, but above all to appeal on the spot
for unity with the workers of Belgrade. Such an action necessitates, on
the part of proletarians, an important confrontation with the Republic
by Republic containment undertaken by the unions. This initiative implied
therefore the rough outline of a rupture with the prevailing nationalism.
<p>Then the official press never spoke of strikes but only of "work stoppages"
while saying that the Belgrade government had threatened to use tanks against
the strikers in the absence of an immediate return to work.
<p>At the end of May '88, in response to a new "redistribution of revenue"
law adopted on the 15th of the month by the Federal Parliament in Belgrade
and which would have led to a fall in wages of between 20 and 45% depending
on the sector, the strike movement affected the sectors of mining and transport
(in Bosnia-Herzegovina and Serbia). More than 10,000 proletarians in struggle
demonstrated in Belgrade "against the high cost of living".
<p>In October of the same year, there were violent clashes between demonstrators
and special police units. Some workers who wanted to march on Titograd
to join in the demonstrations were stopped by the police. For two days
the town was cut off by the special units. Twelve thousand proletarians
participated in the demo. They called for "economic reform" and higher
wages. This movement led to the resignation of the government.
<p>Things went the same way in the "autonomous" province of Vojvodina where
the government went in the face of pressure from the street, specifically
threatening to bring in a State of Emergency. Finally, in December 1988,
the federal government found itself obliged to resign after two years of
open struggle against the working class.
<p>The government, after a period of political crisis and incapacity on
the part of the local bourgeoisie to control the workforce, reconstituted
itself under the aegis of Ante Markovic, a Croat, nominated Prime Minister
of the Federation. The central points of his program were the freeing of
prices, the interests of credit and the adaptation of the Dinar to the
necessities of the market (which meant its adaptation to its real value).
<p>To this the proletariat responded with a new wave of strikes during
the first months of 1989, calling once again for a 100% wage increase.
<p>Up to the month of March '89, for several weeks, Kosovo was the theatre
of more and more massive and violent struggles. All the towns of this "autonomous
province" were affected by a wave of struggles analogous to those which
had shaken Algeria a few months earlier. In this case as in the other,
the most obvious symbols and representations of the state were seen as
targets by the insurgent proletarians: police stations came under attack.
At Podujevo, the police commander ("of Albanian stock"... but this didn't
matter to the insurgents, he was still a cop!) was killed and to some extent
everywhere the forces of order came under fire from the roofs of houses,
trains were attacked, shops devastated...
<p>The state (in its federal and provincial forms) replied by decreeing,
from the first of March, a State of Emergency in the region, and, from
the 27 March, by a curfew. The day after the day when the riots reached
their paroxysm, that is to say the 28 March, the parliament of Serbia voted
unanimously for the complete suppression of the autonomy of the provinces
of Kosovo and Vojvodina, with the double aim of allowing the proletarian
revolt to be crushed more directly and of diverting it better (through
anti-Albanian and anti-Serb nationalist polarisations) and thus recuperating
discontent in Serbia itself.
<p>This explosion of anger in Kosovo, was the culminating point of a wave
of practically uninterrupted struggle which, since 1985, with its peaks
and troughs, shook all sectors and corners of Yugoslavia.
<p>In September 1989, 10,000 workers demonstrated in Belgrade and Skopje
and threatened to launch a general strike if the federal government didn't
stop inflation. The workers, who were already on strike, demanded that
the German Mark should become the principle currency which they were paid
in. The local bosses in Zagreb, Split and Rijeka for their part called,
under pressure from the strikers, for a minimum wage of 1,000 DM.
<p>In December 1989, 650,000 labourers from Serbia, Montenegro and Macedonia
declared themselves on strike against the policies of the government and
demanded an increase in wages of 100%. The enterprise bosses gave in and,
contrary to government directives, granted the demands.
<p>The multiple strikes accentuated still further the weaknesses of the
Yugoslav economy. To give an idea of the level of struggles: in 1989 the
rate of annual growth of retail prices was officially 1256%, the rate of
annual growth of wages for the same period was 1595%! Thus, in the whole
of the year 1989, real incomes increased by 25% (according to Notes &amp;
Etudes document No. 4920-r1). The analysts of this same review added: <i>"...
an evolution difficult to accept in an economy said to be 'in crisis'.
Unemployment and a significant fall in living standards are the price to
pay for stabilising the situation."</i>
<center>
<h2>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">oOo</font></h2></center>
Having enumerated the strengths of our class we must now set out the weaknesses
which characterised this wave of struggle and which became an important
lever which the state could fully exploit to impose defeat on the proletariat.
<p>Firstly, there is the non-emergence of autonomous organisations of proletarians
in struggle, and this despite the duration and intensity of the struggles
and despite the fact of a certain amount of discontent with the official
unions. But the critique of the unions was often limited to an opposition
to the "union bureaucracy", reducing the critique to the question of a
"bad leader" rather than the struggle against the counter-revolutionary
nature of trade unionism. In consequence of this weakness in the critique
of trade unionism, proletarians did not assume the tasks of self-organisation
nor the classist actions of enlarging and centralising the struggle.
<p>This weakness in the critique of institutions in terms of "bad unions",
"incompetent politicians" or of "corrupt officials" proved to be useful
to the state and more than one "individual bureaucrat" was thus thrown
to the angry workers to protect the bourgeois class and capitalist social
relations as a whole.
<p>Another factor of weakness, which certainly constitutes an explanatory
element in the first weakness which we mentioned above, was the weight
of nationalism. In effect, the movement of struggle hadn't markedly broken
with nationalist containment, even during the riots in Kosovo in 1989.
In the context of Yugoslavia, where the national question is the weapon
<i>par
excellence</i> with which the state confronts the proletariat, every qualitative
development has to immediately and absolutely set itself the task of an
effective, conscious, break which takes on the forces of nationalist containment.
If proletarian solidarity beyond the frontiers of the different republics
found many an occasion for expressing itself in the course of hundreds
of strikes and demonstrations, this solidarity never transformed itself
into concerted, organised actions against the various nationalist forces!
We therefore have to be prudent in using terms like "unitary" or "showing
solidarity". The reality of the existence of numerous simultaneous strikes
over several years is a fact. Nevertheless, the immediate expression of
the unity of struggle and of perspective, beyond local solidarity, did
not express itself in a consequent manner in terms of organisation and
centralisation. Even in Kosovo, where proletarians took to the streets
with arms to violently attack their misery, any potential for extension
was castrated by the state which was very easily able to reduce the riots
to a purely "Albanian" affair.

<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">Economic, political and social reforms</font></u></h2>
If the wave of struggles in the '80s constituted the classist response
of the proletariat to the intensification of attacks that it had suffered
since the start of the '80s, the bourgeois class also didn't remain inactive
and confronted the new situation of crisis by a whole series of draconian
measures on the economic, social and political planes.
<p>The economic crisis only declared itself openly in Yugoslavia in 1979.
Until then, the specific mechanisms of "centralised planning" of the countries
of the Russian bloc as well as the particularities of "self-management
socialism" of Yugoslavia, allowed the Yugoslav economy to adapt itself
to the consequences of the world crisis. But it is clear that the various
factors (protectionism, centralised regulation) which can allow, and really
have allowed, the effects of the world crisis of capital to be kept at
bay in this region, can only <b>delay</b> an even more violent outbreak
of the same capitalist contradictions later on. This is why, for revolutionary
communism, "self-management" and "economic planning" are just illusions.
They are myths which aim in the first place at drawing workers towards
acceptance of their condition within bourgeois society and which <b>in
reality</b>, beyond these pretensions and beyond the short-term variations
in the forms that cover up exploitation, bring proletarians nothing but
capitalist misery, with always more exploitation and war.
<p>From the start of the '80s in Yugoslavia, the growth curves turned upside
down, unemployment developed, foreign debt exploded, inflation ran away
(until it attained a record rate of 2685% per year, in other words prices
doubled every month!). At the start of the '80s, the first shortages of
basic necessities also appeared: power cuts, petrol shortages...
<blockquote><i>"The fall in the standard of living was so great that it's
hard to imagine another country which wouldn't have reacted to this situation
by radical political changes or even by a revolution."</i> (H. Lydall,
Yugoslavia in Crisis - 1989, cited by Paul Garde in Vie et mort de la Yougoslavie.)</blockquote>
During the whole of this period, the Yugoslav government tried to "accommodate"
to the crisis situation, with austerity measures and programs of economic
stabilisation, all under the aegis of the International Monetary Fund which
was very attentive to the interests of capital invested in Yugoslavia.
<p>But, as we have said already, from 1985 these measures provoked a massive
response on the part of the proletariat which only added to the difficulties
of the economic situation.
<p>Among the later reforms, we can mention those of December 1989, introduced
after new falls in the volume of Yugoslav industrial production, after
a new increase in unemployment, the growth of shortages, inflation... and
an "explosion" of wages following struggles. This new reform bore the marks
of the crisis which would violently shake Yugoslavia less than a year later.
While introducing these reforms to attack the proletariat head on, the
Federal State affirmed at the same time its ascendancy over the constitutive
republics of Yugoslavia. The new federal Prime Minister, Markovic, introduced
a plan which foresaw the complete freezing of wages and a partial freezing
of prices, the creation of a "new Dinar" (convertible and tied to the German
Mark), a restrictive monetary policy (limitation of credit) and a new fiscal
policy (big cuts in wages, increases in the budget of the central state).
It is clear from these reforms that the state was looking for a way to
stabilise the economy, in other words to reduce the part of value dedicated
to wages and to impose increases in productivity by eliminating (by suppressing
the various mechanisms of protection which share out the effects of international
competition amongst all the enterprises, or, as Markovic said "to help
the enterprises which give the best results and allowing the bad ones to
take on the consequences of their lack of ability") the deficient enterprises
(deficient in the sense that they were incapable of lastingly overturning
the status quo in the opposition between the interests of the enterprise
and the interests of proletarians). The federal government foresaw that
150,000 more people would find themselves without work after only a year
of application of the new measures. At the same time, the official economic
indicators already showed a fall of real wage income of 9% for the month
of December 1989 and of 29% for the month of January 1990.
<p>By these new reforms the Federal State affirmed its pretensions to dominate
political and economic life in the various republics, together with its
concern to control the social situation. This "centralist" solution (that
we could also call "Serb" (1) in that it corresponds directly and for historical
reasons to the interests of the bourgeoisie of that republic) already had
the support of important sectors of Yugoslav society, for example within
the army, within the various republics, including Slovenia and Croatia,
but also internationally. But inevitably they noted that these draconian
measures aimed at containing the antagonisms shaking Yugoslav society would
be too late to enable the Federal State to survive. If under the effect
of the crisis the bourgeois fractions of the various republics more and
more saw their salvation in the affirmation of their independence in the
face of the pretensions of the Federal State to suppress their sovereignty,
it is above all by international intervention and notably by the imperialist
policies of the Western powers that this "centralist option" became obsolete
and that the usual game of nationalist confrontation in Yugoslavia set
out on the path of armed conflict.
<p>If it is clear that this question of the "autonomous republics" of Yugoslavia
constitutes an ideological force of prime importance against the proletariat,
we must make it clear, at this precise point in our analysis, that it coincides
also and in part with the economic interests of such or such republic in
particular and to the corresponding fraction of the bourgeoisie. Far from
wanting to analyse their particularities as "particularisms" needed to
lead proletarians on the basis of "specific tasks" as the extreme left
of the bourgeoisie often advocate (as they're always looking for popularity
and something to agitate about) we analyse them with the aim of throwing
light on the complementarity and convergence of interests of the different
fractions of the bourgeoisie faced with the necessities of confronting
an internationalist proletariat which has no regional or national interests
to defend.
<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">The premises of the war</font></u></h2>
It is in this immediate context that the outbreak of war in Yugoslavia
was produced. There are two essential elements of explanation. Firstly,
there is just the situation of struggle, the lack of adherence of proletarians
to the national economy, to the interests of the Yugoslav nation. It would
be wrong to only want to see here the various struggles that we have already
briefly mentioned.
<p>It was above all this lack of adherence of proletarians to the national
interest which had caused the capitalist state (in its various regional
expressions, Croatian, Slovenian, Serbian, Bosnian...) to not step back
from putting into place much more radical policies for the defence of its
interests. These were draconian "crisis" reforms, "democratisation" (we
use here the flag used by the bourgeoisie in its campaigns, to refer to
the <b>reinforcing</b> of atomisation, of everyone for himself, of mortal
competition between proletarians, of the reign of citizenisation and terror,
briefly, to an advancing disintegration of the proletariat, to the <b>reinforcing</b>
of the democratic terror proper to the generalised dictatorship of commodities)
and nationalism, war (conscription, requisitioning, imprisonment and killing
of those who resist, militarisation of the whole of society...). <b>The
Yugoslav nation revealed itself to be no longer adequate as a framework
for effectively dealing with the proletariat in these regions. The unleashing
of inter-imperialist war in this area allowed the world capitalist state
to drown the class antagonisms which were tearing its society apart in
generalised massacres in which proletarians killed each other, and thus
to set out on a path offering a bourgeois solution to the crisis of over-production
of value.</b>
<p>The second element is also paramount and is directly linked to the first
in so far as it cannot escape from the historical context which it is a
product of, but it is really subordinate to it. This is the exacerbated
competition between the different bourgeois fractions who abandon themselves
to a war without mercy <b>so as not to be among the losers</b> in the competition
which opposes them in the world market (the universal law of value which
punishes capitals in the non-profitable sectors by purely and simply devalorising
them). Inter-bourgeois antagonisms always fall into second place in the
face of the revolutionary appearance of the proletariat, in other words
the different fractions of the bourgeoisie <b>always</b> start - on pain
of being eliminated - to make an abstraction of their particular interests
and to realise their common circumstances when faced with communism and
their need to defend their supreme interest: safeguarding their world of
money, wage-labour and commodities.
<p>It is this exacerbation of conflicts of interest between the numerous
bourgeois fractions and capitalist entities directly on the international
level, where these antagonisms express themselves by the support of different
powers for such and such a fraction existing on the territory of Yugoslavia
and the Balkans, coupled with the general situation of lack of adherence
of proletarians to the national economy, which was the basic cause of the
inter-imperialist conflagration in Yugoslavia. We want to make it clear
at this point (we will return to this later on) that <b>the "military"
phase of the explosion in Yugoslavia was directly approved and encouraged
by the process of international recognition of independence of Slovenia
and Croatia, and that therefore the orchestration of the war and of massacres
between proletarians is not simply an expression of an internal Yugoslav
crisis but corresponds to the direction given to this crisis by the Western
imperialist powers.</b> The situation can only be understood in relation
to all the other countries of the region, including the West.
<p>In Serbia, following the <i>de facto</i> dismemberment of the old Yugoslav
Federation, the "Federal Republic of Yugoslavia", presented itself as the
only inheritor of ex-Yugoslavia, proclaiming itself with Montenegro on
27 April 1992. In this republic, whose international isolation is growing,
the situation is extremely tense: refugees flood in everywhere, huge numbers
of young men have left the country to avoid conscription, the economy (2)
has been transformed into an economy of day to day survival (a third of
the economically active population is unemployed), misery and discontent
reign.
<p>The austerity measures put in place on 30 June 1992 in order to alleviate
the effects of the international embargo foresaw amongst other things the
partial freezing of prices "preceded by an increase of 116% in the price
of petrol and 76% for electricity" (<i>Le Monde</i>, 2.7.92). This austerity
plan aimed principally to "contain the discontent which threatened to turn
into a social revolt" (idem). And in its propaganda the government habitually
used the international blockade as a mobilising theme to forge national
unity in the face of "the enemies of Serbia without" and to denounce and
repress those who are "the enemy within".
<p>The Serbian opposition tried to strengthen itself by recuperating the
growing discontent of proletarians in general and the refusal of the war
in particular by organising pacifist mobilisations from the beginning of
the year. Starting in December '91, they called for elections so as to
get rid of Miloevic, designated as responsible and a suitable whipping
boy. But there was nothing to choose between these "opponents" and the
bourgeois already in place and nothing to "differentiate" them, not even
the slightest nuance. What's more, they were themselves the "old" political
friends of Miloevic and only "divergent" by the need to present a credible
"alternative". It didn't work and no bourgeois fraction is really credible:
the last legislative elections, in the Spring of 1992, were marked by an
abstention rate of more than 50%!
<p>Faced with proletarian mobilisation, many opposition groups organised
a demonstration in Belgrade on 9 March, 1991. It was in response to the
first armed skirmishes between Serb and Croat forces in the town of Pakrac
(in Slavonia, North Eastern Croatia) and thus they objectively participated
in nationalist recruitment. But the demo didn't work out as expected, it
overflowed its initial aims and transformed itself into class confrontations
with the forces of order (proving that the proletariat, despite the power
of nationalism, was still not beaten and that it continued against the
current to defend its interests). The demonstration started to move through
the suburbs of Belgrade (with the nationalists who were in competition
with Miloevic, those of the Serbian Renewal Movement, at its head). But
more and more it was joined by workers who had waited months for their
wages to be paid, then the students, then the schoolkids and the unemployed.
They shouted: "Give us freedom, give us bread" or even "Miloevic = Saddam,
send him to the desert". When the demo reached the centre of Belgrade it
was 100,000 strong. The police tried to stop the protest and to chase after
the demonstrators who were armed with clubs and stones. A plain clothes
policeman was killed. It is then that the demo led itself towards Republic
Square, passing through the centre - on the way the banks and shops were
attacked repeatedly in a very rapid fashion. Yugoslav and Serbian national
flags were burned. Proletarians attacked the police armoured cars, the
street fighting went on for hours, police cars were burnt and everywhere
barricades went up. The police killed a demonstrator. In the evening the
army had to intervene, 100 armoured cars crossed the town and occupied
strategic points. The protest lasted four days until the army left. After
this riot, the opposition parties pursued their negotiations with Miloevic
and they decided together on a common policy of national unity.
<h3>
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">THE SACRED UNION WOULD BE SEALED IN PROLETARIAN
BLOOD !</font></b></h3>
There was massive refusal of conscription and a great number of desertions.
In December '91, after numerous "victories" for the federal army, the "Croats"
were achieving their first important successes in 5 months of war, which
also signified that the federal army was more and more disintegrating.
<p>Only 15% of conscripts responded to the call for mobilisation during
Autumn '91: the refusal to turn up for military service was widespread
and in order to counter this absenteeism it is now forbidden for any liable
man aged under 30 to leave the republic without permission. In this situation,
the state decided to extend, by decree in December '91, by three months
the duration of military service for the recruits of '91 for "an indeterminate
time, according to the needs [for cannon fodder!] of the Yugoslav Army"
and fixing at 4 months the duration of mobilisation of army reservists.
Military service was for 12 months and the reservists were mobilised beforehand
between 45 and 60 days. These measures aimed to bring under control the
problems of recruitment, the army admitted that more than 10,000 reservists
had refused to join their units.
<p>Repression against the deserters, and all those who struggled openly
against the war and organised themselves accordingly, was put in place.
The federal military authorities threatened the draft dodgers and deserters
with long prison sentences according to Article 121 which set out penalties
from a three years in prison minimum to the death penalty if the deserter
left the country. Other deserters who hid after publicly refusing to be
mobilised were grabbed off the street, imprisoned for 2 or 3 days, and
the sent to the front to clear mine fields with the aim of killing or mutilating
them! Numerous unidentified bodies were thus regularly buried at the front
without anybody being able to tell where they came from, although this
could also be the work of the death squads operating in Croatia who tracked
down the deserters and opponents of the war and dumped the bodies of the
anti-patriots they had assassinated at the front.
<p>All over Serbia and Vojvodina young reservists hid themselves to avoid
being conscripted: 25,000 "Hungarians" left the country to avoid conscription,
more than 100,000 men did the same across the whole of Serbia. Everywhere
young men of conscription age have chosen exile.
<p>From this movement against the war an opposition emerged which organised
itself OUTSIDE the official "opposition" parties, but, alas, nowhere near
enough AGAINST them. Women proletarians played an important role in these
struggles. Not being mobilised for the various fronts, they were the ones
who were going to organise opposition to the war. It was also they who
snatched their sons from obligatory conscription, who organised numerous
groups circulating information about movements of desertion, who took charge
of the legal defence of those who refused to fight. It was also they who
took on "psychological aid" for soldiers who returned traumatised from
the front. When the first regiments returned from combat in Slovenia (and
the massacres that had happened afterwards in Croatia then in Bosnia) some
talked about the Vietnam syndrome. Since then, for sure, the situation
has deteriorated: "crazy acts" and suicides have multiplied. Some doctors
saw nothing wrong with sending six soldiers with serious mental problems
back to the front within 48 hours, after having threatened them with "punishment"
if they continued their "irresponsible" behaviour.
<p>But the refusal to go to war was far from just being individual, collective
protests became more and more numerous without actually taking on the form
of a declared resistance, of a clearly organised movement. Hardly a week
passed without conscripts collectively resisting orders. The biggest refusal
took place at Kragujevac, a garrison town in central Serbia, when 7,000
reservists presented themselves at the call up without their arms. They
shut themselves up in their camps and refused to move. The military authorities
exempted ALL OF THEM, but distributed to local employers an "infamy list"
of all the "traitors to the country" who will find themselves forbidden
to sell their labour power. In November 1991, 200 reservists stood in front
of the office of the district president in Valjevo until their commander
signed their military books stipulating that they had completed their service.
<b>On
18 December, at Markuica, on the front in Slavonia, 700 reservists refused
to continue to fight after having already done their 45 days of recall.
A general ordered the arrest of their officers, but backed down when the
troops prepared to shoot him.</b> At the beginning of January 1992, 150
reservists deserted as a group from the front at Osijek after spending
more than a month on the front line and returned to Belgrade to protest
at their conditions of life. In March 1992, more than 700 reservists on
leave at Gornji Milanovac revolted and refused to return to the front in
Eastern Slavonia, denouncing "the incompetence of the officer corps of
the army and the unreliability of information coming from the front". At
the same time 4 reserve officers were arrested in Belgrade after having
abandoned the front and two others were sentenced to imprisonment in Ni,
while thousands of reserve soldiers had to be brought before courts martial.
<p>All these desertions and refusals to go to war, however contradictory
these actions may have been (pacifism and the lack of perspectives for
going beyond the immediate situation are the most marked weaknesses!),
are nevertheless a clear proof that the national cohesion is not as strong
as the bourgeois killers in each camp had hoped and that the proletariat
is certainly not ready to leave for the front "with joy and gladness".
<p>At the same time as the refusal of war on the military front, other
manifestations of proletarian combativity burst out on the production front:
strikes broke out in the course of which proletarians began to organise
themselves, by force of circumstances, into "autonomous" structures. In
the universities as well new opposition movements were born (we do not
have any more information about this at present).
<p>Before the outbreak of war in Bosnia-Herzegovina, 100,000 people took
to the streets in Sarajevo to protest against the war. In February 1992,
important street fights took place between the federal army and the inhabitants
of several towns in this republic. On 29 February 1992, under pressure
from the EEC and the USA, Bosnia-Herzegovina organised a referendum for
independence. On the same day barricades were constructed inside the town
of Sarajevo by masked elements of the extremist militias of Serbia and
Croatia. Armed confrontations took place in front of the barricades, 30,000
demonstrators demanded the removal of these "ethnic" barricades dividing
their neighbourhoods.
<p>At the beginning of April 1992, two big demos took place in Sarajevo.
A hundred thousand people from Sarajevo and other towns in the area demonstrated
against the war and for the dissolution of all the nationalist parties!
Marksmen fired on the demonstrators, there were many deaths. The next day,
100,000 people again took to the streets and again marksmen fired on them.
Following this, Sarajevo was completely cut off from the outside world.
The town is subjected to permanent bombardment from outside. During this
time in Sarajevo people organised themselves and defended their homes together.
They barricaded the streets against the armoured cars and attacked them.
The irregular soldiers fired on everything which moved.

<font face="Comic Sans MS">oOo</font></h2></center>
We have set out here a certain amount of information about the resistance
of proletarians to the war, but we must insist on the weaknesses of these
struggles and, in the immediate context of the war, it seems evident that
the proletariat there has been subjected to an important defeat. One of
the reasons for the unleashing of the war was precisely the need for the
state in Yugoslavia to crush the proletariat, to subjugate it, to defeat
its struggles and disperse it. As we have indicated, the framework of the
old Yugoslav nation could no longer fulfil this role effectively and its
break-up was the price to pay for domesticating the proletariat. Today
no one can deny that systematic massacres, bombardment, destruction and
repression, rapes, brain-washing by propaganda... briefly, <b>the unleashing
of state terror</b> has cut deep into proletarian combativity.
<p>As this war progresses and extends itself, relayed by a warlike and
nationalist propaganda, and as the bombardments become more selective and
as the repression targets its victims more and more "ethnically", we can
see a more active participation by various strata of the population in
war operations. The imperialist war therefore took the form of a "popular
war" as the proletariat submitted to nationalist recruitment and dissolved
itself into the people to enrol in the various nationalist fronts.
<p>This evolution also took on the structure of the armed forces and the
system of defence which the Yugoslav state had adopted (with all the military
equipment, armaments, stocks, munitions and logistic support distributed
over the whole territory) which is even favoured by nature because of the
mountainous terrain with numerous villages with strong communitarian traditions
implanted over the whole of this republic.
<p>This reality also makes the situation more inextricable for any external
intervention. Thus the declaration of General Barry McCaffrey, Assistant
Chief of the Joint Forces Command of the US Army who estimated that it
would take the United Nations 400,000 men and one year to bring an end
to the violence in ex-Yugoslavia, without any guarantee that hostilities
wouldn't commence as soon as the foreign soldiers left.
<p>We are forced to admit that our class has suffered a severe defeat in
Yugoslavia (and we are not referring just to sectors of the proletariat
in Yugoslavia, but also just as much to other sectors outside the borders
of Yugoslavia who are rendered accomplices of the state killers by their
passivity!) and that many proletarians have deserted from class combat
to join one of the imperialist camps present there. Lack of information
does not permit us to pronounce on the strength of proletarians who continue
to resist the war, the nationalist campaigns and the democratic propaganda
so as to safeguard by their efforts internationalist classist perspectives.
We know by experience that such nuclei can exist, resisting, surviving
in such conditions of war. In this movement, these comrades crystallise
the innate tendency of the proletariat to transform the imperialist war
into a revolutionary war for communism.
<p>In an international context of world crisis such as we are subjected
to today, the exacerbation of antagonisms between the capitalist sharks
is inevitable, and the aggravation of inter-imperialist tensions, the multiplication
of war zones on the "natural" terrain where these antagonisms burst out
openly (3), and this independently of the will of the various bourgeois
fractions, constitutes our day to day reality. But the war is also <b>here
and now</b>, and not just somewhere else or later on. The various capitalist
fractions confront each other permanently and make war so as to conquer
each others markets. While confrontation glides on the financial terrain,
on the military terrain it does not change its nature, it is always a question
of the same economic war indispensable to the survival of the system. Social
peace must reign, whatever the price, productivity must be preserved. If
this cannot be obtained by reforms and other austerity measures against
our conditions of life and struggle, it will have to be obtained by force
of arms (4).
<p>We must not deceive ourselves - this war in Yugoslavia constitutes another
step towards generalised war. In effect it is taking place in front of
the eyes of the proletarians of Europe and elsewhere who smugly watch,
in the successive and interminable episodes of this war on their little
screens, a banalisation, a naturalisation of war. This is then conceived
as the "normal" way out for any society in crisis. And the crisis is "natural"
and "normal" as well, as are poverty, unemployment and the sacrifices that
follow. What's more, without any question of objecting, you accept, you
shrug your shoulders ("it's not so bad here", "what's the use in complaining?"),
you bend your back and soon you will be ready to leave for the front...
<p>This should be no surprise since the majority of proletarians across
the world, and particularly in Europe, are imprisoned by patriotic walls
and bourgeois ideology, they are prisoners of pacifism, of "anti"-imperialism
or even still of "anti"-fascism and the international proletariat is not
in a position today to affirm its revolutionary being as bearer of its
own communist project.
<p>As long as we remain passive consumers and spectators of our miserable
lives, as long as we remain "useful idiots" for Capital, anything can be
done to us and we should not be surprised if tomorrow good citizens start
to kill each other for one reason or another!! Neighbour against neighbour,
workmate against workmate, proletarian against proletarian.

If we have emphasised here various aspects of the war in ex-Yugoslavia,
it is certainly not for us to give ourselves up to lamentation over this
state of affairs, nor to try to make people feel moved by all this suffering!
Against humanism, against hypocritical lamentations, we want to shout out
that the struggle against capitalist war can only become real if it is
taken up <b>here and now</b>, from today, attacking all fractions of the
bourgeoisie, denouncing all their ideologies and refusing any front with
any radical bourgeois fraction under the pretext of immediate common interests.
<p>The proletariat is against all the camps, against the Croat, Serb, Bosnian,
Slovenian and Kosovar camps, against the "international community" which
has never been anything other than a name for a gang of terrorist states
which subjugate and exploit us day after day! The French, American, Russian,
German, Italian, British, Egyptian, Iranian state... whichever they may
be! We have no country! To be a patriot, is to murder our class brothers
and sisters. To be a patriot is to be an assassin!
<p>Our class solidarity with our brothers and sisters who struggle in ex-Yugoslavia
is expressed first of all when we attack the bourgeois fraction that directly
confronts us because in the struggle against "our own bourgeoisie" we <b>practically</b>
affirm our internationalism, our identity of interest and struggle with
proletarians in ex-Yugoslavia and elsewhere. Our internationalism doesn't
consist in "doing something here for proletarians over there". Our internationalism
is to be in the same fight, affirming there the community of interests
and struggle which unites us with our class brothers and sisters. Fighting
against "our own bourgeoisie" - this is the profound expression of our
class solidarity, of our growing unity. It is the passivity which reigns
here in the face of austerity measures dealt to us which permits the development
of the war in ex-Yugoslavia.
<p>The importance of this last point becomes all the more evident when
we consider the practical connivance (despite all the declarations of intent)
uniting all the fractions of the world capitalist state, whose different
policies all <b>objectively</b> end up in the generalised massacre of our
class brothers and sisters. The involvement of the imperialist powers in
this war could not be clearer: together all fractions of the bourgeoisie
concur in the pursuit of massacres. Apart from their role in the unleashing
of the conflict by their consecration of the break up of Yugoslavia (recognition
of the independence of Slovenia by Germany on 23/12/91 and of Croatia and
Slovenia by the EC on 15/1/92); apart from the gigantic profits which they
have made, as in every war, from arms sales; apart from the use of this
war as a field of experimentation; apart from the hypocritical international
embargo which primarily acts to encourage national unity in Serbia; apart
from the useful propaganda which the war allows them to develop "at home",
"in defence of the values of the free world", against "human folly" (a
pole of repulsion horrifyingly waved under the noses of proletarians "elsewhere"),
the war in ex-Yugoslavia plays, as we have seen above, the role of a terrifying
Bogeyman: "What are you complaining about? Be content with what you have,
otherwise..." and the austerity measures can be piled on without meeting
any resistance. To intervene on the territory, France, Germany, Belgium,
Russia, the USA, the NGOs, the UN... cheerfully play the "peace keeping"
card. Because, as always, it is in the name of defending civilisation against
barbarism, in the name of keeping the peace that slaughter is perpetuated.
The more they talk to us about peace, the more war rages!
<p>The humanitarian campaigns operate on the terrain of direct repression
of the proletariat. In Bosnia-Herzegovina it is in the name of peace, in
the name of signed accords, in the name of the UN, that they have forced
proletarians to hand over their arms and to wait passively, like beasts,
for the hour of their slaughter in the abattoirs that are the fields of
battle. The same scenario has been put into place in Iraq.
<p>The humanitarian business directly favours the war. Not only does "humanitarian
aid" give a good alibi to the imperialist powers to intervene in a country
(Somalia, Rwanda etc.), not only does it directly serve the "ethnic cleansing"
operations in the territories (deportation of proletarians to other areas
and camps), but on top of this, the "humanitarian aid convoys" allow the
fighters of the various warring imperialist fractions to be fed while an
international blockade -another specifically modern form of intervention-
only attacks the living conditions of proletarians by depriving them of
essential commodities and making all goods on the local market more expensive!
<p>The peace plans are nothing but the consecration by the "international
community" of what is happening on the ground. What is happening on the
ground is deportations, malnutrition and famine, epidemics... briefly,
everything that follows from the unleashing of state terror.
<p>We do not fight for "peace", we are not pacifists! Peace is only a particular
moment of war. We do not want a capitalism purged of its "defects", of
its "bad side", of its wars, its famines, its poverty. We do not fight
for the amelioration of this world. We fight for its complete destruction,
its total annihilation!
<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">Communist action against capitalist war and
peace !</font></u></h2>
Those who today refuse sacrifices, social peace, the defence of the national
interest... the draft dodgers, the rebels, the troublemakers... are repressed,
locked up and shot by the state. This is exactly what is happening on a
large scale in ex-Yugoslavia, in all its ex-republics: open and direct
repression against the resisters. The state of war, the militarist polarisation
of society, allows the liquidation with impunity of all those who do not
go along with the values (patriotic, religious or whatever) brandished
by each side. People who are a nuisance are simply suppressed by the state.
<p>The bourgeois state persecutes all those that it denounces as "troublemakers",
"agents of the enemy", that is to say all those who oppose themselves to
it, to its social peace and its Sacred Union. The maintenance of its domination
over society requires only the weakness of the proletariat and rests essentially
on the capacity of the state to divide proletarians, to keep them imprisoned
in bourgeois polarisations (which is where ideological mystifications are
important), and to repress without mercy any manifestation of struggle
against exploitation, in other words it's very essence. This war is not
a war of Serbs against Croats, of Croats against Muslims etc. It is the
war of one class against another, it is the war of the bourgeoisie which
wants to crush its mortal enemy which is neither Serb nor Croat nor Muslim
but international, the world proletariat.
<p>Proletarians of all lands, unite! Rich in the historic experience of
our class, we reappropriate our collective memory of struggle. Our fight
carries real perspectives of life, we want to destroy forever non-life,
misery, exploitation, war!
<p>Against the sectarianism and the mistrust towards any attempt at organising
militancy, towards any attempt to bring to life a centralised direction
for revolutionary activity, we denounce the nationalists, the UN and other
imperialist powers, we spread information, support internationalist comrades,
clarify and take on the objectives and the means of communist struggle.
<p>The publication and distribution in different languages of this text
constitutes an attempt at centralising our activities, at entering into
contact with other revolutionaries, at consolidating the camp of those
who defend internationalist perspectives, at expressing the needs of proletarians
who revolt against war and misery, and to reinforce, by the clarity of
our perspectives of struggle and by our determination, the impact of our
refusal.

<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">Notes</font></u></h3>
1. We must not confuse this centralist "Serbian option" with the "Greater
Serbia" option. This latter option was taken up as flavour of the month
and popularised by the Serbian bourgeoisie only after the obsoleteness
of the centralist "Serbian option" showed itself to be irreversible. The
"Greater Serbia" policy is therefore more a consequence of the outbreak
of war (the "Serbian" response to the international recognition of Slovenia
and Croatia) and not at all the cause of this war as the media would have
us believe.
<p>2. We can judge the situation by these eloquent figures, which express
the tragic reality which our class is subjected to today behind their cold
calculation. In mid-June 1993, the Dinar was devalued (in fact its rate
of exchange was aligned with the black market): from 1DM for 68,000 Dinars
to 1DM for 700,000 (!) Dinars, more than ten times, without wages increasing
in the same proportion. In mid-August, the National Bank, incapable of
printing enough money to fill the gap and to appear to pay the meagre wages
of the proletarians still working, issued a new note for... 500 million
Dinar. A junkie like this soon needs more drugs, he injects a new, bigger
dose scarcely 15 days later: a new note for... 1 billion Dinar is issued.
Finally, three weeks later, it is a note for... 10 billion Dinar which
must be printed as quickly as possible. If the price rises paid by proletarians
during the first 8 months of 1993 carry on at the same rate, the experts
(!?) foresee an annual inflation rate of... 1,671,000,000%. To carry on
the anecdote, each hour the Dinar loses 1% of its value relative to the
DM. The waltz of the price labels became hallucinatory, the prices are
posted up today in billions of Dinar while in 1992 inflation was "only"
20,000%. At the beginning of September 1993, bread, milk and other foodstuffs
"of primary necessity" are rationed in almost all the towns of Serbia and
Montenegro. Anyway, basic products have disappeared from the shops whose
windows are virtually empty. People die in the hospitals for lack of adequate
medicines. The bourgeoisie have to admit that, according to their norms,
"90% of the population live below the poverty threshold". The most effected
are the retired who it is no longer rare to see competing with stray cats
and dogs for the contents of dustbins. This is the situation which the
proletariat is reduced to, with the ease with which the bourgeoisie can
impose it by force in a period of war! Miloevic wasn't joking when he
said that the sanctions and the blockade offered to Serbia "the occasion
for restructuring its economy"!
<p>3. Without giving an exhaustive list we can cite Rwanda, Somalia, numerous
ex-Soviet republics, Turkey, Iraq, Lebanon, North Korea, Yemen (North and
South), Haiti, Burma, India, Tibet, Mozambique, Angola, Algeria, Indonesia,
Liberia etc. etc.
<p>4. The path to armed conflict is only another form of the permanent
competition that takes place without mercy between the capitalists and
of the struggle which they simultaneously wage against the proletariat.

In the Serb bastion of Banja Luka (North Western Bosnia) three elite units,
the First Army Corp of Krajina, the 16th Motorised Unit and the First Armoured
Brigade, launched a mutiny on their return to the front on 10 September.
The "Serbian" - in such a moment of confrontation nationality is dissolved!
- mutineers entered the town with their arrmoured cars and took control
of the main official buildings, notably the local radio and TV stations,
the town hall and the Head Quarters of the army! The rebels immediately
gave themselves a leadership, an "emergency general staff", baptised "September
93", led by non-commissioned officers and subalterns. At its head could
be found a corporal!
<p>Their demands were: an increase in their <i>"miserable pay"</i> (the
equivalent of 1 Dollar per month for the ordinary soldiers), the arrest
of <i>"war profiteers, who instead of being on watch in the trenches are
getting rich with the blessing of those in power, leading an easy life
at the rear, sometimes in fashionable circles"</i>. A "black list" of 700
of these "profiteers" was drawn up and arrests began. That same evening
the mayor of the town had the honour of opening the dank dungeons. For
a month before the soldiers, nothing more than proletarians regimented
in the uniform of the fatherland, had denounced their conditions of non-existence
and threatened repeatedly to <b><i>"turn their rifles on those in the rear!"</i></b>,
in their own words. With each period of leave they feared returning to
find their families reduced to desperation. A desperation which even their
own death could not erase. The payment lavished on their families by the
state wasn't even enough to cover the costs of burial!
<p>This movement revealed the profound social fractures which developed
as the war dragged on. Here, it is clear that the union sacr&eacute;e was
BLOWN APART. All the "appeals for calm and reason" were in vain. From that
moment the bourgeoisie imposed a prudent silence which said much about
their fears of stoking the fires of class struggle. The bourgeois had to
recognise <i>"their obsession with seeing the awakening of Serb-Serb conflicts
the like of which had never been seen throughout history"</i>. Behind this
journalistic verbiage in Le Monde the bourgeoisie tried to hide the spectre
which haunts them, their terror at seeing proletarians taking up their
real arms, class against class, against this nightmare.
<p>In fact the mutineers took the town into their hands with the support
of other proletarians. They were the formal and focused expression of a
profound movement of discontent. In the town the situation was "calm",
no more shots rang out in the night. That is to say that the state did
not dare or no longer had the means to send "reliable" troops to put down
the rebellion. The "Rambos" on duty who always appeared on the front pages
of the newspapers disappeared from the boulevards, swept away by the mutiny.
For the first time in several months Banja Luka had an uninterrupted electricity
supply. The insurgents seized the power stations and began to provide for
the region which they controlled. Against all the sacrifices imposed by
the bourgeois and their war economy the proletarian defeatists of Banja
Luka IMPOSED IN THEIR ACTS AND BY FORCE the immediate satisfaction of our
basic needs!
<p>Very quickly, on the announcement of the mutiny in Banja Luka, numerous
proletarians in various brigades of the Bosnian Serb army sent telegrams
of solidarity. Thanks to this support the mutineers <b>declared</b> that
they wanted to take control of ALL these units. Alas, it is not with fine
phrases that you generalise a movement: declarations and telegrams of solidarity
are not enough. Behind the words are the acts which matter. If the proletariat
wants to definitively rid itself of the butchery which has massacred it
for more than two years in the region the one and only solution is the
GENERALISATION in acts of revolutionary defeatism. We must finish with
"Serbs", "Croats", "Muslims" and other categories with which Capital tries
to crush us. The development of struggle has its own requirements: it must
break social cohesion not only in the units of the army but in the whole
of society. For this it needs to finish once and for all with nationalism
in affirming loud and clear that proletarians have no interest in this
war, nor in this dying world. We call for ONLY ONE WAR, that which is against
our exploiters, whether they are Serbs, Croats, Muslims or whatever. Against
them there should be no mercy. To show any would be a sign of weakness.
<p>Improving our conditions of life -and even GOING BEYOND them- can only
be imposed by a generalisation of the balance of forces that the mutineers
of Banja Luka were only able to establish in too local a fashion. In fact
generalisation means directly attacking and destroying everything which
represents the State. Proletarians from various units solidarising with
the mutineers contented themselves with declarations of intent when the
situation DEMANDED something else: not only PASSING openly into the camp
of insurrection but also ACCELERATING this by a radicalisation of demands
and globalising them to put an end to the butchery. The situation called
for the arrest of their own officers, for the use of their arms to attack
the State etc...
<p>Words have never made any difference to our misery!!!
<p>The situation now is characterised by a state of general weakness of
our class across all the struggles going on in the world. There is a lack
of continuity, of liaison and of extension. Wherever struggles break out,
some strikes, some riots in separate places, and Capital manages to maintain
this separation, there, as it happens, is where the community of misery
and struggle can be found! While at Banja Luka the mutineers showed that
they had lost when they began to accept the view that their demands could
only be realised by the state, in Lithuania other soldiers mutinied. By
this type of action proletarians bring more and more to the fore our only
response as a class faced by wars of extermination: revolutionary defeatism,
the refusal to march along with the plans of nationalism, to be sacrificed
for "their" new country! Wherever the bourgeoisie is able to dragoon citizenised
and atomised proletarians into this mass called "the people" our class
sooner or later raises its head! Elsewhere, the Banja Luka mutiny might
well have been "the first movement of soldiers' rebellion among the Bosnian
Serbs since the start of the war" (as the whole of the media like to proclaim
it) but it was not the first manifestation of proletarian defeatism against
this conflict (see the numerous examples in our main text (1).
<p>Despite the weaknesses seen the contagion of the Banja Luka mutiny nevertheless
gains ground. On 14 September the newspapers announced that not only had
the mutineers hardened their movement but that defeatism had extended to
other units such as the garrison town of Sokolac near Sarajevo.
<p>Riven with contradictions, the mutiny now balances between its strengths
and its weaknesses. The proletarians fall into the trap set by the professionals
of interminable discussion. More and more the mutiny is emptied of its
subversive content and reenters the hellish cycle of negotiations, proposals,
counter-proposals, accords and other rubbish of the same type which changes
ABSOLUTELY NOTHING concerning their intolerable conditions of misery. Little
by little the insurgents came to find a place in the grand permanent spectacle
of bourgeois politics. After some immediate demands aimed at improving
their lot, the proletarians came to be poisoned by politicism and blamed
their misfortunes on one faction of the State as opposed to another. In
the quagmire of negotiations the insurgents forgot their strength in calling
for the resignation of the nationalist government of Karadzic. At the same
moment they allowed back in through the side window what they had kicked
out of the front door: they called for... the anticipated general elections.
Until then they had relied on their own weapons - strikes, defeatism -
in order to impose the improvement of their conditions of life, then they
gave way and submitted to the electoral circus.
<p>Profiting from these weaknesses, the State succeeded, after an initial
period of impotence, in returning the movement to a strict framework of
negotiation in order to avoid being outflanked. The objective was to reduce
it to a particular situation, to reabsorb it and empty it of all subversive
content. For such and such a unit the question of soldiers' pay was to
be played for in negotiations, for another it was the dismissal of certain
"corrupt" officers or politicians, etc.... It was the beginning of the
end. The mutineers no longer even dared to affirm their superiority in
the face of the almighty State. None of the various negotiators of high
rank who successively came to parley with them were taken hostage, something
which would have clearly expressed the seriousness of their demands. No,
once under way, the negotiations developed according to the classic schema
of pacifism and conciliation. Parliamentarism and negotiations became the
real terrain on which the whole force of the bourgeoisie could be successfully
imposed. The movement was prolonged for more than a week. But on both sides
there was the <i>status quo</i>. After having tried in turn, threats, flattery
and appeals to patriotism, the bourgeoisie were quite obviously banking
on a deterioration of the movement. The time and lack of perspective of
proletarians had strengthened the bourgeoisie.
<p>They tried to play for time and to "justify" the demands, but not the
methods, of the mutineers. In taking on board some of their demands the
bourgeoisie tried to fix the movement while letting it decline. They thus
hoped to put off proletarians by isolating the most combattive, by accusing
them of being "traitors". They appealed to them to go back to barracks,
all the while waving the flag of "the fatherland in danger". Stigmatising
the revolt as "helping our enemies" they made a vigorous appeal to the
patriotism of the mutineers as the fighting redoubled its violence in Krajina.
<p>In line with parliamentary logic the mutineers had scaled down their
demand for <i>"energetic measures against war profiteers"</i>. And who
was this addressed to and demanded of!? To the State, to those who are
the most important representatives of the class which LIVES off war: the
bourgeoisie. Despite the fact that they affirmed that the existing MPs
<i>"are
not fit for their jobs"</i> which they abuse <i>"to enrich themselves"</i>
their <i>"black list"</i> never included those that they negotiated with!
This was another of these proletarians' contradictions.
<p>Once destabilised and worn out the mutiny gave up its arms and fell
under the two-pronged assault of promises and repression. The state awarded
to the mutineers, who had repudiated their struggle, 10 days leave and
a promise to satisfy their social demands, while a selective repression
struck the principal leaders of the mutiny. The arrests were the final
response of our enemies.
<p>The continuation of capitalist butchery and the return to the diplomatic
game (the negotiations in Geneva) could only be imposed when the proletariat
was beaten!!! <i>"For a new Geneva, calm must reign in Banja Luka!"</i>
The bourgeoisie have always known the art of running war like they run
peace in their best interests - to pacify us, to lead us dociley to the
killing fields, to the factory!!! Benefitting from all the weaknesses of
the mutiny, from its lack of extension, from the democratic poison which
corrupted it, the State crushed it to temporarily restore social peace
and relaunch the war on the battle fields.
<p>Despite the pitiless critique that we must direct against the weaknesses
and expressed limits of this mutiny, communist militants shed light on
such acts that show us that defeatist minorities are alive and well. Such
actions express the point of view of the whole of our class. Tomorrow revolutionary
defeatist mutinies will make the qualitative leap which involves the liaison
and organisation of the struggle against the war WITH THEIR CLASS BROTHERS
AND SISTERS on the other side of the vile frontiers imposed on us by Capital.
<p>But already today the resistance of proletarians in Banja Luka proves
to us that the proletariat is never completely ready to be massacred in
some new capitalist butchery without turning a hair. Nor to accept sacrifices,
austerity, misery, death...

1. Other collective movements of defeatism were also produced this year
on other fronts, like, for example, in Azerbaijan where, to counter the
wave of desertions which undermined the army on the front of Nagorny-Karabak,
the bourgeoisie ordered the suspension of all leave and the enrolment of
all young men between 18 and 25 into the national army starting from April
'93. Sanctions against deserters have also been reinforced, thus confirming
the defeatism which sweeps through the Azeri troops.

<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">General and permanent ways of channeling
class struggle</font></u></h2>
The general way in which the bourgeois order is maintained implies a permanent
negation of any organisation of the proletariat as a class for the destruction
of Capital and the State. Nevertheless, for the bourgeoisie today, it is
not a question of <b>openly</b> negating the interests of the workers as
it was in the early period of capitalist development. It's a question of
limiting and transforming them into the normal interests of citizens and
sellers of commodities. For sure, this also constitutes a negation of the
interests of the proletariat, but in an underhand way. Or, to put it another
way, the best form which capital has found for preventing its historic
enemy from existing as a class (1) is its disintegration into atomized
citizens and/or its dissolution into different corporatist economic sectors
as sellers of labour power (2). The most developed expressions of these
two negations of antagonistic class interests are electoralism and trade-unionism.
It is clear that this permanent negation of the proletariat as a class,
lived every day in the form of social peace, finds its basis, both historically
and logically, in the general terror monopolised by the State. But, for
a change, in this text we'll pass over the decisive role played by the
citizenisation and electoralism which has already been looked at in other
texts (3) and we'll concentrate on a purely "ouvrieriste" channelling of
struggles.
<p>There is no doubt at all that Capital, whenever it can, "deals" with
the proletariat sector by sector in clear accordance with its general tactic
of dividing the proletariat. In this context, the unions and other apparatuses
of control and division of proletarians manage to maintain social peace
by limiting struggles to "strikes" and "demonstrations". Not only do these
"struggles" fail to challenge social peace, but the historic party of counter-revolution
(Social Democracy in all its forms) uses peaceful strikes and demonstrations
<b>as
the way par excellence to channel and exhaust proletarian energy</b>.
<p>In talking about these things we don't just want to refer to partial
work stoppages for which prior notice is given and a fixed period of time
is specified, something which can only delight the bosses. We want to talk
just as much about "strikes" (4) which are organised by the unions with
some degree of radicality (even to the point of violent action, often considered
to be the action of "combative" trade-unionists) but which, in general,
fail to break fundamentally with social peace as a result of their corporatism,
localism and the fact that they are confined to a particular social category,
placing particular demands on such and such a boss or municipal or national
authority. This is generally expressed by the decision of "all the workers"
to prevent those from outside the workplace from becoming involved. In
other words, it is expressed by the unopposed right which the unions have
to run a "struggle" which cannot be a proletarian struggle against Capital,
but simply an expression of particularism and, on a global level, an expression
of bourgeois competition. On the other hand, the force of the Proletariat
finds itself channelled into demands which do not fundamentally attack
the rate of exploitation (they conduct themselves in a responsible way
with regard to "the needs of the national economy") and/or they put up
barriers between the workers from such and such a sector and those from
others. Obviously, in countries where capitalist competition develops on
the basis of separatist, nationalist or even racist struggles these cards
are played in augmenting divisions between proletarians.
<p>As for demonstrations, the principle is the same. Even though such and
such a radical expression is allowed, well-controlled peaceful marches
for pacifying demands and which generally benefit from the complacency
of the forces of order have no other function than making a fake protest
or diverting and wasting the workers' energy (5).
<p>With the development of Capital this type of practice became solidified,
acquiring a veritable certificate of citizenship in all the capitalist
organisations which are more or less stable. Very early on, from the birth
of the proletariat, trade-unions and other apparatuses of the State appeared
along with workers' associations (as a recuperation of these associations
or as direct creations of the bourgeoisie). They varied enormously between
countries but they all had the task of limiting "by the workers themselves"
struggles in order to transform them into their opposite (6). In time,
all the mass permanent workers' associations were recuperated and transformed
into apparatuses of state domination. This is a tangible manifestation
of the impossibility of peaceful coexistence between the interests of capital
and those of proletarians. Contrary to what is affirmed by all the trade-unionists
and social democrats in general (including the Maoists, the Trotskyists
and the Guevarists who support the unions, not as struggling for the historic
interest of socialism but because they defend the immediate interests of
proletarians), even the immediate interests of the proletariat <b>cannot
be defended without confronting Capital and therefore the State</b>.
<p>While the unions consolidated their place on the side of the police
and the army in their function as an apparatus for wiping out our struggles,
the same practices which drive these organisations, that is to say assemblism,
partial work stoppages and controlled "strikes", peaceful demonstrations...
made themselves into an indispensable practice for the maintenance of bourgeois
order.
<p>What are the consequences of this process from the point of view of
the two antagonistic classes? From the point of view of Capital, is there
anything more normal? It is the very process in which Capital affirms and
demonstrates its omnipotence and its pretention to being everlasting, recuperating
everything which yesterday was opposed to it, coopting the people, the
apparatuses, the organisations, the orders, the forms of struggle in order
to put them at its service.
<p>And from the point of view of the proletariat?
<p>If before, when they heard the word "strike", almost all the proletarians
felt concerned, if, in whichever town, village, factory or district, proletarians
got together because life itself was the collective life of the class,
if, during a few decades therefore, the life of the exploited contained
everyday discussions about conditions of life, of struggle, if everywhere
and however heterogeneous the class consciousness might have been, they
discussed the evils of this society, the necessity of destroying capitalism,
attacking the state, constructing a society without exploited and exploiters...
it is undeniable that over the course of the last few decades all this
has disappeared. The proletariat itself seems to no longer exist on a world
level (7). In everyday life, the only things which seem to exist are individuals,
the rich, the poor, the ministers, the unemployed, the delinquents, the
nationalists, the terrorists, the citizens, the peasants, the intellectuals,
the feminists, the students, the voters, the ecologists... The intellectuals
in the service of the dominant class and/or of the old stupid ideology
of the petty bourgeoisie, who speak about the disappearance of the proletariat,
are not just telling lies to delight the world bourgeoisie, they are also
expressing a partial aspect of a reality to which we, proletarians, are
subjected.
<p>The proletarians themselves do not feel that they are proletarians.
This lack of consciousness is that of not even knowing that they are part
of the same class. This one believes that he is superior to the proletarians
because he wears a tie and works in a bank. This one believes himself to
be a poor peasant and this other unemployed. This one believes that her
mission in life is to struggle for feminism, others involve themselves,
on various levels, in capitalist struggles which are racist (including
the anti-racists), nationalist, anti-imperialist... And, finally, they
are not even gathering, talking about life, about the world as proletarians.
In the cafes, people only talk about football... and the majority of proletarians
don't even go to the cafes any more. Proletarians are almost completely
wiped out as human beings, and during the few hours left from wage-slavery
they remain just as spectators. The combination of TV and video has completed
the historic work of the state in putting on an even higher plane the liquidation
of the proletariat and its dilution into individuals and families. After
eight hours imprisoned at work and eight hours passed in sleeping to recover
his strength to return to work, the proletarian is equally today a prisoner
in the eight hours that remain.
<p>Capital does everything that it can to attain the ideal apogee of this
process by achieving a society where it is no longer menaced by its historic
enemy, where the only people living are producers/good-citizens and, where
possible, humanoids, useful idiots for reproducing society without asking
any questions. All sectors of economic activity and research work for the
realisation of this idealist goal. At the factory and in the office they
replace people by assembly-line workers and then by machines. Computers
and robots ideally tend towards a world where all human life has been replaced
by artificial equipment. And biology, genetics and insemination research
have the same objective: the creation of a "person" who isn't one, a "person"
who has been programmed for this society that is to say for <b>Capital</b>.
<p>As long as this humanoid doesn't leave the laboratory, as long as they
are not able to produce a human body which creates value without ever protesting
(8), a genetic body whose capacity for revolt has been completely removed,
they will try to approach this with the greatest possible help of instruments
of collective cretinisation which are video, TV, computer games, elections,
drugs... and for all those who refuse there are all those psychiatric wards,
prisons, asylums, tranquillizers, wars, viruses, nuclear accidents etc...
And, as if this <b>dehumanisation of the human being</b> is not enough,
they promise that soon there will be games with virtual images in which
you can "really enjoy yourself" (9) with a "virtual partner", "travel around
the world", "fight face to face with someone from another continent"...
and all always without leaving your four walls.
<p>It is certainly true that the successes of our enemies are considerable.
Subordination is very deep, confusion is general, there is collective cretinisation
and more of these than ever before. And nevertheless, <b>the proletariat
is not dead</b>.
<p>It is also certain that it doesn't manifest itself like in the past,
on an everyday level, with hundreds of permanent associations, with networks
of solidarity, with international and internationalist groups, with a workers'
press linking proletarians on all continents... But, when it expresses
itself, it does so in a way which is <b>directly violent and generalized</b>.
<p>In effect, while strikes organised by the unions are no longer credible,
while the national political system and its electoral games are no longer
attractive like they were in the past (in times when people still believed
that a parliamentary party or a government could change the situation),
while peaceful demos and other strolls for such and such a partial demand
have lost their charm... while the old state mediations have lost their
capacity to act as <b>safety valves</b>,... the proletariat, which is supposed
to be dead and buried, <b>surges forwards ever more explosively, without
accepting mediations, without being stopped by little strikes, peaceful
demos, or promises of elections</b>.
<p>The more the non-existence of structures of containment of the proletariat
is clearly affirmed, the more they take it as given that the proletariat
has disappeared for ever, the greater is the surprise when generalised
revolts develop in one or several or all the towns of one or several countries.
To mention only the most important revolts, we can cite Venezuela, Algeria,
Morocco, Romania, Argentina, Los Angeles...
<p>It is clear that these examples differ greatly in depth and duration
of the challenge to bourgeois order. We have already had occasion to analyse
this in our publications, but this text is not supposed to deal with the
analysis of these differences nor with the comparison of these situations
but, on the contrary, with the description of their common traits.
<p>So, for example, in our enumeration we don't cite the case of Iraq.
This is not because we are not able to see the aspects of force which you
can see in the majority of proletarian revolts today but, on the contrary,
because in the course of the last ten years that country has known a real
continuity of proletarian associationism, the action of communist groups
and the presence of proletarian banners. This continuity which is exceptional
and against the current of the period, creates a situation of class struggle
in this country largely beyond the general schema that we are trying to
draw up in this article. Without being able to see in advance to what level
the situation in Iraq can contribute to a generalized and global supersession
of the current level of class struggle, we can affirm that this supersession
needs certain elementary conditions for it to happen. The principal condition
is the receptivity of the world proletariat to things which happen in parts
of the world where fundamental class battles are developing. In relation
to this, we can see an enormous weakness of the proletariat which also
translates into enormous difficulties for it to make its struggle known,
to push other sectors of the world proletariat to take action about this
situation. These difficulties also find a particular expression in the
immense difficulty for us, internationalist proletarians, to centralize
international direct action in this direction (10).
<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">The type of proletarian revolts characterized
by the present period: proletarian strenghts</font></u></h2>
In the past, the proletariat daily demonstrated its existence and its antagonism
to the social order. Today, except for the very small revolutionary proletarian
organisations (like ours), which by their existence itself, as a historical
product of the proletariat and of its historical practice, affirm counter
to the current the determination of proletarians, the proletariat only
demonstrates its existence and denies its famous historical disappearance
by those social explosions of the eighties and early nineties (11). We'll
now try to emphasize the aspects which we consider as essential in these
revolts.
<p>These explosions are characterized by <b>the firm and violent action
of the proletariat which occupies the streets and violently confronts the
whole state apparatus</b>. In a streak of lightning, the streets are swarming
with people, and the action is generalized in a flash. The direct occupation
of the streets tends to break violently with all the categories into which
capital divides proletarians : the narrow confines of the factories, mines
or offices smash into pieces. Unemployed, women condemned to housework
by capital, elderly people, children... are unified in direct action.
<p>These revolts generally break out without precise and explicit aims
and rarely put forward anything positive. Most of the time, they start
with a <b>general claim: "We can't bear anything more!"</b> which expresses
at the same time economic, political and social needs. "We can't bear any
more repression and police control", "No, this price rise is uncalled-for",
"Against the police state and the government party", "We want to eat",
"We can't continue to tighten our belts to live", "We refuse the rise in
the cost of such and such bare necessities"... are broadly the elements
which reassemble the unified proletarian action. This is not a particular
feature of the present period. In the whole history of our class, massive
and violent revolts concentrate these collective negations of such and
such an action of Capital and state. The fact which might characterise
the present period is that there is no visible quantitative progression
before the explosion, that before <b>the saturation point of the proletarians'
discontent</b> is reached there is not a whole set of important partial
struggles. On the contrary, the present period is precisely characterized
by this reaffirmation of the existence of the proletariat, so fleeting
that, beyond these moments, it seems that the proletariat is ready to accept
everything, and that capital itself is surprised by the lack of resistance
aroused by its criminal austerity measures (12).
<p>By the very fact of the absence of daily reaction to the different attacks
of capitalism, the latter is encouraged to go further and it effectively
puts the proletariat in a desperate situation. Never has the international
proletariat been so roughly treated, so subjugated to such unbearable conditions,
so stuck in an impasse... Never has it been in such dire straits. This
is another important characteristic of today's struggles which leads to
a real explosion of anger because the proletariat is really put in a desperate,
unbearable position.
<p>The economy has always sacrificed human beings, as Marx pointed out.
But never before have the needs of human beings been renounced so flagrantly
in the name of business interests and national competitiveness. Never in
history has there been so little protestation as nowadays against the absolute
power of the state. Never have such clear and open demonstrations of the
inhumanity which runs this society engendered so little indignation. This
is the same logic which now leads to explosive situations : the proletariat
bears much more than the unbearable, much more than all that we could imagine
until now, and then inevitably it comes to a point where we can't objectively
stand it any more whatever the lies and tales they try to spin us... Consequently
the explosion is inevitable.
<p>The very fact that the struggle takes the form of an unstoppable conflagration
determines an important element of force: <b>the surprise effect</b>. This
paralyses the enemy which has not the slightest idea of how to react (13).
The old reformist social democrat has no effect on the violent and decisive
action of the proletariat. Trade-unionism itself is absolutely unable to
answer and to take control of the generalization of proletarian violence.
The different regional structures or the divisions in districts, social
services and the different state services of social mediation find themselves
totally overwhelmed. The absence of concrete demands makes their reformist
and liquidating task towards the movement much more arduous. If they stand
in front of the proletariat, it -literally- runs over them. This absence
of positive demands and the participation of the proletariat as a class,
not as one or several categories, are precisely the elements of strength
of the movement: the opposition to everything which comes from the state,
the negation of everything which belongs to this dominated existence (this
aspect has always been criticised by the left wing of the bourgeoisie),
vindicates, in fact, the communist revolution.
<p>The protagonists themselves take advantage of this unexpected effect.
The generalized non-communication which normally dominates during periods
of social peace, the supreme individualism which governs daily life, the
"everyone does what he likes in his own home" will be smashed into pieces
by the direct action in the streets (even if this is only true among an
avant-garde minority and if it only happens in moments of open struggle).
All those who take part in these movements discover a solidarity unknown
until then, and they are surprised by the unselfishness which reigns over
the barricades and also by the extraordinary efficiency that structures
action. Moreover, they discover in this neighbour whom they never greeted,
in this colleague whom they all regarded as an idiot, in this friend who
could only talk about football... <b>a comrade who fights side by side
with them</b>.
<p>Each time the police stations, the HQs of government parties, the unions
and other state apparatuses (supplies offices, official administrative
HQ, Courts...) are attacked and burnt. Direct action is used against the
government representatives and the more or less covert collaborationists
are chased away. In some cases, prisons are attacked and prisoners liberated.
Regardless of the more or less diffuse class consciousness of the protagonists,
this demonstrates not only the reconstitution, the existence, of our class
but also the general antagonism between the proletariat and the bourgeois
state as a whole.
<p>There is indisputably another element of strength in these proletarian
revolts: the <b>expropriation</b> of bourgeois property which is more or
less organised by avant-garde groups. By sweeping away the ancestral prejudices
and challenging state terrorism (14), proletarians take what they need
and try thus to destroy all the mediations which they are condemned to
by capital: money, wages, work, etc... For the first time, many of them
really eat what they like and most of those who take part in the revolts
eventually treat themselves to what they always dreamed of without having
to pay for it: a TV set, a heater, an eiderdown or a silk suit. For once
they celebrate, they drink without restriction (and the drinks are less
spoiled than usual when they can't afford them because of their prohibitory
prices), they eat what they like leaving previous daily deprivation aside,
they dance, they sing, everyone's celebrating !
<p>While this elementary affirmation of proletarian interests against bourgeois
property takes place -a fleeting affirmation of human life announcing that
the Dictatorship of the Proletariat against this society of deprivation,
war, and death is possible and necessary- the first organizational problems
arise. On the barricades, in the districts where the police dare not enter,
action groups organise themselves (15) and the criteria come up for discussion:
criteria for action, criteria for sharing out, for using violence, for
selecting the shops to break open, the forms of self-defence to use...
<p>All these protests, these struggles, these lootings... express a real
tendency to assume, in an embryonic way, the civil war towards which capital
pushes us. Very often the soldiers and/or policemen sent to establish the
morbid order of capital refuse to shoot and join the struggling proletarians.
<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">Bourgeois counter-offensive: stick, carrot
and disinformation</font></u></h2>
Of course, everything is not all rosy and the army corps of Capital, specially
trained and formed for these kind of circumstances, do not hesitate to
drown the struggles in blood.
<p>Once the bourgeoisie gets over the surprise produced by the violent
extension of the movement, it prepares its counter-offensive whose key
note is always the same: <b>to separate the majority of the proletarians
from their vanguard</b>. That division relies on the real limits of the
movement, on the real division that takes place in the midst of the proletariat
between those who are actively involved in the struggle and those who are
opposed to it. The power of bourgeois ideology is so strong that even in
those intense and acute moments only a minority will participate in direct
action. Proletarian sectors, more dominated by trade-unions or political
bourgeois parties, not only refuse to participate but also oppose themselves
to those practices and are ready to accept the official version of the
events (or the version of the parliamentary opposition which always corresponds
to the previous one when it is the matter of confronting the proletariat
in struggle).
<p>Based on this principle, all apparatuses of fabrication of public opinion
then play their decisive role in the institutionalisation of lies: only
what is convenient to the police is broadcast (16). The more decisive acts
are discredited and imputed to provocateurs, agents from abroad, terrorists,
international subversion... If moreover the local bourgeoisie can rely
on such or such local, racial, national, ideological... division, all the
means of broadcasting will make the most of this opportunity: "unrest is
spread by foreigners", "it is a fight between Blacks and Koreans", the
trouble-makers come from "the favellas", "are Kurds", "it is a fundamentalist
uprising", etc. These are different ways to express a series of attempts
to negate the proletariat. And of course, those attacks against our class
are echoed, magnified and multiplied by all the international means of
communication. Their most important point will be to hide at all costs,
to prevent by all means anyone from recognising in these revolts general
or universal causes. Proletarians all around the world must never realise
that other proletarians revolt as proletarians; for the media (which are
supposed to inform us) the revolts are never proletarian but "fundamentalist",
"Palestinian", "anti-dictatorship", they are revolts of "immigrants", "starving
people", "Arabs", revolts "typical of the Third World"...
<p>The bourgeois counter-offensive structures itself by organising the
separation between "the good and honest citizen" and "the provocateur",
between the nationals and the foreigners, between the good workers and
the lazy ones, between the normal citizens and the marginal ones, reserving
<b>for
the first ones the carrot and for the second ones the club</b>.
<p>Then comes the moment for concessions: such or such minister or chairman
is dismissed, there are measures against poverty or charity measures, the
price rise that started the uprising is quashed, state shops are resupplied...
And, at the same time, a violent <b>repression as selective as possible</b>
falls on the proletarians. Indeed all handbooks of counter-insurrection
insist on the selectivity of repression, saying that "to avoid the population
being favourable to the subversives, repression must be selective and must
not repress in an indiscriminate way". The intensive work of the official
state apparatuses that apply in the streets active repression against the
most openly combative sectors is not sufficient; that's the reason why,
long before any trouble so-called unofficial apparatuses (paramilitary
groups, half syndicalist/half mafia crime specialists, death squads...)
are preparing themselves.
<p>Disinformation is total: what really happens in the streets is never
told, scenes or photos of "barbarism", of proletarian expropriations, of
fires are mixed up with images of repression, discourses of well-informed
politicians explaining "the reasons for the troubles" and reassuring us
on behalf of the State, Order and Security. And to cap it all, the touch
that will make all those lies so spectacularly true: the camera lingers
on that poor guy whose shop, that was just big enough to make a living
for him, has just been looted and burned (17). Then, progressively and
cunningly what happens in the street is abandoned and we are more and more
bombarded with soothing political discourse heralding the return to a state
of calm, the reappraisal of this measure, the resignation of this minister,
new elections... These discourses express, with the deepest commiseration,
that it is obvious, understood and clear that the situation of misery is
unbearable but that it does not justify such and such an action and that
the movement was in fact manipulated by professional agitators etc. In
those delicate moments when the relation of forces is at stake in the street,
all the State agents collaborate in seeking for political solutions: police,
journalists, priests, sociologists, ecologists, right and left wing parties...
<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">The real weaknesses of our class</font></u></h2>
It is incontestable that the bourgeois are really frightened when such
explosions burst forth. They do back down. We even manage sometimes to
give them the biggest fright they've ever known. On the other hand, for
us these days of struggle are a good opportunity to satisfy some of our
immediate needs. In quarters and even sometimes in whole cities, for the
first time in our lives, it really is fun!
<p>But let's not be foolish, <b>it does not last long</b>. Within an few
days Capital imposes its terrorist order. Often, if not in almost all cases,
the massacre is enormous, the cost in human life and injuries is very high.
Our best comrades are put on file and imprisoned. State terror is terrible.
In Venezuela, Algeria or Los Angeles for instance, after the short-lived
victory that consists in occupying the streets for a while, follows <b>a
deep defeat</b> and we know that many years will be necessary to overturn
it.
<p>That is the reason why <b>it would be criminal</b> to close our eyes
to this reality and to praise these sort of revolts, presenting them as
"the finally found form of the revolutionary struggle" (18). And if we
can't prevent different immediatists and other modernists from praising
this kind of movement, our task, <b>the task of revolutionaries is <i>to
make a militant criticism of these actions</i> of our class</b>.
<p>It is very serious, it is tragic that we are powerless to prevent the
massacre of our comrades. It is sad to see the strength we expressed for
a few days break into pieces in the wink of an eye and to see that overnight
we are again as lonely as before (19). Practical solidarity we have lived
during those days disappears as quickly as it was born. It is terrible
to see that we are unable to get our comrades out of jail. It is really
heart-breaking to see that "everyone for himself" resurfaces as soon as
we quit the streets and that individualism, selfishness and the powerless
citizen again take their central place on the historic stage. Even worse:
<b>the
proper story of what we have been living is negated</b> by the dominant
versions of events and the lapses of our own memory submitted to the lies
of the latter.
<p>Today's world is characterised by the consequences of the tragic lack
of <b>permanent association of the proletariat</b>: no permanent nucleus,
no meeting centre, no massive classist press, no international organisation
of the proletariat able to gather the vanguard of this community of struggle
that shows up here and there. Therefore, the importance of <b>permanent
militant activity</b>, of directly <b>internationalist communist action</b>
centred on a revolutionary program of action, of organisation, of perspectives
such as the one developed by our little group of militants - in spite of
our very weak forces, becomes clear.
<p>The lack of this general form of organisation materializes itself in
decisive moments of action by the lack of clear orders, perspectives and
direction. If class instinct is enough to recognize where to expropriate
and who to attack (generally the cops and other corps of open repression),
as soon as the struggle comes to a more decisive step and the bourgeoisie
shows more subtle faces, as soon as sectors of bourgeois opposition try
to transform the classist content into a particular content... the struggle
against capitalism is transformed into a particular political struggle.
It becomes a struggle against dictatorship, against that government, this
minister, against that unpopular measure or even worse: for democracy,
for the autonomy of the area or for Islam...
<p>But all this is also the result of the fact that, even when the struggle
is at its peak, the lies and tales the bourgeoisie always tells have deeply
penetrated our class. Nationalism, Islamist mobilisations, struggle against
such or such dictatorship... are unfortunately not only bourgeois discourses,
they transform themselves into a material force of disorganisation of our
struggle because tens of thousands of proletarians are led into and mobilized
for the defence of these ideologies. Populism, the renewal of religions
and sects, racism and so-called anti-racism as political movements have
developed a great deal and not only weigh down on us during the endless
periods of social peace but also weigh heavily on and disorganize big battles
of the worldwide proletariat. Many times the bourgeoisie succeeds in deviating
the struggle from its objectives; moreover, in many circumstances it succeeds
in mobilizing a part of the proletariat against another, which is a decisive
step towards the transformation of the social war into an imperialist war
inside a country (20). Without necessarily going as far as the case of
Yugoslavia in which proletarian struggles gave way to a fratricidal war
for bourgeois interests (which is, beyond the qualities of such and such
a local or national faction, a true victory for world capital), in many
cases what is searched for and often reached is the confrontation of one
proletarian sector against another; as in Argentina amongst those who participated
in the "saqueos" (looting), as in the United States where everything was
done to transform the proletarian revolt of Los Angeles into a struggle
between racial communities (although without much success).
<p>To synthesize, we can say today that there has never been such a big
difference between the strength of proletarian action and the lack of proletarian
consciousness of this action; between the classist practice against Capital
and the State and the general ignorance of the determinations of this practice
and its aims; between the homogeneity of the proletariat's conditions and
struggles and the total and international ignorance of belonging to the
same class and of struggling for the same aims; between the practical and
radical questioning of private property and the social ignorance of the
communist project. It is precisely the lack of permanent mass proletarian
organisations and the corresponding lack of a safety valve that make all
those contradictions much more violent than in the past. This typifies
the framework of the present days' struggles, their strengths as well as
their weaknesses. The latter appear through the capacity of capital to
transform our struggles into inter-bourgeois, inter-imperialist struggles
and eventually into a conflict opposed to the subconscious project of the
proletarian struggles (communist revolution), through its capacity to affirm
Capital's project: imperialist war (that is to say renovation of bourgeois
society by a new cycle of war, reconstruction, expansion...).
<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">The necessity and possibility of fighting
against our weaknesses</font></u></h2>
Capital can only offer more misery, more unemployment, more homeless people,
more war, more daily horror... In spite of all this, social peace, the
essential component of this criminal world, will carry on being broken
by these waves of proletarian revolts. The manoeuvring of Capital and its
state agents will not prevent the quantitative and qualitative multiplication
of these revolts. International Organisations, counter-insurrection and
repression services, specialists in futurology foresee them and prepare
to fight them. Trade-unionists, politicians, priests, social workers prepare
to fight new confrontations and do whatever they can to prevent them from
breaking out, but they know that tomorrow their role will be to quell them.
It is only to be expected that the enemy is getting ready.
<p>And us? What the fuck are we doing to be ready? Not much really!
<p>This sad reality cannot be changed just by revolutionary will and consciousness
of such and such a group. Meanwhile the rest of the class is not receptive
and contents itself with the world of misery it is submitted to. The minority
organisation of a handful of communists, whatever their will, whatever
their action and however important their function may be, cannot replace
this immense lack of collective preparation. The disorganisation of our
class, the lack of permanent structures of diffusion, discussion, exchange,
coordination, organisation... cannot be replaced by the insignificant activity
of small groups.
<p>That is the reason why, in the short and medium term, these kind of
revolts will carry on with all their strengths and, above all, unfortunately,
all their weaknesses. We will not be able to prevent the future revolts,
in the short term, from ending in heavy losses for our class. Disorganisation,
dispersion provoked in our ranks by the enemy as soon as it reorganises
massive repression and begins to shoot at us, the fact that the proletariat
can't even rely on groups being able to reply to State terrorism by the
elementary selective terrorism of our class, the absence of structures
of international solidarity, the quasi-non-existence of proletarian structures
able to diffuse what's going on in other parts of the world and, generally,
the disorganisation of the proletariat as a class will allow again and
again in many places the bourgeoisie to take revenge for our revolts by
arresting, brutalising, torturing, killing or allowing to die in their
jails elements of the proletarian avant-garde.
<p>Even worse, the bourgeoisie will carry on hiding the class character
of future revolts. It will carry on writing that these revolts belong to
particular causes and the majority of the proletarians will remain indifferent,
sure that these are "Islamist" revolts or revolts "against dictatorship"
or "corruption". As in the past, this false interpretation will be part
of reality (as a philosopher said a long time ago: "The false is a moment
of the true") and Capital will do everything to transform it into the one
and only truth, in order to transform class struggle into inter-bourgeois,
inter-imperialist struggle.
<p>But this situation will not last long, on the one hand because of the
ever more general homogenisation of capitalism which will hinder the attempts
to hide the uniformity of the conditions of struggle of the proletariat,
and on the other hand because of the unavoidable awakening that will ensue
from the multiplication of that kind of revolt and the defeats which follow.
<p>Crisis homogenizes the general condition of Capital's development. Not
only are capitalists' problems always the same, not only is there unavoidably
more and more famine, poverty, unemployment... but, moreover, the economic
politics of governments around the world become more similar every day.
Besides, the room to manoeuvre is shrinking and the discourses do not change.
They all accept what they call "realism" and "pragmatism" and that is nothing
other than the open recognition of their own submission to the diktats
of the economy. What is new is not this submission as such, it has always
been like that, but the <b>generalised admission of that submission</b>.
If the discourses of the right and left wings, from the North to the South,
of imperialists as well as so-called "anti-imperialists", of nationalists
and Islamists look more and more like each other, it is not because these
factions are becoming more capitalist than before, nor because the kind
of capitalist management called "Communism" has disappeared, but because
in a period of expansion Capital can allow different forms of management
while in a period of crisis, world Capital develops one sole dictatorial
direction: to tighten one's belt. While in certain epochs, on the basis
of a maintained increase of the real wage, Capital is able to manage the
labour force in a popular way while hiding the permanent increase of the
rate of exploitation (which leads to different economic politics more or
less populist, state controlled, protectionist...), in periods of crisis,
and above all in periods of deep and generalized crisis such as the one
we are living now, the law of value violently imposes itself and forces
all the bourgeois factions to fight against their own proletariat and against
their competitors (21) to maintain the process of valorization. The "normal"
growth of the rate of exploitation giving insufficient results, the struggle
against the proletariat requires (in almost all cases) to impose a decreasing
of the real wage.
<p>The unavoidable and universal enforcement of the same economic politics
against the same social class, the repetition of the same type of discourse
all over the world to justify this politics ("sacrifices are unavoidable",
"we must produce more and in a more profitable way", "let's defend the
competitiveness of our country"...) tend in the end to unify the reaction
of the enemy... and to unify <b>the enemy itself</b>, in spite of all the
ideological efforts made to prevent that unification. The latter is, first
of all, the more or less automatic and pre-conscious result of the unavoidable
reaction unified in time and space. Its reproduction, the coincidence in
different places of the world of this kind of revolt will for sure complicate
the role of those ideologues and journalists (i.e. to hide the common causes
of the revolts) which opens the possibilities of a process of effective
realization for the constitution of one class against one enemy.
<p>At the same time, the qualitative and quantitative intensification of
these revolts, the repetition of the defeats will open the eyes, the ears,
the spirit... of the proletariat who will compare its own experience, who
will hear the experience of its neighbours, who will search for that of
other regions, other epochs. In the beginning those who will begin this
process will be few but, in one way or another, each of us, as militants,
are the product of this kind of forced opening, of this kind of post-action
thinking, of the essential supersession of the barriers which held back
the previous struggle, of the balance-sheet of a wave of struggle that
did not end where we wished it would end. Revolutionaries, those who really
lead the class forward, those who at every concrete moment of the movement
represent the interests of the whole, the internationalist and historical
interests of communism... the revolutionaries do not train themselves through
books, they are the complex product of concrete experiences, of attempts
to generalise these experiences, of militant efforts of abstraction. They
put to the test their embryonic conclusions and compare them to those reached
in other places and other circumstances. It is in this context that militant
books and writings have their true significance, which is to transmit experiences,
to recover the historic memory of our class, to draw a balance-sheet of
defeats in order to organise the perspective of victory, to develop and
affirm the communist program. The process is long, hard and difficult...
but there is no other way!
<p>Contrary to the social democratic vision of a party of bourgeois intellectuals
who know everything and teach it to the passive and ignorant masses, social
reality is quite different. The proletariat engenders factions, groups
able to synthesise the historical experience it has accumulated, and that's
the only way to break from idealism, to avoid making the same mistakes
again and again in different times and places.
<p>But those revolutionary groups, more isolated today than ever in the
past, will only be able to assume their task of revolutionary leadership
when the future struggles push more and more sectors of the proletariat
to break from the ideologies that imprison them today, when minorities
will begin to be clearly seen, when their preoccupations, the preoccupations
of communists, will be put forward: <b>revolution</b>, the struggle against
capitalism in all its forms.
<p>Only then will our enemies flying on this idyllic and soporific cloud
where communism has been buried once and for all, where the conviction
that the proletariat is dead reigns, where they can sleep soundly since
no one will ever shout LONG LIVE THE SOCIAL REVOLUTION, suddenly feel the
greatest <b>fear of the century</b>. They will wake up from this marvellous
and stupid dream to which the society they represent keeps them submitted.
The harder they fall!
<h3>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">Notes</font></u></h3>
1. As we have already said several times, democracy should not be seen
as a simple <b>form</b> of domination; it corresponds to the very <b>essence</b>
of capital, to the normal way in which generalized mercantile society functions.
In the marketplace social classes don't exist: there are just free and
equal buyers!
<p>2. For clarity of explanation, we have to present as separate moments
what are certainly two sides of the same process in which this negation
of the proletariat as a class is realised.
<p>3. Like for example "1984,..'85,..'87,..'89 pire que prevu. La citoyennisation
de la vie" in <i>Le Communiste</i> No.27 and "Contre le terrorisme d'Etat,
de tous les Etats existants" in <i>Le Communiste</i> No.26.
<p>4. If we put "strike" between inverted commas it is because a real strike,
for us, is a battle between proletarians and capital whose content as well
as its form will tend to express this reality in thousands of different
ways: absence of precise demands relating to such and such a category of
workers, tendency to be generalized, indefinite duration, sabotage of production,
confrontation with the scabs, appearance of "uncontrolled" minority groups...).
Here, on the contrary, we are talking about a trade union action (that
is to say the action of an apparatus of the capitalist state) having the
aim of channelling, and therefore liquidating proletarian energy.
<p>5. In certain cases, the division of labour between the apparatuses
of the bourgeois state (for example between unions and the forces of order)
allows even a certain dose of minoritarian violence, which of course never
attacks the bourgeois order. Thus as long as the majority of the demonstration
is peacefully contained by interminable union speeches, they tolerate or
even promote a radical part of the demonstrators breaking away and throwing
themselves at the special forces of the police who are specially prepared
for this to happen. The bourgeoisie and its property remain well protected
and it takes advantage of the situation to arrest radical proletarians
and to put possible activists on file. Each state force carries out its
function, one using truncheons, the other using diversion (which is obviously
not to say that the unions don't use overt repression as well). So the
force of the proletariat, incapable of leading itself towards its own goal
and using minoritarian violence against its real class enemies, is squandered
without calling capital into question.
<p>6. In opposition to the decadentist myth which says that unions corresponded
to the interests of the proletariat until 1914, we will take the opportunity
in this footnote to remind you that since their origin, in particular during
the whole of the 19th century, there were unions whose objective was identical
to that of the unions today: class conciliation betraying the immediate
interests of the workers... Already in 1890, the Catholic Church in France
recommended the creation of unions against the proletarian struggle. We
would draw the attention of the reader to the article "Mouvement communiste
et syndicalisme" in issues No.4 and 6 of <i>Le Communiste</i>.
<p>7. This disappearance of the proletariat is only apparent because, in
the last instance, the very existence of bourgeois society has its foundation
and its source of reproduction (expansion) in the proletariat itself. But
it is true that the proletariat as a class, as a force, as a power opposed
to capital, is negated. And this reality can only be totally put into question
in <b>practice</b>. That is to say that it is useless, in a period like
the one we are going through today, just to say: "The proletariat exists".
The proletariat will only fully exist when it constitutes itself anew as
a force of social opposition against the existing bourgeois order. Of course,
to complete this statement, we must add that materially the possibility
and the necessity of this reconstitution of the proletariat as a class,
and therefore as a party, is based on the permanent antagonism of this
society, an antagonism which the bourgeoisie cannot abolish, not even in
the golden ages of total domination. The hundreds of sporadic and discontinuous
battles which we are trying to schematize in this text already carry in
themselves the development of this movement of reconstitution of the proletariat.
<p>8. Our attention will be drawn, with good reason, to the fact that,
as long as value essentially comes from human labour, a humanoid will not
create value and that, for capital as a whole, this limit will be its own
death. Nevertheless it is not capital as a whole which runs this world,
but the life and death struggle between all the multiple particular capitals;
a struggle in which each of these capitals obtains extra surplus value
from each move in the direction of this humanoid and is therefore interested
in the development of productive forces in this direction. To suppose that
capital is able to stop its own suicide and/or the suicide of humanity
is to attribute to it virtues of planning which objectively it doesn't
have.
<p>9. We don't think it's necessary to explain to our readers why we put
inverted commas round these "enjoyments".
<p>10. On this subject see the article "Direct action and internationalism"
in <i>Communism</i> No.8 (july 1993).
<p>11. Explosions of this type which, in some cases, only affect an area
of a town, in other cases a whole town or a whole country or even extend
beyond the borders, are obviously not the only forms of struggle today,
but we consider that they are the most characteristic forms of present
day struggles. The proletariat also demonstrates its existence and its
antagonism to the world order when it refuses to be enlisted or when it
deserts, but, except for Iraq, these ways in which it expresses itself
are not the determining ones today. We could also mention a unionist strike
overwhelmed by proletarians who leave their factory to generalize their
struggle; but considering that the proletariat expresses itself in that
form more rarely and with less importance than in the past, this is not
worthy of our attention, least of all in this general outline of present
class struggles.
<p>12. The experts of the World Bank and of the International Monetary
Fund go to the point of congratulating themselves on the lack of opposition
of populations to the measures which they recommend, and this becomes for
them a strong argument to convince governments and political parties to
put these measures into practice.
<p>13. We refer of course to the social mass of the bourgeoisie and of
the classical state apparatuses. It is clear that for a long time the state
has had its special corps (for direct as well as ideological repression)
ready to carry out manipulation of information, selective repression etc...
as we'll schematically explain in the next chapter.
<p>14. If it is clear that it is not the state which creates property but
that the opposite is true, because the State is nothing else but <b>property
fortified to reproduce itself</b>, we can't forget that the human being
respects private property and even goes to the point of starving to death,
because he is deprived of the property of what is most essential, while
on the other hand there is a tremendous amount of waste. And this only
by the pressure brought on him by centuries and centuries of state terrorism,
by the ideology of respect for property which this terrorism has managed
to impose and reproduce through its ancient work.
<p>15. In many cases, after a moment's surprise, special corps for the
defense of private property are organised and the proletariat responds
by limited forms of organisation and arms.
<p>16. Just asserting that journalism is at the service of the State would
mean that we are too condescending to journalists. In reality, journalism
is one of the components of the State and contributes to drawing up its
politics. On the other hand, it would be false and partial to consider
that it is this state apparatus (or any other means of communication) that
leads all the others. That conception, quite fashionable for some modernists
or ex-ultra-left militants, is nothing but an idealist interpretation of
the thesis of "the society of spectacle" which forgets the fundamental
determinations of Capital. If journalism can, in certain circumstances,
"lead" the police, the government, the army... it is itself more often
"led" by the police, the government or the army, and we cannot forget that,
fundamentally, the motor of this component remains <b>value valorising
itself</b> and that any structure of the State is submitted to the central
determination of the State: to reproduce Capital, to reproduce the domination
of the bourgeoisie, to reproduce the exploited as exploited. To pretend
that the journalistic spectacle leads the world is nothing but a spectacular
submission to the world of spectacle.
<p>17. In these revolts there <b>can</b> be unfair, incorrect expropriations,
individualistic and selfish acts of little chiefs. There can also be participants
acting as provocateurs to denigrate the movement. But contrary to the police
and journalists' version it is never the essence of this kind of movement.
It would be absurd to pretend that such problems do not exist. The transformation
of the individualistic and selfish mass on which Capital is based into
a compact and revolutionary class is a long process that is only (re)beginning
with these revolts.
<p>18. During the 1917-23 wave, this formula referred to the councils and
the soviets (useful structures for the organisation of proletarians) considered
as the form that would eternally guarantee the revolution. But no organisational
form can guarantee a revolutionary content, and councils as well as soviets
ended up everywhere (and clearly in Russia and Germany) in guaranteeing
the functioning of Capital. The uncritical praise of these forms (councilism)
was the best ally of the capitalists in the process of reorganisation.
<p>19. Of course some contacts, some relationships produced from the movement
are indestructible, and develop themselves in the preparation of new struggles.
But seeing the present world wide situation, we may say that these are
much too rare exceptions to characterise this period.
<p>20. The clearest example of this kind of liquidation of a proletarian
struggle is the 1930s in Spain where World Capital succeeded in transforming
the revolutionary struggle of the proletariat against capital and the State
into an inter-bourgeois struggle, an imperialist struggle between fascism
and anti-fascism, which constituted a decisive step towards the so-called
"Second World War".
<p>21. About the unavoidable exacerbation of the war of the proletariat
against inter-bourgeois war, see the text "The capitalist catastrophe"
in this review.

<font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+4>The development of class struggle
in Nigeria</font></font></h1></center>

<center>
<h1>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">* <font size=+4>*</font> *</font></h1></center>
An important wave of proletarian struggles developed in Nigeria during
July and August 1994. There was an almost uninterrupted succession of strikes
and riots. The State finally put an end to the movement by using its usual
arsenal of repression. In order to exhaust and then to smash proletarian
action, the unions diverted strikes into demands for the replacement of
one bourgeois faction by another whilst the police organised more and more
widespread arrests.
<p>One of the centres of proletarian agitation was organised around the
workers of the petroleum industry. This sector is vital for the national
economy, Nigeria representing the fifth largest producer in OPEC, with
a production equivalent to that of Kuwait. Strengthened by a long experience
of struggle which has regularly manifested itself by strikes and sabotage
of production in the Nigerian delta (the main concentration of oil wells,
refineries and terminals), the oil workers led a strike which had serious
repercussions on the national economy.
<p>This strike constituted an important reaction by our class to the aggressions
we are subjected to. Moreover, it took place in a country which dominant
ideology considers to be "underdeveloped" (with all of this concept's racist
undertones, which go as far as denying the existence of proletarians in
these countries). Repercussions of the struggle have affected world market
prices; the price of a barrel of oil rocketed due to the standstill of
Nigerian refineries and a halt on exports. At the very time that the bourgeoisie
was broadcasting, to whoever would listen, that there was "light at the
end of the tunnel", that "the end of the recession" had come, that, for
the industry, this "cautious recovery" (1) necessitated a growth in primary
energy consumption, this movement of struggle shattered the illusions capitalists
were using to comfort themselves. The ideologists thought they had buried
the proletariat once and for all, and yet here it was, rising in struggle
at the heart of Africa.
<p>Let's take this opportunity to show our recognition of the struggle
of our proletarian brothers in Nigeria and to emphasise the ever increasing
ridiculousness of eurocentrist ideologies which try so hard to deny the
proletarian character of such fights. <b>The anti-capitalist action in
Nigeria reaffirmed, in practice and with force, the universality of the
living and fighting conditions of the world proletariat.</b> It occurred
in spite of the bourgeois thesis developed by self-proclaimed "internationalist"
groups, which denigrates workers' struggle when it breaks out anywhere
other than in so-called "central industrialised countries". It occurred
in spite of the racist and nationalist theses which cannot conceive the
proletariat as being anything other than "white", "European" or even "Londoners".
It occurred in spite of this eurocentrist vision, which is no more than
the negation of proletarian internationalism. In Nigeria, as everywhere
else on this bloody planet, our method for imposing our class needs is
the same - strikes, riots and attempts to organise the struggle.

<font face="Comic Sans MS">oOo</font></h2></center>
Having camouflaged the imperialist interests that gave rise to more than
a million deaths in Rwanda, the bourgeoisie has not hesitated to broadcast
information concerning the massacres. On the other hand, information on
Nigeria was subject to a total blackout - and for a very good reason: the
international means of disinformation would much rather shed their crocodile
tears in situations where proletarians are undergoing fullscale massacre,
than they would wish to dwell on a dangerous example of a determined attempt
by our class to assert its own interests through combat.
<p>Every time the proletariat responds with direct action, asserting itself
as an autonomous force, the bourgeoisie envelops the emerging struggles,
first by total silence and then by a faultless cover-up. This allows a
subsequent reduction of such actions to what they never were, for example
a "struggle for more democracy"... The proletarian insurrection in Iraq
in March 1991 is one remarkable example of what the bourgeoisie is capable
of in terms of organised lies (2).
<p>In any case it is certain that the fighting proletariat in Nigeria had
absolutely no respect for the rules of the "democratic alternation" so
appreciated by the bourgeoisie. Proletarians have set the struggle of class
against class in opposition to the choice between "military" and "civilian"
government, put forward by the bourgeoisie to justify democracy.
<p>The history of our class, in Nigeria as elsewhere, is marked by numerous
struggles, sometimes bloody, in defense of its immediate -and therefore
also historical- interests against the sacrifices enforced by the worldwide
bourgeoisie. We would like to remind ourselves of some of these struggles
before describing the movement that has just taken place.

<font face="Comic Sans MS">oOo</font></h2></center>
In 1986 a further step in the deepening of the international economic crisis
forced the Nigerian bourgeoisie, as everywhere else, to impose the austerity
measures needed for it to withstand international competition and thus
attempt to relaunch its businesses (3). Under the aegis of the IMF, the
government tried to enforce a <i>"structural adjustment programme"</i>,
that is to say, an austerity plan involving restructuring, dismissals,
wage cuts, etc. Various concrete measures were taken in the years that
followed, notably the launching of a <i>"new industrial policy"</i> which
aimed to achieve <i>"increased productivity and rationalisation of the
public sector"</i>- in other words, ever increasing misery and sacrifice
imposed on proletarians. The following year, not knowing how else to realise
its needs, the bourgeoisie concocted a 3-year development plan towards
a <i>"mobile horizon"</i> (sic!).
<p>Proletarian resistance to these measures was such that the IMF admitted
its reluctance to carry on with its loans if there were no <i>"quick improvements"</i>.
In other words, the world State, as always, gave its local lackeys carte
blanche to subdue our class. In this situation of unstable social peace,
the various bourgeois factions present have to be capable of recognizing
which of them is best able to get the bitter pill of austerity swallowed.
In Nigeria this task was incumbant upon the "military" bourgeois faction.
<i>"How
could a civilian government apply measures of austerity indispensable to
the execution of the structural adjustment plan in these conditions?"</i>
wrote the press at the time.
<p><b>Machine guns and bullets</b> are what Capital holds in store for
the proletariat when it starts to fight!
<p>In 1988, in response to an increase in the price of fuel, riots broke
out in Jos and Sokoto, which turned out to be the start of more intense
waves of struggle. In May and June 1989, several towns such as Lagos, Ibadan,
Benin City and Port Harbour revolted against the IMF's plan, resulting
in between a hundred and two hundred deaths. <i>"Army shoots on sight to
prevent a generalisation of troubles likely to challenge policies of structural
adjustment"</i> a bourgeois newspaper openly declared. Numerous soldiers
came within a hairsbreadth of fraternising with the proletarians. Fearing
the persistence of disorder, the bourgeoisie didn't dare increase the price
of public tariffs nor decrease subsidies of basic commodities.
<p>In April 1991 new riots broke out in the North, in Kano, Katsina, Bauchi
and Lagos. As always, in order to wipe out the clear outline of class war
and to prevent this fight from linking up with other moments and places
of struggle, the bourgeoisie encouraged the development of inter-ethnic
polarisations, a tactic to divide proletarians and, as a result of ensuing
micro-nationalisms, to atomize their struggle. The bourgeoisie needs to
put us into specific categories, each one having something particular to
defend. The bourgeois misinformation expresses this reality ideologically
by stressing the definition of each ethnic category and according them
marked differences in their political perspectives. The hand is played,
the proletariat no longer exists. In the eyes of the media, every social
movement is shattered into a mosaic of religious, ethnic, political,...
factions. Thus we hear of "muslims in the North", "Christians in the South",
"military partisans in the mountains" and "supporters of democratic alternation
along the coast". What rubbish!
<p>It is the same interests, antagonistic to those of the hated class,
that lead proletarians to fight in the north as in the south. This reality
is clearly visible at the heart of the struggle (4). An example was seen
at the end of May 1993, when the Emir of Kano (a large industrial centre
in the North, "muslim", as the choir of journalists loves to keep on chanting!)
was stoned by proletarians from a very poor neighbourhood during the sacrosanct
procession of Sallah, the Festival of Sacrifice. This no doubt did the
Emir some harm, but also put the fables about the religiousness of the
region's proletarians and their supposedly different resultant interests
into perspective.
<p>In May 1992, at the same time as proletarians were invading the streets
of Los Angeles, USA, new riots broke out all over Nigeria. The reasons:
a devaluation of the Nigerian currency by 70% and a serious fuel shortage
which sent the prices of public transport sky high. Lagos, Ibadan, Kaduna,
Port Harbour, Benin City, Abuja,... were in revolt. The unions only succeeded
in restoring calm several days later and with the help of the army's ferocious
repression.
<center>
<h2>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">oOo</font></h2></center>
In June and July 1993, confronted with an unprecedented crisis and the
proletarians' dissatisfaction, amplified as a consequence of a further
devaluation, the bourgeoisie was dreading an explosion of more troubles.
In the face of rising tensions, the government threatened to declare a
state of emergency. The <i>"international community"</i> - that is to say
the World State of Capital - was extremely worried about the situation.
If proletarian struggle were to set Nigeria ablaze, the movement could
reverberate, like a shock wave, through neighbouring countries, a catastrophe
for the world bourgeoisie. To convince oneself of this, it's enough to
remember the importance of the interests at stake for the large petroleum
companies such as Elf Aquitaine (France), Occidental Petroleum (USA), Shell
(Anglo-Dutch), throughout practically the whole of Black Africa.
<p>It was in this context of growing social instability that the local
bourgeoisie performed its hackneyed old election trick, organising presidential
elections on the 12th June 1993. In a spectacular show, closely followed
by the media, the "military" bourgeois faction's candidate, General Babandiga,
was set against his "civilian" opposition, the millionaire Moshod Abiola,
candidate of the "Social-Democratic Party". In an attempt to maximise votes
in the decaying, but highly populated, suburbs of the cities, Abiola centred
his electorial campaign on the populist theme of <i>"goodbye to poverty"</i>.
Why not <i>"let's all become millionaires"</i> while we are at it?! As
if the bourgeoisie had anything other than misery to offer us!
<p><b>These elections were an out and out failure for all bourgeois factions.</b>
The turnout was very poor at support meetings organised by the "military"
faction in Kano, Kaduna and Katsina (a region traditionally presented as
one of its strongholds). On the 23rd of June, the "military" faction cancelled
the elections and published a press release justifying the halt to the
<i>"democratic
process"</i> in order to <i>"avoid ridiculing the country's legal and judiciary
system"</i>. The scandalised "civilians" denounced the <i>"confiscation
of the democratic process"</i>. However, this cancellation was merely a
logical progression from their inability to publish official results -
since it was an election without any results, easy to appreciate when one
realises that only 30% of the population turned up to the polling stations.
From our point of view, a 70% level of abstention is always of relative
interest and expresses, even if only in a very passive way, a certain refusal
by the proletariat to collaborate with the construction its own misery.
<p><i>"Democratic process"</i> or not, what the proletariat is looking
for is a profound transformation of its conditions of existence. Its life
is a hell permanently fuelled by the obligation to work to survive, its
life a non-life, and it is certainly not the election of a new administrator
that is going to change anything about the situation.
<p>When the bourgeoisie talks about <i>"democratic process"</i>, demanding
free elections, the respect of Rights, freedom of the press etc, it is
referring to a simple change in the form of government that no more challenges
the administration of exploitation than it does the situation of proletarians.
In the context of Nigeria, it was a parliamentary government that gave
way to a Bonapartist government. Democracy, as we have explained several
times before, is merely the expression of a market reality which claims
that there are no proletarians nor bourgeois in the world of Economy but
only buyers and sellers of commodities. In this way, one of the most profound
resolutions of democracy is to recruit proletarians (negated as such) and
to turn them into responsible citizens (that is to say either silent citizens
or ones who regurgitate the speeches of those who dominate), either by
force... or by way of the vote. The vote itself expresses little more than
docility with regard to the system set up to exploit the proletariat. The
important thing for the bourgeoisie is that every citizen participates
in the elections and, in doing so, becomes dependent on his vote. If he
is not happy, he just needs to choose a better administrator next time.
The parliamentary game can only function with the participation of a majority
of individualised proletarians, an a-classist concept, if such a thing
exists.
<p>If, as has been the case in Nigeria, a general refusal to participate
in this circus is expressed, it falls on the most suitable bourgeois faction,
be it unionist, military, religious or other, to take things into hand.
It is of little importance to capital whether its administrators are "civilian"
or "military", as long as its administrative requirements are met. It's
obvious that each type of government (whether parliamentary or Bonapartist)
has both advantages and drawbacks and is never purely "civilian" or "military".
Predominantly parliamentary governments (classified along with "civilian"
government) clearly do not mind imposing austerity measures or even organising
"coups". Similarly, the more Bonapartist governments (classified along
with "military" government) are quite prepared to play the voting game
as long as it makes their task easier. It all depends upon how much room
for manoeuvre the ruling faction of the time has at its disposal, which
itself depends upon the social situation.
<p>We therefore see how these types of governments alternate: when one
loses its credibility, the other can take its place and vice-versa. But
whatever form a government takes, it's always the need for capital's administration
that predominates in this choice, even if it's the balance of force between
classes that finally imposes one or other form of government on the bourgeoisie.
<i>"The
halt of the democratic process"</i>, as evoked in the Nigerian Generals'
communique, merely expresses this passage from one form of government to
another. The "civilians'" demand to <i>"restart the democratic process"</i>
is actually just a spare fuse, to keep in reserve, lest the "military"
fail to bring the situation under control (5).
<p>At the end of June, the agitation became more extensive again; in several
cities in the south-west, proletarians erected barricades to confront the
forces of order. In Ibadan, proletarians <b>attacked the prison</b> and
freed hundreds of prisoners. In Lagos, they <b>devastated the trade union
headquarters</b> as a protest against the cancellation of the general strike.
<p>On the 5th, 6th and 7th of July, whilst Abiola and his gang were declaring
themselves winners of the election and calling for people to put their
trust in them, the proletariat took to the streets. Riots and looting broke
out. In Lagos, the government showed itself incapable of pushing back the
rioters who were crossing the district, pillaging everything as they went.
Young proletarians descended from the suburbs to the town centre, erecting
barricades, burning cars and attacked the <b>Central Bank of Nigeria</b>,
as well as several supermarkets. Many cops were killed. The insurgents
held the main roads of the city as well as the bridges and attacked military
convoys to get hold of weapons and set fire to army vehicles. The government
responded by sending in the army. But, as in 1989, even the heart of the
army itself was bursting with internal dissent. Was it to be mutiny, defeatism
or further inter-bourgeois polarisations? To this day, very few details
have reached us but it is clear that the social contradictions at the very
heart of the army motivated this "dissent".
<p>In the weeks that followed, "civilians" and the "military" negotiated
with a view to forming a government of national union. However, the "military"
faction did not believe that the "civilians" would be capable of managing
the social situation. During the whole of August, the "civilian" fraction
tried, with the unions, to prove itself. The agitation continued to grow
and the workers of the petrol industry triggered strike after strike, notably
in the Port Harcourt refinery, pulling in the Kaduna refinery in their
wake, which also had to stop momentarily. Nevertheless, after eight years
of good and loyal services, General Babandiga gave up his place to a civilian
government in <b>a gesture of appeasement and social pacification</b>.
<p>One of the problems confronting the administrators of capital during
these strikes was obviously how to maintain profits drawn from the exploitation
of petrol workers. As a result of the class struggle, major fuel shortages
disrupted the supply routes which, in turn, had a negative affect on other
sectors of the economy. On the other hand, the government was forced into
making petrol subsidies of 95%, in an attempt to prevent further social
explosions, and it was only supposed to cost 0,70 Naira (0,15 FF) at the
pump. However this decision, resulting from proletarian struggle, yielded
little return for the capitalists. As a consequence, fuel was sent to neighbouring
countries instead where it was sold for between 2,6 and 4 FF, that is 17
to 26 times more expensive. Thus, a third of Nigerian fuel was exported,
leading to rises in local prices due to shortages and increasing demand.
The bourgeoisie tried to explain the price rises as being related to episodes
of corruption, amongst other things, but the reality of the problem was
clear: how to increase fuel prices without risking a social explosion?
<p>In November 93, as the "civilian" government decided on new fuel price
increases of 700% to 900% the struggle became stronger than ever. The unions
jumped onto the bandwagon during the general strike organised by proletarians,
which largely hit major industrial cities such as Lagos, Ibadan, Abuja,...
In the Lagos suburbs, groups of young proletarians confronted the police
and the army in violent clashes. Recognising its inability to bring the
social agitation under control, the "civiliam" government was forced to
resign. The situation was taken in hand by the "military" faction under
the leadership of General Sanni Abacha. Before they were able to gain sufficient
reinforcement by spreading more widely, the strikes were smashed by force:
<i>"the
country could no longer put up with the dislocation and the destruction
of its economy"</i> the "new" rulers declared.
<p>That was the position at the end of 1993. The "military" silenced all
demands and proletarian struggle appeared to have been crushed by the new
government's iron grip.

<h2>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">oOo</font></h2></center>
But Capital cannot smother the embers of a smouldering social fire indefinitely.
The struggles that broke out during July and August 1993 expressed, as
we stressed above, the maturing of a process in which the proletariat continued
to assert its class interests against all bourgeois factions, each one
of them as discredited as the last.
<p>As far as we know, these struggles regained strength at the beginning
of June 1994, as riots broke out in several Lagos suburbs. Again, barricades
were erected and important communication routes cut off, thus blocking
all free circulation of goods. This arm-wrestling match with the proletariat
had now gone on for several years and the bourgeoisie attempted to break
it by once again playing its old card of "democratic alternation."
<p>In the middle of June, the <i>"democratic opposition"</i> organised
a campaign bringing together <i>"responsible citizens against the military
regime"</i>, in an attempt to put their leader back in the saddle, the
millionnaire (as ever) Abiola. They also organised a week of "civil disobedience"
which culminated in "dead town" days, caricatures of "barricade days" (sic)
and other "days of prayer". But generally in Nigeria, as in Zaire and elsewhere
in Africa, all such attempts at large mobilisation by opposition bourgeois
factions gain very little support.
<p>From the 4th of July 1994, the strike movement was, once again, broadened
by the appearance of the petrol workers onto the scene. In the defence
of their interests, they developed social confrontation throughout the
country and at all levels of production. In this sector the State structures
itself around powerful unions, true spearheads of the counterrevolution:
the NUPENG (National Union of Petroleum and Natural Gas Workers) and the
PENGASSAN (Union of the Petroleum Industry Managers). Concerned to avoid
being overtaken by proletarians organising in an autonomous way, the unions
were forced to ease up on the pressure and to try to take the lead of the
struggle by declaring an "unlimited strike", which was, in any case, inevitable.
Therefore, on the 12th of July, the main trade union headquarters (National
Labour Congress - NLC) recognised the general strike, realising that it
is far better be integrated into a strike and take over its leadership,ie
sabotage it, than it is to be overtaken by the struggles. The trade unions
tried to transfer class opposition from the social terrain on which it
was placed (demands for higher wages, struggles against misery, unemployment,...)
to a strictly political terrain by advocating the replacement of one bourgeois
faction by another, the "military" by the "civilians". But the strike paralysed
all activity in Lagos and other large cities. Simultaneously, there was
a full scale reinforcement of repression. While the workers of the Warri
petrochemical plant were subjected to a <b>lock-out</b>, the fuel shortage
paralysed the whole country. Bloody riots broke out on the 18th of July
in Lagos and Ibadan, proletarians from suburbian slums again coming out
onto the streets. There were more than twenty casualties, amongst them
several cops beaten to death. At Port Harcourt, one of the country's largest
refineries, the consequences of the strike were such that the minister
of petrol stated that it would take several months to resolve all the resultant
technical problems.
<p>On the 21st July, the unions call for a return to work was met by a
multiplication of strikes and demonstrations, the proletariat enforcing
the maintenance of the strike. Further riots broke out in Lagos on the
26th and strikers imposed an immediate halt of all production and trade
by force. Street fights with Capital's mercenaries turned into a pillage
of the commercial centre. At the end of the month, the unions warned the
petrol companies of the risks of sabotage if their bosses were to continue
to employ scabs. These scabs, largely composed of retired and expat workers,
American and European engineers amongst them, were badly beaten up by the
strikers. The unions had to admit that they were no longer in control of
their "base".
<p>At the beginning of August, after a month of strike, the world bourgeoisie
started to worry about the soaring prices of a barrel of petrol on the
world markets. Once again it was the persistence of social troubles that
forced the State, by way of the unions, to take measures to bring the violent
attacks of the proletariat down to the level of negociable demands. On
the 3rd of August, the NLC declared a further "general strike" and tried
to reduce the proletarian movement to a reasonable protest, taking national
interests into consideration. But once again, groups of organised proletarians
went beyond this farce of a general strike and turned it into a real social
clash expressed by arson, looting, barricades, etc in several suburbs of
Northern Lagos. In the same neighbourhoods the previous evening, food trucks
had already been plundered by groups of "young troublemakers" and their
contents immediately distributed to "passers-by" (media quote!). Seeing
the situation taking a turn for the worse, the social firemen (i.e. the
unions) decided to try some damage limitation and called for a return to
work. This appeal, as those before it, proved fruitless.
<p>As a result of these proletarian reactions, the entire national economy
was badly hit. In Lagos, power cuts became more and more frequent, public
transport practically non-existent and electricity plants came to a halt
due to the lack of fuel. On the 5th of August, the Port Harcourt refineries
had to close down again due to the strike. On the 8th, Shell announced
a suspension of its crude oil exports due to damages inflicted on an important
pipeline "in the context of the strike".
<p>In order to force the proletarians back to work, the government had
to purge its own institutions. On the 17th of August, it decided to dissolve
three of the main unions that had proved incapable of taking the lead in
the proletarian struggle and transforming it into a reasonable movement.
This measure, no matter how spectacular it might seem, was merely a simple
and temporary sanction in order to facilitate a future recredibilisation
of these unions.
<p>Simultaneously, the bourgeois toughened up their tone and threatened
that <i>"any further act of vandalism against strategic installations of
the country will be promptly and firmly repressed"</i>. These threats signified
not only a confession by the bourgeoisie that they were in danger, but
also clearly confirmed their need to go on the offensive. A few hours later,
as demonstrations broke out in Kaduna (the major commercial centre in the
north) and Benin City, violent confrontations took place between the strikers
and the army, which had been deployed in strategic areas of these cities.
However, Shell had to announce the closure of the Forcados petrol terminal
(one of its most important) due to sabotage of its installation.
<p>Despite the threats of dismissal, lock-outs, use of scabs, repression,
arrests, there was not an immediate return to work, the petrol workers'
strike continuing. It took the government <b>two and a half weeks</b> to
take the situation in hand and force the proletarians back to the industrial
prisons. By the 26th of August all large public enterprises (petrol sector,
electricity company, etc.) had been militarized. The army took on the task
of mass delivery of fuel necessary for the recovery of production and petrol
stations across the entire country were forcibly resupplied. On the 29th
of August, the army occupied Warri and Port Harcourt. By the 5th of September,
it appeared that the strike had been smashed - in any case the restocking
of petrol continues. Since then there has been a news black out, with no
further information available, other than that order supposedly reigns
and repressive measures have been intensified.

<h2>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">oOo</font></h2></center>
What conclusions can we draw from all of this?
<p>Firstly, we can only comment once again on the appalling lack of accurate
information outside the channels organised by the bourgeois media; we can
only comment upon the critical absence of international and internationalist
networks for proletarian centralisation.
<p>We wanted to write this text in order to circulate the little information
we have on the situation of our class brothers in Nigeria. However, for
the most part, this information has been gleaned from bourgeois newspapers.
We are aware that aspects relating to the organisation and continuity of
struggle, demonstrations of proletarian violence, confrontation against
the unions etc, are (when they are mentioned at all) completely distorted
by the journalists' submissive point of view, as they are unable to venture
beyond the narrow framework of the dominant ideology they are serving.
There has not even been a mention of the existence of organised minorities,
of leaflets from our class, of texts detailing the rupture with democratic
ideology or of demonstrations of proletarian solidarity. These facts are
simply not reported because they do not fit into the framework of the democratic
ideology conveyed by the international media.
<p>In short, we have no illusions about information gathered from our enemies.
On this basis, it is true that the almost total non-existence of our own
class structures is undeniably an expression of our weakness and demonstrates
the balance of forces in the bourgeoisie's favour.
<p>What kind of organisations arose from these years of struggle in Nigeria?
What slogans/watchwords have emerged? What practical lessons did our class
draw from its experience? To this day there are so many questions that
remain unanswered.
<p>At the present time, we do not have enough elements to analyze, in any
depth, the levels of proletarian rupture that were expressed in these struggles,
particularly as far as the existence, permanent or not, of organised minorities
is concerned. However, we have no doubt that workers groups were able to
and/or will be able to emerge, in the light of all those years of social
agitation. We also know that direct action took place on many different
occasions and that there was frequent sabotage in support of the strikes.
This is surely a sign of the existence of levels of workers' organisation,
even if these actions remained limited in their aims, in time as well as
in space.
<p>The organised paralysis of the National Electricity Company and the
degree of structure that this implied is an example of the existence of
such levels of organisation.
<p>We know very well that the the proletarians who instigated these actions
have suffered terrible repression, some militant workers have received
sentences ranging from ten years in prison to the death sentence. However,
it is clear that the way has been opened up and initiatives accomplished
for the structurisation of proletarians and that those minorities who organised
themselves actively to develop the strikes will constitute -if this isn't
already the case today- nuclei for the international organisation of the
proletariat.
<p>We can also conclude that despite all the weaknesses still present in
our class, the bourgeoisie had major difficulties in cooling down the situation
and had to use every trick at its disposal: trade unions, left-wing/right-wing
polarisation, elections, but also and especially, open repression through
arrests, liquidation of proletarians and widescale military deployment.
As in Algeria in 1988, armed repression appears to have been the most effective
method.
<p>Yet in Nigeria, there are no indications that the movement is dead.
This is what is most astonishing compared to the rehearsals of "scenes"
of struggle in most other countries, over the last few years. Throughout
the world, proletarians destroy, burn, reappropriate commodities, kill
a few cops, sabotage... occupy the streets and violently confront all machineries
of the state, but the continuity and homogeneity of their actions and their
generalisation often seem very precarious. Once the struggles have been
smashed it is very rare to see demonstrations of class solidarity and organisation
survive.
<p>It seems that this has not been the case in Nigeria. Since 1988, every
attempt to violently bring the proletarians back on the path to democracy
has ended in a revival of the struggle. Whether faced with promises of
free elections by the "civilians" or truncheon blows by the "military",
proletarians have reacted with strikes, sabotages and pillages, thus demonstrating,
by the systematisation of attacks against the whole State machinery, a
continuity in the struggle which contrasts somewhat with the general characteristics
of today's struggles (6).
<p>We will end by stressing, once again, the common character of the universal
response by proletarians in the face of the permanent degradation of their
living conditions.
<p>Against all illusionists who shout that the classes are dead and that
class struggle no longer exists, against all those who lecture that Europe
is the centre of the world, against those who try to divide us by emphasizing
the particularities of our living conditions according to which latitudes
we struggle in, we reassert that everywhere on this planet we are fighting
the same enemy. The proletariat has to confront the same armies, the same
unions, the same media, the same democrats, the same priests etc, all over
the world.
<p>We will respond to the HOMOGENEITY of our ever-increasingly deplorable
survival conditions by UNITY of proletarian reaction!

<blockquote><font face="Comic Sans MS">In the Collective Agreement between
Keydrill Nigeria Limited and NUPENG, the company listed some of the <i>"covert
forms of resistance and protest"</i> as including theft or fraud, sleeping
on duty, possessing, using or being under the influence of intoxicants
or narcotics, absenteeism, wastage of materials, sabotage and use of 'dirty
language' and malicious damage of company property,... not mentionning
the company vehicles set on fire, the cranes turned over, the graffiti
painted on the walls, the keys to premises get lost or the radios on the
rigs get damaged. Any worker found guilty of any of the above offences
would be summarily dismissed without advance notice.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">All the service companies complained of destruction
and wastage of company property by <i>"ghost workers"</i> leading to thousands
of naira.</font>
<p><i><font face="Comic Sans MS">"It is difficult to provide accurate statistics.
But even in this service company, we have had several experiences of workers
deliberately destroying our property. Most of them are heartless people
who can set rigs on fire. Hence we don't take chances. At the slightest
indication of discontent, we move to nip such actions by 'unknown' workers
in the bud. But definitely, wastage of food and raw material on the rig,
deliberate pollution in order to place oil-producing communities and the
company at logger-heads, and damaging of company property have been employed
in the past to put pressure on the company."</font></i>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">There is a case of a service company at Warri
which imported a machine estimated to cost 1.8 million naira. This machine
would have rendered a lot of service men, welders, supervisors, fitters,
etc. jobless. Within a week workers practically dismantled the machine.
They stole the parts and dumped them into the sea. Till this day, the machine
lies idle in the company's premises.</font>

<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">Baboon dey chop, monkey dey work"</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Oil job is no good. Who can make soup with
oil? Who can drink oil? Impossible! The white man's trouble is more than
oil. They want us to work hard but don't want to pay us well. The rich
consume while the poor works...</font>
<p><i><font face="Comic Sans MS">"It was at the drinking bar on Warri-Sapale
road that a friend told me how he had tampered with the food supplies and
refrigerator on his rig. He did it because the food was bad and the company
initially was fond of serving a lot of non-African food. He is a cook,
so I spoke to a friend of mine in our company who is a cook and we planned
our own. Almost everyone on the rig became sick. We added some sweet tasting
native leaves to the food which caused some mild diarrhoea and stomach
ache. Everyone complained of the food. It almost cost the cook his job,
but since we had complained before, this provided a chance for renewing
the complaints with evidence. It worked. We started getting fresh supplies
flown daily, no more salads and bread but genuine Nigerian foods. If we
had relied on wringing letters, we would be far from our goals today."</font></i>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Drivers in oil companies also related several
experiences: remove car plugs, deflate tires or claim that cars intended
to take manager's representatives to collective bargaining places could
not start. They can take longer routes or just take routes known to "have
frequent go-slow". The end result is that the management's representatives
arrive late or fail to get there and the union declares them unserious
and calls a strike.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Petrol tanker drivers can delay on the way
to delivery or even sell petrol along the way to roadside dealers:</font>
<p><i><font face="Comic Sans MS">"To many people, petrol tanker drivers
are thieves who sell petrol to illegal dealers. They constitute a threat
to other road users with their monster tankers. But none of them has ever
driven a tanker, over long distances, night and day, without rest. In any
case, whatever we do is in aid of survival, which the companies and government
(are) not interested in. The bigmen want petrol to drive their big long
cars but do not care what happens to we 'mekunu' (the poor). If I have
the chance to sell the petrol and the tanker, I will do it any day. That
will be my share of the oil boom."</font></i>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">In 1985, the Nigerian government passed new
decrees prescribing the firing squad for those who sabotage petroleum pipelines
or engage in illegal bunkering of oil. The NNPC extended its efforts to
control bunkering in order to bring more revenues.</font>
