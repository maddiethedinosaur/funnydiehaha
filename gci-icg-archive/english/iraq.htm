Since two years, the analyses about the events in Iraq were certainly not
lacking. All has been said, written, discussed and published. Thousands
of pages explained us the contradictions within the American government,
between the pair Chirac &amp; Schr&ouml;der and their lover Bush, the competition
between the oil company Halliburton and the French one Total-Elf-Fina,
the American empire and its strategic interests, the confrontation USA-China,
dollar against Euro, gas, oil, the lucrative operation of Iraq reconstruction,
the sale of war weapons, etc. But this overdose of words, all this propaganda,
should we add, only shows the terrifying dead end in which the proletariat
(and its vanguards) is nowadays, bogged down in the swamps of bourgeois
analysis. The main thing has been hidden to us, overshadowed, neglected,
masked and disguised: the confrontation between proletariat and bourgeoisie
was written off. This has thus strengthened the dominant speech characterized
by the ideology announcing the end of history (of class struggles) and
the perpetuation of capitalism that the bourgeois would like to see as
eternal, only disturbed here and there by the confrontations between the
various fractions owner of the means of production.
<p>Our starting point is radically different. As communists we don't analyze
events in order to merely understand them, but well in order to transform
the reality, to completely disrupt it and to put the words THE END on this
society of misery, war and famine. To spend one's time describing the throes
of this anthropophagous society, it is taking pleasure in an eminently
passive role and turning into a lab assistant who has a practice of the
biology of capital rather than to be involved in its death, its funeral
and its brutal end. To start from the point of view that appears for us
as the most obvious, the most essential, from the analysis of the destruction
of what destroys us every day as proletarians, this means to decidedly
take place in the heart of the events that go on in Iraq as an active part
of those events, as an active force, as a vanguard. We affirm this even
though nowadays this word is frightening and is often understood in its
Leninist-like version.
<p>Three years ago the Anglo-American troops invaded Afghanistan in the
name of the "struggle against terrorism" and then it was the turn of Iraq.
But in this whole time, we nowhere have read any words explaining the central
issue: where is the proletariat in all this chaos? What does it make? Which
are the alternatives that it faces in its attempt to get autonomous from
all the bourgeois forces in order to bring them down? It is about these
issues that we should discuss nowadays, we i.e. the few small groups of
proletarians that try to maintain the flag of social revolution at the
top, against heavy odds, in this sickening atmosphere of social peace.
And instead of that, most of the people, or even everybody, remain bogged
down in the issue to know if such or such interbourgeois contradiction
is the most fundamental. And when we say that, we don't yet consider the
worse: the inability for a large number of proletarians to see in these
events the struggle of our class brothers. In addition to the disgusting
indifference towards this new massacre of proletarians, there is Eurocentrism
and its racism as a consequence. How many sociological-like discussions
focus on the question to know if there would exist only a shadow of a proletarian
in Iraq? This forgets too fast the unicity of the capitalistic mode of
production, its world character since more than five centuries now, analysis
that we already had the opportunity to develop on several occasions in
this review and that renders null and void all the wild imaginings like
those affirming that in Afghanistan the USA would like to develop the capitalistic
mode of production, and defending that it is for this reason that they
invaded this country. As well, there are some ideologies supporting that
the proletariat would not exist in these regions and that only a whole
of tribes and specific modes of production, as feudalism, would exist.
Arguments heard on several occasions and that prevent all real discussion
on the real needs of our class and the answers to provide, mixing up lamentably
the immediate modes of production, which are often heirs of precapitalistic
old structures (that maintained some of their old shapes), without perceiving
until which point all these ones are subsumed into the capitalistic mode
of production.
<p>To forget that capitalism is the only mode of production that succeeded
in unifying all the other modes of production in the history of mankind,
this is to give all these social democrat ideologies more than their due,
ideologies that undermine, today as yesterday, the camp of the proletariat
and dive it often into false answers. An example of this is the support
to struggles of national liberation or even, for the most idiotic, to the
common anti-Americanism. To discover that capitalism is global in 2004,
like Attac, Le Monde diplomatique or Jos&eacute; Bov&eacute; do, this is
taking the piss of our class, of its history and the ruptures that it already
made with the old world. Marx, in the IVth chapter of the first volume
of the Capital, already wrote in 1867 (we insist: in 1867!): "The circulation
of commodities is the starting-point of capital. The production of commodities,
their circulation, and that more developed form of their circulation called
commerce, these form the historical ground-work from which it rises. The
modern history of capital dates from the creation in the 16th century of
a world-embracing commerce and a world-embracing market." No comment.
<p>Comrades, let's leave this ideological swamp of the bourgeois analysis
in order to go actually back on the way of social revolution again and
to consider the questions that our class needs to resolve. Let's come down
from the ideological balconies of the false knowledge in order to go back
to our place within class struggles and to get the events that take place
in Iraq without the distorting lens through which this society in decomposition
would like we see them. In order to get history to walk on its feet and
not on its head we intend to quickly make a first approach of what is happening
in this region so rich in struggle, i.e. the Middle East.
<p>In spite of the whole propaganda made in order to sink our struggles
into oblivion, we should stress that the Middle East and the Near East
constitute a real social powder keg since decades. One of the major criteria
of intervention of the whole bourgeoisie in this region remains without
any doubt the necessary stabilization of this geographical area regularly
shaken by very important social disturbances. Without going back in time
too far, we can already define a cycle of struggle starting in the seventies,
and the year 1979 as one of its heights when a generalized proletarian
uprising in Iran swept aside all at once the fourth army of the world,
the Shah of Iran and his terrifying secret services. An uprising it was
very difficult for the local bourgeoisie to contain, despite having appealed
to various candidates to the throne during several months. Finally, it
had to call on a radical fraction of social democracy dressed with the
local colors of the ayatollahs' turban in order to break this powerful
movement of struggle. A war launched by Iraq and supported by all the bourgeois
fractions of the planet (from the USSR to France, to the USA and even Israel),
came to complete this work while supporting the ayatollahs in their disgusting
counterrevolutionary task, while enrolling local proletarians in the defense
of the homeland, Islamism or even Pan-Arabism. This is in a very brief
way how the bourgeois all over the world are united, how all the fractions
become unified, in order to face the only nightmare that is continually
haunting them: the social revolution, the overthrowing of their deathly
system.
<p>It is during this kind of events, as it happened the day after the Parisian
insurrection in March 1871 or the Russian one in October 1917, that we
can speak about the materialization of a process that generates a real
world state of capital merging all the fractions of the bourgeoisie that
defend the general interest of the system, its reproduction upon an always
widened basis, and focusing on a point of gravity in order to embrace here
and there state-controlled structures already existing. When the social
revolution knocks on the door of history with all its power, all the exploiting
fractions forget (for a while, that goes without saying) their immediate
interests and side with the more capable fraction of defending capitalism
against the assaults of the proletariat. The world state is definitely
this process, this movement of permanent reaffirmation of the monopoly
of class violence, inter-fractions struggle and generalized unification
facing the historic enemy. In each affirmative period, the world state
defines itself more strongly, while expressing each time in a more explicit
way the organization of capital as an exclusive dominant power, as an exploitation
force that, in order to secure the world social order, requires each time
wilder levels of monopolization of violence in the hands of the bourgeoisie
and particularly of its most powerful fraction. As a world state, capital
is scared of the permanent catastrophe it produces, because this catastrophe
inevitably provokes violent, armed and uncontrolled reactions. It is essential
to defeat these reactions in order to maintain its domination. In these
cases, it turns out that it is difficult to think in terms of country:
the process that leads a more determined bourgeois fraction to restore
order in a socially disrupted region, is often going beyond the commonly
admitted bourgeois division between the states. One can assert that within
the USA as well as in structures like the State Department, the Pentagon,
the CIA, the US Air force, the US Army, a bourgeois fraction more determined
than the others to play the role of world police is asserting itself nowadays
with the support of the whole other fractions, including those with which
it is in competition. During the war Iran-Iraq, and despite the existence
of two blocks, the whole fractions, even those that declared only yesterday
to be enemies, shelved their differences for a while in order to face together
a proletariat that, let's not forget it, had just overthrown one of the
most powerful governments of the planet: the Shah's regime.
<p>The ten years that this slaughter without a name lasted were similar
to the human massacre of 1914-1918 and had inevitably to generate its contradiction.
Desertions, refusal to fight, strikes and mutinies became widespread like
a social epidemic pushing proletarians under the uniform to unite, to fraternize
in order to face both armies. This is what happened in the swamps around
the Peninsula of Fao in the region of Basra as well as in the mountains
of the northeast of Iraq around the region of Halabja. The bourgeois' answer
was equal to the proletarian refusal to sacrifice themselves for a reason
that is not theirs: repression, imprisonment, shooting, kidnapping and
chemical bombing (1). This is what this dying world had to give to those
who didn't want anymore submit to its cannibalistic needs. This situation
could not last eternally. A peace between both belligerents was necessary
to pacify the proletarians from both sides of the border, even though the
epicenter of the discontent movement had henceforth moved from Iran towards
Iraq, where the regime of Saddam Hussein had difficulties keeping the anger
that rose against it and against the sacrifices that the disgusting homeland
had demanded from proletarians by now bloodless. The solution to maintain
this anger out of the social confrontation was quickly found: it was about
to divert this overflow of misery and rage towards one of the rich Iraqi
neighbors and to let the destitute satisfy their hate against the bourgeoisie
and its war, while participating as mercenaries in the depredation of the
rich Kuwait. We know what followed. Iraqi invasion of the emirate with
the blessing of the American state, which at the same time prepared to
bring the proletariat into line while setting up the greatest world coalition
never organized since World War II. This was the price for restoring order
in this region. The number one purpose of the bourgeois fraction that led
the Coalition was to put an end once and for all to all these proletarians
who, guns in their hands, challenged the authority of the exploiters since
a too long time. The second purpose was to get rid of Saddam Hussein and
his fraction, incapable to fully assume this task. In spite of the 500,000
warriors armed to the teeth and the great naval and aerial forces, the
Coalition was not able to seize Baghdad. Proletarians recovered their class
path again and returned their guns against their own officers. Basra, Baghdad,
Sulaymaniyah and other cities revolted against the bourgeoisie. There appeared
"shoras" or councils, organs of self-organization of our class, which as
a result ruined all the dreams of the Coalition and its war plans. Being
incapable of repressing this generalized insurrection, the Coalition let
the Kurdish nationalists in the north and Saddam Hussein in the rest of
Iraq do the dirty work. The Coalition gave the National Guard, which had
been miraculously spared by the aerial bombing, a free hand to start a
new slaughter against the insurgent proletarians.
<p>But in the history of class struggles there is neither coincidence nor
miracle. If the planes of the Coalition didn't unload their tons of deadly
bombs upon this army corps specialized in the maintenance of bourgeois
social order, it was because they knew that it could be necessary in case
of a massive rebellion. And the generalized insurrection confirmed that
this had been correct: the Republican Guard was indispensable. The world
bourgeoisie had certainly considered this scenario in its different plans.
Who pretends that our enemies are stupid? Unfortunately for us, they know
their general interests and it is often that they think in term of class.
It was necessary to leave Saddam Hussein in the government and to postpone
the bloody conquest plans established by the Pentagon and the UNO as well.
<p>The exploited paid heavily for having dared to rise up in arms and for
having prevented the most determined fraction of the world bourgeoisie
to restore order in Iraq under the mask of the Coalition. After the million
of deaths of the Iran-Iraq war and another million of deaths due to war,
aerial bombing and repression in 1991, the next 10 years were not softer
for our class brothers. A huge embargo was decided by this den of rascals
known as the UNO, killing slowly thousands of children. All in all, a new
million of deaths filled cemeteries. At the same time, the aerial bombing
didn't stop, but now under cover of humanitarian help. Day after day, the
embargo was strengthened with the help of the Anglo-American air force
that unloaded in Iraq, since 1991, almost the same amount of bombs than
in Germany during World War II. This allowed to Saddam Hussein and his
clique to strengthen their influence on the proletariat, since this could
not eat anything else than what the Iraqi government (with the help of
the UNO vultures) distributed under shape of rations, since the black market
was something terribly expensive for the miserable fellows. Hunger was
a terrifying weapon in the hands of the bourgeoisie that used and abused
of it in order to destroy and to submit our class brothers in struggle
in this region. In the north of the country, where Kurdish and Islamist
nationalists gave one another a helping hand in order to crush the proletariat,
the policy consisting in exchanging weapons for food was systematically
organized, with the blessing of the UNO, the USA and all the GNO on site.
This policy stuck every proletarian while putting him faced with the dilemma
to know if he had to leave his gun in order to eat, as cleverly recommended
by the whole humanitarists and other humanrightists on site, or if he had
to use his gun in order to seize by force what he and his prole need.
<p>After having starved and bombed proletarians during years, with the
complicity silence in the mass media, the strategists of the Pentagon declared
after the events of September 11th, 2001 that the time was come to put
an end to this problem of insecurity and subversion. A new invasion was
planned, following the Afghanistan one. The arrogance of those who nowadays
consider themselves to be the masters of the world is so unbelievable that
the US War Secretary, Donald Rumsfeld, told that with hardly a tenth of
the previous Coalition, he would parade in Baghdad in some weeks. Being
wiser, the military of the Pentagon sent a few 200,000 men into a coalition,
lesser widened than the one of 1991, even though behind the show of the
pair Chirac &amp; Schr&ouml;der and their partner Putin, the whole bourgeois
fractions of the planet had joined forces with US Marshal Bush about the
main purpose of this operation: to restore order in this region. None of
the exploiters were lacking in this war against the proletariat and none
of those who told so loudly their opposition towards this conflict made
nothing at all to prevent it. The show of this so-called opposition to
war didn't obviously prevent Chirac, in collaboration with the US troops,
to allow the B52 flying fortresses to fly over their aerial space and,
which from airfields in Britain took off in order to unload their tons
of bombs on the cities of Iraq and preferably on the working districts.
Meanwhile the German state that advocated a pacifist policy simply paid
millions of Euros in order to carry the police operation led by the Anglo-American
troops through to a successful conclusion. Tightrope walker's game that
allowed the SPD chancellor Schr&ouml;der to win the legislative elections
with his ecologist allies, riding on the pacifist wave that flooded at
that time in Europe, while taking a substantial part in the 230 millions
of dollars that the European Union sent in Iraq, under cover of humanitarian
help. As for Putin he received the authorization to also restore order
in Chechnya from the world policeman, who gave the Russian state terrorism
a free hand, in return for his diplomatic and military support towards
the second version of the Gulf war (2). Finally, the show against war could
not be complete without the scene of the endless votes of the UNO and the
media stands of its Secretary-General Koffi Annan, who at the same time
of the publication of his resolutions, prepared the invasion of Iraq planned
by the Pentagon while collecting top secret information under cover of
humanitarian help. This spying directly led by the UNO agents on site in
the framework of the aid policies towards civil populations, and directly
transmitted to the CIA, is nothing more today than an open secret.
<p>This second intervention in Iraq was not only a generalized war between
several capitalists confronting each other in order to conquer the world
and to eliminate their enemies in an out of control race, but also tremendously
looked like a police operation, as there happens every day in cities like
Sao Paulo or Rio de Janeiro, where death squadrons paid by rich tradesmen
liquidate youngsters and young proletarians called delinquents, allowing
thus to kill them more easily. As for these policemen in Brazil, the US
military was called to restore order at an upper level in a region where
social instability had become a too important problem. Beyond the different
approaches in the way to proceed, this was clearly the purpose of the world
state, all bourgeois fractions allied. Some, sure of their strength, wanted
to go there without any pressure of the UNO resolutions, others preferred
to go there under the blue banner of humanitarianism and "humanrightism",
while hoping to avoid in that way the dawn of a guerrilla warfare that
could destabilize the whole region; issue that in case of victory of the
invasion troops could definitely and socially destabilize the whole world.
This is the reason why, Chirac, Schr&ouml;der, Putin and Annan join forces
with the Bush staff, while secretly having hope to see the American republicans
to bite the dust and to be sent back in the parliamentary opposition at
the time of the American presidential elections. Their hope was that a
democrat becomes president and calms things down while pulling out all
the stops upon Iraq, but under the banner of the UNO. It is obvious that
this topic would deserve a more important development, but all this it
would go beyond the purpose of this short contribution.
<p>The fact is that this time, the military and the humanitarian had not
been mistaken. The police operation was efficiently managed; the four weeks
of conflict were a walkover, despite some difficulties and some 55,000
civilians killed under the disgusting name of "collateral damages". The
American troops had no hesitation in shooting at everything that was moving.
Orders had been obviously given from high places, encouraging to shoot
first and to verify afterwards.
<p>The Iraqi army and its special forces had suddenly disappeared from
the battle field, leaving the Anglo-American troops the way open in order
to enter in Baghdad. The relative ease of the invasion troops to go through
the whole country nearly without incident, from the south to the north,
proved only one thing: that proletarians in Iraq, mobilized, regimented,
knocked into shape in barracks and sent out to the front in order to sacrifice
their life on the altar of the homeland, these proletarians had refused
to make it. As during the war Iran-Iraq in the eighties, as during the
first Gulf war, the proletariat in Iraq set once again an example towards
its brothers all over the world, while refusing to fight in favor of its
own oppressors. Nobody emphasized this admirable attitude, according to
what we read on these events. This little "detail" tell us much more than
any analysis about proletariat's state of mind at that moment. This is
the reason why Saddam Hussein lost the war, not because of the treason,
either known or presumed, of his collaborators and his accomplices, but
simply because the cannon fodder of wars, the proletarians, usually so
docile, refused to fight, refused to die for interests that were not theirs.
Entire units thus dissolved themselves into a few minutes on the roadsides
while leaving badges, uniforms, officers, shoes, vehicles and tanks in
order to dress in civilian clothes again; but, and it is important to emphasize,
while taking care to keep their weapons. Thus, proletarians deserted, but
armed, and returned to their homes while waiting to see what was going
to happen.
<p>A second interesting event is to be emphasized, always in order to get
off the military, diplomatic and political episodes developed by the media
and without any interest for our analysis here: we refer to the way how
our class brothers greeted those who had pretentiously self-proclaimed
themselves to be the "liberators of the new Iraq". There were no great
joy outburst as Western Europe had known during the arrival of the Anglo-American
troops after the retreat of the German troops in 1945. Despite the brainwashing
of the GI's, the "liberators" met only a very few enthusiasm when they
arrived. It is with great suspicion that the local proletarians welcomed
the Anglo-American troops, still remembering very well that during decades
those who nowadays came "to free" them had supported Saddam Hussein. They
still remembered very clearly that in 1991, after having encouraged them
to rise up against Saddam, the current "liberators" had stopped their offensive
allowing thus the repression forces of this same Saddam to slaughter them.
The invasion troops had hardly gotten rid of the last pockets of resistance,
that thousands of proletarians swept into the streets, not in order to
applaud "their liberators", but on the contrary to loot everything that
could more or less represent the hated power of the Baath Party and Saddam
Hussein. And the damned of the earth didn't stop after such a good start.
The looting took place on a large scale: from the presidential palaces
to the barracks while passing by the ministries and even the residences
in the bourgeois areas as well as the mosques. One piece of evidence is
a call abundantly distributed by an obscure "Supreme Committee of the Islamic
Revolution", regrouping most of the imams, asking "with all humility to
the faithful to bring back everything that was looted". The imams explained
these events as "a moment of distraction" from the faithful. These sellers
of ideological opium forget that in 1991, the revolted proletarians in
Najaf and Karbala had sacked these whorehouses that they call "holy places".
This shows all the consideration that our class brothers feel for these
sellers of false paradise. In spite of the few information that filters
through this region, one can assert nowadays that very few looted objects
were restored; another proof about the current limits of the ascendancy
of these bourgeois forces - the Islamists - over the proletariat in Iraq.
<p>The occupying troops didn't prevent the looting, hoping probably to
calm the rage of the proletarians, and only preserved from depredations
the famous Department of oil and everything that is more or less connected
to it: oil well, pipelines, refineries, oil and shipping terminals, gasoline
depots, tank trucks, etc. The fraction regrouped around Bush junior would
please to do the dirty work, in order to serve the interests of capital
as a whole, but it doesn't forget its immediate interests bound to oil
and weapons; this issue tends towards to irritate its competitors that
don't forget to remind the Bush staff of their own interests. In order
to remain dialectical, it is only here that dissension between bourgeois
are to be found, dissension (overanalyzed by a whole of groups that claim
to adhere to social revolution) between the bourgeois of Halliburton and
BP (British Petroleum), those of Total-Elf-Fina, the Russian and Chinese
oil societies, which before the war did a deal of exclusive rights of exploitation
of the Iraqi mineral resources. Under cover of "respect of private property",
under cover of the "right of people" and other legal nonsense, Chirac and
consorts reminded the occupying troops that they could not let proletarians
attack with impunity the bourgeois and their property. A semblance of order
was restored with submachine-gun and when it was not enough, it is with
cannon that occupation troops recalled who was the master. But the American
leaders' arrogance was such that they didn't give themselves the means
in order to control a situation that already was beyond any control only
a few days after having conquered Baghdad indeed. Boosted by such an easy
victory, Donald Rumsfeld disbanded by decree not only the Baath Party and
the government of Saddam Hussein, but also the Iraqi army and even the
police, against the opinion of a whole of specialists in social pacification
(as Bernard Kouchner who was ready to "support the Americans" and to "begin
to serve free Iraq"). He thus provoked a gigantic chaos generalized by
the looting and the occupations of official buildings by hundreds of families
with no means of support. For all those who had believed in the occupying
forces' official speech about "new Iraq", the "end of dictatorship", "democracy"...,
the disillusion was definitely great.
<p>Convinced of an easy victory and with such a huge strike force at their
disposal, the US troops could not imagine at this moment that someone would
try to show signs of rebellion. At the Pentagon, the problems that looting
and chaos generated were considered as epiphenomenona and that order would
be quickly restored, once the power of the American army would have decided
to put an end in there. This is the reason why postwar had not been planned
by the strategists who had decided the invasion. They thought that after
the thrashing that the army of Saddam Hussein was going to get, everybody
would shut up and order would be restored. It was again without taking
into account the determination of proletarians not to let themselves be
pushed around. During the summer, demonstrations broke out almost everywhere
and very quickly turned into riots. As in Basra in August 10th and 11th,
2003 where several British soldiers are slaughtered by a crowd furious
to live under a new yoke and in a situation of misery that doesn't stop
increasing. The same reasons producing the same effects, thousands of proletarians
took to the streets in Falluja, Ramadi, Mossul while asking the occupying
forces to restore electricity, water, roads and food. In some few words,
everything that is necessary for surviving after a war. The only answer
of the Anglo-American troops was to arrest and to scatter the rioters with
automatic rifles. Here and there, some smarter regional commanders got
down to work in order to bring a minimum of infrastructures back into operation.
Very quickly, occupation troops are going to recognize to have jailed more
than 10.000 people for "breach of the peace". And nothing is enough in
order to pacify angry proletarians. Since early the year 2004, more and
more unemployed get organized in order to demonstrate through whole of
the country. Thus, the weekend of January 10th and 11th, 2004 in Amarah,
thousands of proletarians demonstrated asking for better living conditions
and ended up transforming their march into a riot, attacking those who
are responsible of their miserable situation: the town hall, the HQ of
the 1st battalion of British light infantry. The Iraqi policemen and the
English troops didn't be particular about details while firing into the
crowd: at least 6 people are known to have been killed and dozens others
injured as well.
<p>Whereas the official line of "new Iraq" was that all the evils afflicting
the Iraqi were due to the cupidity of Saddam's regime, the reality that
the proletariat every day lives is still worse today than under Saddam.
Often food starts running out, and this despite the enormous inflow of
merchandise being dumped onto big cities sidewalks since the frontiers
are reopened to the trade. There is no job and therefore there are no wages,
increasing thus the state of misery against which a great part of the population
struggles since several decades. Officially, the rate of unemployment is
currently close to 70% of the active population. The dissolution of the
army accelerated the process of pauperization while thousands of families
are stricken by the withdrawal of their wage. And this, even without speaking
about the destroyed infrastructures and the denationalizations/ privatizations
forcing always more proletarians to unemployment, to misery. No wonder
therefore, if some proletarians rise up in arms against the Anglo-American
troops and start using guerrilla warfare or even great scale social reappropriation
in order to survive. Sabotages of pipelines, attacks and looting of convoys,
bombing against GI's on patrol, against refineries, began to develop everywhere,
provoking in return reprisals, which are often indiscriminate, led with
always more violence and arrogance by the US troops and other occupying
forces. This situation provokes in turn a discontent and an always more
generalized rejection of the occupation troops. The targets show how local
proletarians refuse to docilely submit. Let's take a look for a while in
order to better understand what really happens in Iraq.
<p>Every day, there is information about the fact that an American soldier
stepped on a mine or was fired in an ambush. The same applies to local
policemen of the "new Iraq" who very often see their buildings taken as
one's target, and especially on payday, when they are all gathered. But
if the purpose is very understandable here, it's the same for other attacks
currently led against what more or less can represent the fact to bring
the proletarians of this region to heel. Let's recall that one of the first
attacks was led against the Jordan embassy on August 7th, 2003. One will
be warned later, during the month of October, that the Jordanian state,
with the discreet help of the French and German secret service, had received
the unrewarding job to contribute in the international division of labor
for restoring order in the region, while forming 30,000 policemen during
hardly 8 weeks of training course. No wonder if these buildings were targeted
for a bombing. On August 19th, the UNO headquarters is targeted, killing
its leader in Iraq Sergio Vieira de Mello and most of his collaborators
as well. There is no need to recall that the proletarians hate this world
institution, which organized starvation during years, and is currently
taking part with full forces in restoring order in Iraq. Ten days later,
on August 29th, it is the turn of the leader of the Supreme Council of
the Islamic Revolution in Iraq, the ayatollah Al Hakim, to be murdered
in an attempt in Najaf. On September 2nd, new attempt against the police
HQ in Baghdad, damaging the office of his chief Hassan Ali. On September
20th, Akita Al Hachimi, very known Baathist working with Tarek Aziz at
the State Department of Saddam Hussein, is murdered after being nominated
by the USA on September 2nd as a member of the Iraqi provisional authority.
On September 18th, new attack against the refinery of Bajdji, the greatest
of the country, holding up the oil exportation for several days. On September
23rd, new attempt against the UNO headquarters that, despite Koffi Annan's
speech announcing the departure of his men after the first attempt, still
had let more than 4,000 civil servants, most of them from Iraqi origin,
in order to continue to make their pacification dirty work. On October
10th, murder of Jos&eacute; Antonio Bernal, staff sergeant in the Spanish
airforce but actually agent of the Spanish intelligence service (CNI).
Seven other intelligence agents will be killed some weeks later, on November
29th, forcing Aznar's government to close its embassy and to repatriate
a whole of civilians and diplomats who also worked for the country pacification.
On October 12th, a car bomb exploded before the Baghdad hotel that mainly
accommodates CIA members, Iraqi provisional government members, as well
as a whole of American businessmen coming to do "a bit of business" at
the expense of our class brothers' misery. On October 23rd, as the Pentagon
wants to call in the Turkish army to come to subdue the rebellion in Iraq,
a car bomb exploded before the Turkish embassy. On October 27th, Paul Wolfowitz,
the Pentagon number two after Donald Rumsfeld, just escaped death. Several
rockets came to crash on the facade of Al Rachid hotel where he stayed.
On November 3rd, three explosions stroke the HQ of the American army in
Baghdad. On November 12th, explosion of a bomb before the court of Rassafa
at the East of Baghdad. Since then, several judges have been murdered.
On November 21st, rocket attack against the Department of oil and against
the Sheraton hotel where an American civilian (3) working for Halliburton
has been seriously injured. In December, one heard that Paul Bremer, the
person in charge for social pacification in Iraq, had escaped until now
two attempts. And Friday December 19th, it is the turn of Ali Al-Zalimi,
a high leader of the Baath Party, responsible for the repression of the
1991 uprising, to be lynched by demonstrators in Najaf (4).
<p>We could indefinitely lengthen this list, but this would not add anything
to what we said above; the whole apparatus, services, organs, the local
representatives of the world state are systematically targeted. Far from
being indiscriminate, these acts of armed resistance are logical if we
make the effort to get a little bit off stereotypes and ideological brainwashing
that the bourgeois put forward as only explanation for what happens in
Iraq. Through the targets, as well as in the daily guerrilla warfare led
against the occupation forces, one can make out the windings of a proletariat
that tried to struggle, to get organized against the whole bourgeois fractions
that decided to restore capitalist order and security in the region, even
though it is still extremely difficult to appreciate the autonomy of our
class towards the bourgeois forces that try to control the anger, the rage
of our class against everything that more or less represents the world
state. Acts of sabotage, bombing, demonstrations, occupations and strikes
are not the fact of Islamists or Pan-Arabic nationalists. This interpretation
would be too easy and would go in the way of the dominant speech that wants
to absolutely trap our understanding into a struggle between "good and
evil", between "the good and the bad guys", a bit as in a western movie,
disposing once again of capitalism deadly contradiction: the proletariat.
<p>Here is a better example about what proletariat is living as contradiction.
It happens in Duluya, a small city in the north of Baghdad in the famous
"Sunnite Triangle". Since they occupy the city, at the end of March 2003,
the Americans must regularly face shootings against their troops and their
convoys. As a reaction, they decided to raze several thousands of date
palms running along the roads of the region. It is rumored that a mysterious
Baathist organization would be behind these attacks. At least that's what
is said in the Arabic papers, whereas the Israeli newspaper Ha'aretz has
another version about these mysterious attacks: they would be the deed
of "young people with nothing to do" who for about 1,000 or 1,500 dollars
paid by Islamist organizations would organize the attack against the US
troops. And the newspaper to quote one of these youngsters: "It's the best
way today to earn one's living in Iraq." As if by chance, since the occupation
troops razed the date palms, in order to fight the insurgents, and that
dozens of farm workers have been deprived of their livelihood, the attacks
against the GI's didn't decrease, but on the contrary increased.
<p>Everything will be settled in the months to come. Will proletarians,
who are very strongly against the whole world fractions of capitalism,
be strong enough for not sinking into radical Islamism or Pan-Arabism that,
with the capture of Saddam Hussein (Sunday December 14th), seems to be
on a roll? Will our brothers in Iraq be strong enough for not getting bogged
down in a popular war of national liberation? The answer cannot come only
from the local proletariat that, as long as it will remain so dramatically
isolated in its struggle, will have difficulty not falling into one or
another bourgeois fractions' arms, which try to enroll our class as cannon
fodder under one of its banners. It will depend on the balance of power
between proletariat and bourgeoisie at the most global level, at the world
level, and especially in the native countries of the occupation troops.
And there we must state the fact that unfortunately this balance is not
in our favor, even though we get a breath of fresh air from here and there,
from Bolivia, Peru, etc. The responsibility of our class brothers through
the world, and more especially in the USA, in England, in Poland, in Spain,
in Italy... react, get restless, get organized and refuse to act as cannon
fodder, turning this war into social war against their own bourgeoisie.
<p>However nothing important is happening in those centers of international
repression. The proletariat in the United States is bogged down in a deep
patriotism condensed in the famous slogan "support our boys"; completed
for the "most critical" with a sheep-like crusade calling to dumb pacifism.
It is necessary to emphasize in this context, and against the current,
some interesting reactions that took place on the west coast of the United
States, just when war was triggered off. Also during these demonstrations,
some proletarians had brandished a banner asserting: "we support our troops
when they shoot their officers", thumbing its nose at the government's
official slogan calling to "support our troops".
<p>But if the diversion of this official watchword appears sympathetic
and show us the way to follow in the struggle of the proletariat, we have
also to admit that the attitude expressing with force the lifelong position
of our class -i.e. revolutionary defeatism- unfortunately remains terribly
isolated into a swamp where pacifism is next to the flattest third-worldism.
Even among GI's parents associations, in the forefront of the struggle
against war in Iraq, they had all count on the democrat party to come to
power at the last presidential elections in order to "bring back our children
home" rather than on a direct action against the army that sends them to
"smash Arabs". Within the US army, whereas the contradiction always becomes
stronger between the formation for soldier's profession and the prosaic
reality to be nothing but a cop sent all over the world in order to repress
the destitute having the same social background, only a few give up becoming
mercenaries.
<p>This is not the 1,500 military who deserted or refused going to kill
in Iraq that can tip the scales in our favor. Let's recall that at the
time of the war in Vietnam they were officially more than 200,000! This
is not either the courageous declarations, in the middle of patriotic hysteria
imposed in the USA since September 11th bombing, of some deserters who
are very clearly claiming their refusal to kill civilians, that are going
to change things about the catastrophic submission situation in which the
proletariat in this country is today in relation to its own bourgeoisie.
The same applies to the other states dispatching troops in Iraq and that,
for the meantime, don't meet with no real opposition against that.
<p>But we can be sure that the bloody occupation of Iraq is not finished;
the American and allied troops will have to remain there for still a long
time and this quagmire that begins to look like the Vietnam one is going
to certainly oblige the Pentagon to send always more troops in order to
face the increasing number of attacks (5).
<p>"We lack means to assess if we win or lose the world battle against
terrorism. My impression is that we didn't make today any decisive progress."
Donald Rumsfeld wrote in his memorandum for the US Congress, November 14th,
2003.
<p>At the last count there were more than 1,200 deaths since the beginning
of this conflict, without speaking about those who are in secret mission
(undercover) and who are discreetly buried in the desert (several tombs
have been lately discovered). Injured are more than 15,000 despite the
protections in Kevlar that most of the soldiers carry and the immediate
undertaking of the injured by specialized teams. This means more than ten
injured every day, of which most are seriously wounded. As the American
neo-conservative newspaper "The New Republic" noted: "The media has always
treated combat deaths as the most reliable measure of battlefield progress,
while for its part the administration has been reluctant to divulge the
full number of wounded."
<p>Never since the Vietnam, the US Army had to face such a large number
of injured. Bodies that are sent back home overnight within cargo aircraft
in order to avoid television cameras and demoralization of the troops staying
home. Suicides into the enlisted troops is increasing day after day, although
the figures in this respect are not released, and the number of soldiers
officially sent back home for "mental health problems" (soldiers who did
a slow burn) amounted to 478 in September 2003. Let's also recall that
the number of attacks against the law and order troops is close to 70 to
75 each day, and that most of the troops are there since nearly two years.
It's getting a long time and begins to displease the troops who "don't
understand anymore the reason why they are there". Let's add the inability
of the Pentagon to replace them because a lack of soldiers, and we have
here a cocktail that becomes more and more explosive for the bourgeois
fraction that is establishing itself as the world police.
<p>Do we have to see in all this the forerunner of a possible breach in
the national unity, a breach of a similar nature to the one during the
war in Vietnam 40 years ago, while huge cracks have appeared within the
American society? At that time, the only hope for a soldier avoiding to
be terribly wounded or killed, was to oppose by all means his involvement
into war. And these child's play means consisted above all in avoiding
any confrontation with the enemy. While practicing the "fragging", which
means "killing an officer with a grenade", soldiers who were against war
provoked such a terror among their officers that these no longer dared
to send them to the battlefield, losing this way the control upon their
troops. In 1970, the Pentagon published the figures of 65,643 deserters,
that is to say is the equivalent of 4 infantry divisions! Other interesting
figures are the existence of more than 300 clandestine newspapers against
war directly published by soldiers and that greatly contributed to breaking
the isolation, while generalizing the opposition to war. Daily demonstrations
in the USA, sabotages, strikes and building occupations really prevented
the continuation of war. Thus, in the early seventies, the American government
had to put a brake on its commitment in Vietnam and to withdraw its troops
little by little. While remembering these significant facts about the horrible
nightmare the bourgeois lived at that time, we can see that there's nowadays
a huge gulf between this period of struggle and us, but we can also show
the only way that will put an end to this slaughter.
<p>Our conclusion can only be temporary. We tried in these few lines to
catch the events that take place there under our eyes, while trying to
leave the journalistic categories that can certainly not grasp the complex
reality of what takes place over there. To continue speaking about Shiites,
Sunnis, Kurds, Baathists, Islamists, about such or such tribe, such or
such clan, this is erasing the essential contradiction that pushes capital
to try to restore order in a region disturbed since several decades by
a combative proletariat and that doesn't yet accept to submit to the dictatorship
of the economy. We can only repeat the call to our friends, readers and
the whole comrades, so that they consider the struggle led by our class
brothers in Iraq as their own. We will be able to break their isolation
only while generalizing our struggles against our own bourgeoisie, where
we are living in, and while taking a hard line with our program and our
class purposes. Only revolutionary defeatism can shake this society to
a significant extent, society that doesn't have another project than to
accumulate mountains of skeletons, and can make the decisive breaches towards
its violent destruction.

<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">Notes</font></u></h3>
1. Bourgeoisie's cynicism has no limit and is equal to its state of putrefaction.
Whereas, still yesterday, these chemical bombing with their thousands of
deaths were in practice organized, supported and financed by the whole
bourgeois fractions (and in the first place: the German state for gas supplies
and the French state for the airplanes), nowadays these same states denounce
and rejects these bombing as "excesses" made by the individual Saddam Hussein
and his henchman Ali, aka the chemical.
<p>2. It is also necessary to emphasize the Russian help for the invasion,
which consisted in providing the Pentagon with the plans of the Iraqi military
facilities as well as the tactics that the Iraqi army could use; since
as government officials of the former USSR they had built and trained the
army of this country.
<p>3. It is necessary to emphasize that everywhere when it is speaking
about civilians, with regard to the occupation forces, the directly repressive
functions of many of these mercenaries are hidden, mercenaries who are
recruited in order to be useful for the occupation. The occupation army
itself is recruiting, for the completion of its purposes, a whole of private
companies that provide the occupying forces with guards specialized in
interrogations (i.e. torturers), with bodyguards; besides it is clear that
the different unofficial police forces (i.e. death squads) are using the
"civil" cover as everywhere in the world.
<p>4. This article has first been published in our central review in French
(February 2004). From then till the publication of this text in our review
in Spanish (September 2004), the situation for the occupying forces didn't
stop worsening. The attacks, demonstrations, looting and occupations, became
widespread, both massively and geographically. The resistance spread, at
the present time, throughout the whole regions of Iraq. Nowhere in this
country, those who more or less represent the world state and who want
to impose the capitalistic social order, are in a safe place: the occupation
troops, the local soldiers and even the mercenaries of all kind, the Kurdish
nationalists and even the Iraqi politicians, including the high dignitaries
of the "New Independent Iraq", no matter they are laymen or members of
the religious hierarchy, all of them know that they can be eliminated at
any time.
<p>5. What obviously doesn't rule out that the Pentagon itself and generally
the American state, next to many others, is expecting on medium-term on
the preparation of a more international repression force, with a better
pacifist cover provided by those who opposed the war and therefore with
a greater humanitarian legitimacy, supported by the UNO.
