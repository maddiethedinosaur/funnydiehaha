The proletariat, in its tendency to organize itself as an autonomous class,
needs to meet, to develop its press, to unite, to carry on strikes, to
occupy factories, to organize direct action, to liberate confined comrades,
to get arms. These tasks have been assumed with different results in all
bourgeois periods of its historic fight, independent of the type of bourgeois
domination: Bonapartist or parliamentary, republican or fascist.
<p>The bourgeoisie's policy toward the proletariat consists in showing
these needs as identical to all democratic institutions and liberties (free
press, free association, amnesty,...). It is not only the classical liberal
bourgeois who try to convince us that democracy is the best, but also all
the pseudo-working-class parties (socialist, Stalinist, Trotskyist,...)
which base their counter-revolutionary policy on the statement that the
working- class will reach socialism through the conquest and the defence
of all those rights and liberties.
<p>In fact, there is a basic opposition between the mass of bourgeois democratic
liberties and the needs of the proletariat to get organized on its own
class field. The positions the proletariat conquers in this field can never
be confused with so-called "working-class liberties".
<p>In the same way as two opposite classes exist, there are two fundamental
conceptions of workers' struggle. One is bourgeois, where one criticizes
the lack of equality, of democracy, where one should fight for more rights
and liberties. The other is proletarian, based on an understanding of the
fact that the roots of all those liberties, rights and equalities are essentially
of anti-worker type. This leads to the total practical destruction of the
democratic State with its equality, rights and liberties. These two opposite
conceptions show the contradiction between, on one hand, passive criticism
- to improve, reform, and in this way, reiinforce the exploitation system
- and, on the other hand, active criticismm, our criticism - the destruction
of that exploitation system.
<p>When the "right" tells us that the "left" is dictatorial and anti-democratic,
that when the "left" reaches the government it does not respect the human
rights and that our interest is therefore to wave the flag of democracy,
to fight under its protection for pure democracy, is it a myth or do they
have an objective interest in democracy? When the "left" tells us in the
name of "Marxism" that the "bourgeoisie" and "capitalism" do not respect
democratic liberties, that we have to defend them against fascist attacks,
that we have to crave them wherever they do not exist, that this is the
way to socialism, is it only a mass of opportunistic slogans or are they
really fighting for democracy?
<p>The bourgeoisie always tried to use the proletariat (taken as atomized
workers, as "citizen") as a social basis, as slaves to serve its own dominant
class interests. In this way, we already understand how the bourgeoisie
always tries to make the workers fight for a different interest than their
own (this partly answers the question). But do the bourgeoisie of left
and right want democracy or not? The tale of liberties and human rights,
is it only a mystification without any material basis or is there an objective
reality that produces this democratic mystification? Do we have to infer
that no bourgeois faction has any interest in having these rights and liberties
of the citizens applied? (The corollary of this would be that the proletariat
could avoid the bourgeoisie's domination if it really fought for the defence
of democracy). Or do we have to conclude to the contrary that the fight
of capitalists for the paradise of democratic rights is really the supreme
will of the bourgeoisie.
<p>Of course, the revolutionary marxist criticism we develop here is based
on this last thesis: the mass of human rights and liberties correspond
exactly to <u>the ideal form</u> of the reproduction of capitalist oppression.
Let's see what this ideal form of democracy is and where it comes from.
<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+2>The paradise of human rights
and liberties</font></font></u></h2>
The party of order, the general party of Capital, or in other words, all
the bourgeois parties, is totally unable to face the proletariat organized
as a class and therefore as a party. This is why that main secret of capitalist
domination is to stop the organization of the proletariat as an autonomous
force and there is nothing more efficient for the bourgeoisie than the
mass of human rights and liberties to drown the working-class, to dissolve
it in the false concept of the "people". When the proletariat stops existing
as a class, when each worker is a good citizen, with his liberties, rights
and duties, he accepts all the rules of the game that atomize him and drown
him in the mass where his specific class interests disappear. As a good
citizen, he does not exist as a class, this is <u>the</u> condition for
democracy to work.
<p>But the reign of democracy as both "left" and "right" promise in the
name of socialism and/or liberty, where there would be no classes but just
citizens and free people, like any ideological form of the bourgeoisie
does not come from nowhere and does not remain just as a pure idea outside
the real world. On one hand, this world, "earthly paradise" of human rights,
obeys a very precise material reality: the reign of the circulation of
commodities from which all the defenders of Capital draw their principles
and conclusions; on the other hand, all the mental forms, ideologies, which
derives from this reign are accepted by society and are therefore objective.
The dissolution of the working-class in the dead world of citizenship is
nothing immaterial, even if it is based on the mystical world of commodities.
One could think that the millions of pages written by marxologists and
other capitalist lawyers,... the capitalist State constitutions, the charts,
the speeches,... only passively serve the bourgeoisie, that it takes them
into account or not according to circumstances. But this vision forgets
that these very papers reflect and strengthen reality, that they belong
to dominant ideology, which becomes <u>a material force</u> that reinforces
and reproduces the whole social system. The laws and other official papers
are just ideological products of capitalist dictatorship which have the
task of defending it.
<p>In the sphere of circulating commodities there are no classes; everybody
is a citizen, everybody appears as a buyer and seller of commodities, <u>equal,
free, and owner</u>. <b>Even when we sell our labour-power, we are in the
paradise of human rights and liberties. Each one is aiming at his own private
interests in the reign of <u>equality, liberty, and private property</u>.</b>
<p><u>Liberty</u>: because the buyer and the seller of commodities (including
labour-power) does not obey any rule than their own <u>free</u> will.
<p><u>Equality</u>: because in the world of commodities, everybody is a
buyer and a seller, and everybody gets a value <u>equal</u> to the value
contained in the commodities he is selling, exchanging equivalent against
equivalent.
<p><u>Property</u>: because each one appears, in the world of exchange
as an <u>owner</u> of his commodity and he can only dispose of what belongs
to him.
<p>As <u>free and equal owners</u>, all citizens contract relationships
giving rise to a natural brotherhood, which is the lawful reflection that
guarantees liberties, equality and the identical possibility for each man
to own commodities. Any buying or selling of commodity is the result of
free will, a contract between men who, because of commodity, are owners,
free, equal and like brothers.
<p>It is this fetishised world of commodities, where there is no place
for classes but only for men and citizens, that brings about the rights
and liberties that enable them to decide on the regulation and improvement
of this world. It is not only authorized to vote and to choose as a citizen,
but it is also possible to have one's delegates in democratic organs for
which the liberty of gathering, press, association, expression, etc. are
guaranteed. The citizens can associate as electors and elected (in the
bourgeois parties) or as buyers and sellers of commodity (in the trade-unions).
Nothing is more natural for the citizens than to found political parties,
to try to work in the government, in the ministries, the parliaments, or
the "soviets". No need for any nobility certificate as a citizen, anyone,
whatever his social position (of which the laws never speak) can become
a deputy, a minister or a president. In the same way, as buyers or sellers
of commodities, they can associate, form unions, refuse to buy or sell
if the deal is not good enough. To this corresponds another mass of rights
and liberties as the ones which rule private societies and the pseudo-workers'
trade-unions. The buyers and sellers of labour-power, associated as such
(never as workers or as capitalists, since nobody owns anybody else's work
in
the world of circulation of commodities) can even interrupt the delivery
of the use-value: it is the liberty of strike. In the same way, the citizen
who buys this commodity can decide to buy another one, it is the liberty
of work. Or the citizen can decide to stop buying this commodity: it is
the liberty of industry (under this reign, there is no lock-out). Let us
not forget the rights of prisoners, nor general amnesty, which can only
exist on condition that everybody behaves himself as a good citizen, a
good buyer and a good seller, as "Amnesty International" and other humanists
say.
<p>Some people will point out that nowhere such rights and liberties can
be found, that everywhere there are prisoners, everywhere the right to
strike is limited, that in this country the right of property is limited
and that in that country only one party is allowed, etc. All this is obvious.
Nevertheless, in all these countries, there is a faction of the bourgeoisie
that will criticize the lack of democracy of different governments, and
to do so, it must have a democratic ideal as reference. This is exactly
what we want to explain and denounce.
<p>It is the only way to break with the bourgeois criticism of democracy
and to recognize the enemy in all the defenders of a <u>pure and perfect
democracy</u>. Indeed, as well as democracy being the product and the reflection
of the mercantile basis of capitalist society, it is also the reference
of all bourgeois criticisms which only aim at correcting the imperfections
of democracy and where all the forces of counter-revolution concentrate
in periods of revolutionary crisis.
<p>But is it possible that the bourgeois ideology could really imagine
such a society, where there would be no prisoners because no-one would
steal because no worker's group would organize itself, where any strike
would be strictly legal, where any association would group buyers and sellers
to make sure the commodities would be exchanged at the right price? Of
course, yes. More than two hundred years ago the democrats had no problem
in recognizing that the democratic republic should correspond to the "people
of gods" as Rousseau said. Today the bourgeoisie, in its decomposition,
is still unable to understand the limits of its historical perspective
and holds on to its mystical ideas. If it found the need and the capacity
to integrate all the religion it used to fight yesterday in the name of
science, how can we doubt that it does not "honestly" long for the democratic
paradise it has always fought for?
<p>Man imagines god as a perfect image of himself, purified from all his
contradictions. Capital imagines a perfect and everlasting reign because
it is convinced that it is the positive pole of society, also purified
from its contradictions (wealth/misery, growth/obstacles to the development
of productive forces, "development"/"under-development", equality/oppression).
It sees itself as identical to its positive pole (wealth, growth, equality,
liberty, democracy,...) For example, it has a completely a-historical and
mystical conception of the valorization of Capital, as if it could exist
without periodical massive destructions of social productive forces. Even
if it calls itself socialism or communism, Capital always builds its own
categories, its own analysis, its own vision of the world, ignoring the
<u>unity</u>
and the <u>deadly contradiction</u> between wage-labour and Capital. One
can therefore not be surprised that in this democratic world, no one is
exploited, no one is imprisoned, that one can find only capital, wealth,
equality, justice, growth and liberty.
<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+2>The contradictory unity of
reality</font></font></u></h2>
Let us now leave the world of ideas and of capitalist categories, of circulation
and of citizenship, and let us return to the everyday world, the one of
production and of Capital's valorization. The seller of labour-power is
a <u>worker</u>, whether he believes in god or in democracy. In the factory
he is nobody's equal, he is free of nothing, owner of nothing, not even
of what he manipulates. If he wants, the worker can imagine that his citizenship
is only interrupted, that his equalities, liberties and properties have
been left in the cloak-room and that he will get them back when he gets
out. But he is completely wrong. In his eight (or more) hours of work,
he consumes raw material and machines to produce use-value that remains
the property of Capital and in the other sixteen hours, during his holidays,
he consumes food, beer, football or television to produce another use-value:
his labour-power, which will be used in valorizing Capital. Outside of
the mystical and ephemeral paradise of circulation and of free elections,
the worker remains a worker, whether he likes it or not; even when he fucks
(whether by pleasure or to produce a family) he is only a labour-power
that valorizes Capital. <u>As such, he is neither equal, nor free, nor
citizen, nor owner at any moment of his life. He is only a paid slave</u>.
Even before he tries to organize himself to defend his worker's interests,
he has already <u>all equality, property and liberty against him.</u>
<p>But to penetrate the real meaning of the mass of bourgeois rights and
liberties, one must not only shift from the circulation sphere to the production
sphere (in their contradictory unity) but also reach the essence of the
class contradictions in the society. In this way we understand that the
first liberty of the proletariat is to be free from all property. In fact,
the ancestors of the proletariat have been liberated by physical violence
of any other property than that of their children and of their own labour-power.
This liberty of all properties is the most important one. It determines
all the other ones. Thanks to this liberty the proletariat is only free
to sell his labour-power, but also free to die of hunger (he and his children),
if he does not find a buyer. The equality under the reign of circulation
of commodities gives the worker the right to receive a value equal to the
one of his labour-power and it is precisely this equality that takes away
from him the product of his own work and warrants capitalist exploitation.
Brotherhood is not a meaningless bourgeois slogan. It means, practically,
the brotherhood of the bourgeois against the proletariat; under the form
of national and democratic fraternity, it helps in tying the hands and
feet of workers to their exploiters and bringing them to the massacre of
their class-brothers on imperialist battle-fields.
<p>True liberty, property and fraternity of democracy implies therefore
a permanent situation of anti-proletarian violence. Repression is one of
the indispensable elements of imposition, reproduction and extension of
democracy. A long time ago, Marx used to denounce the sacred trinity "Liberty,
Equality, Fraternity" as equivalent to "Infantry, Cavalry, Artillery".
Even more, the tendency to reach the paradise of pure democracy -where
no one would complain of this liberty, equality, fraternity, property -
implies a higher level of realization of democracy, which also implies
the full use of the terror machine of the democratic State in its various
forms. Therefore, for example, there is no organic change between the liberal
and the fascist form of State, but only a process of purification of the
State in its tendency to reach an inaccessible democracy.
<p>Let us examine some other democratic rights and liberties. The right
of election means that every 4, 5, 6, 7,... years, the worker can dress
as a citizen to go and choose his oppressors freely. That supposes of course,
on one hand a free electoral campaign, that means the liberty for each
bourgeois faction to invest in it following its means and, on the other
hand, the liberty for others to imagine that society might change with
the coming of such or such party at the head of the bourgeois government.
The so-called rights and liberties even give the workers the "privilege"
to choose between the self-named "worker parties": to choose the one that
will be the most capable of directing the State of Capital and to organize
the massacre of the proletarians who would tend to ignore the directives
of the big "worker" parties and who would refuse what the majority has
decided.
<p>The liberty of press and propaganda simply insures the free market in
such a way that only the economic potential and the financial capacity
of the different parties would assume the control and domination of public
opinion and would guarantee the free application of the majority principle.
In front of this economico-political apparatus of the dominant class, the
workers have as alternative: either the liberty, right and duty to resign
themselves, or the force and the will to organize themselves as a class,
for which no right or liberty will ever be conceded.
<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+2>The so-called "workers' liberties"</font></font></u></h2>
"We theoretically agree that democracy is the domination system of bourgeoisie"
so would the socialists, the Stalinists, the Trotskyists, etc. answer:
"but what we must do now is to fight for the rights and liberties that
serve the organization of the working-class: the right of association,
of union action, of strike, of amnesty for political prisoners,... wherever
these rights do not exist, and to defend them each time fascism attacks
them". "What you don't understand," they would say, "is that we cannot
fight for socialism without these rights."
<p>Evidently, all these capitalist parties generally hide that "theory"
- until last Judgement Day when they will  all brandish it again - but let
us examine the practice of the rights and liberties contained in the program
these so-called parties call "minimum" or "transitional" (of all these
rights we will only examine those that are supposed to be "workers' rights").
<p>"The rights of reunion, of association, of unionism, the liberty of
press are rights granted to the workers, they are conquests of the working-class".
So speaks the bourgeoisie (of left and right). After having produced value
everyday for Capital, wearing out their force, their arms, their brains,
their sweat, their blood,... their lives, the workers do not only have
the right to go and watch football or get drunk at the bar to divert themselves,
to be in a good shape and be good at work the next day, but also, the bourgeoisie
gives them the right to discuss, to unionize and to send "delegates" to
negotiate the price at which they will sell themselves. It is very logical
that a seller tries to sell his commodity at high price and Capital admits
that the trade-unions change unreasonable claims of the workers into "righteous
salary claims". These "righteous claims" are those that permit an increase
in the exploitation rate, big enough to compensate the tendency of the
rate of profit to fall. And it is even considered "legitimate" by all the
bourgeoisie as long as it does not touch the national economy. There is
no doubt that the trade-unions are the best specialists to formulate these
"rights" and "legitimate" claims that do not hit the profit of Capital.
<p>What else can we find in these rights granted by the bourgeoisie? NOTHING,
absolutely nothing more.
<p>In front of a real workers' association defending the workers' interests,
fighting for a real reduction of work time, for a real increase in relative
wages, Capital has no interest in accepting the right of association, of
reunion, of press, of unionization, because these rights would necessary
attack the profit rate and the national economy. And then, democracy would
not have any other alternative than to use its cops, union troops,... The
parties never hesitate in using white terror against the workers' class
movement, and always in the name of democracy and liberty, of the right
to work, of the respect of the trade-union's decisions... Without any doubt,
the same thing will happen every time the workers' association will become
a school for communism, every time the question of socialism will stop
being a question of words and a struggle will be carried on, not only for
the increase in wages, but for the abolition of wage-labour.
<p>It must be very clear that workers' associations, their press, their
reunions and actions,... that are based solely on the immediate and historical
interests of the proletariat, must fight openly against Capital and its
national economy. And in the name of the respect of legal unions, of the
struggle against subversion, of unity against provocateurs, of the defence
of national security, <u>these so-called liberties</u> are precisely what
will be used as a repressive force against the class organizations.
<p>And this practice is very coherent with democracy. Repression is democratic
because it strikes when the workers leave their uniform of citizenship
to act as a class, when they stop accepting being a well disciplined army
for the valorization of Capital, for which the bourgeoisie had given them
these rights and liberties.
<p>This proves that contrary to what the bourgeoisie says, no right is
granted to the working-class when it acts as a class. These rights are
only granted to citizens, sellers of commodities. Repression of all those
who do not accept to behave as good citizens is the logical answer to the
bourgeois desire for a democratic paradise. There is no democratic paradise
for those who do not respect democracy. As soon as the proletariat organises
as a class, tries to attack the Capital dictatorship, democracy shows its
terrorist face; as long as its dictatorship holds on firmly, democracy
can show its liberal face to the stupid mass. The nice face of rights and
liberties is therefore reserved only for the citizen, the one who bows
down peacefully in front of the daily violence of the capitalist production
system: wage-labour.
<p>The same thing happens with the right to strike. The left wing of the
bourgeoisie tells us that it is antagonistic to the capitalist juridical
superstructure. No right is ever given to the class, to the workers in
their struggle, they are only given to the sellers of commodities. As long
as workers continue to accept simply being a force for Capital's valorization
they have all the rights to act as any seller of commodities: to claim
the right value for their commodity, to refuse to sell, to stop delivering
use-value, etc. And of course, on the other hand, we find the rights of
the buyer: the liberty of work (which means unemployment, strikebreaking,
lock out, etc.)... With this liberty, workers are the ones who remain everyday
more exploited, and more enslaved.
<p>And when they make a true strike without caring for any right or liberty,
when they really attack the bourgeois interests, no right or liberty exists
any more; they are accused of being provocateurs, or agents coming from
abroad,..., the true class strike is declared <u>illegal, wildcat, anti-union</u>,...which
in fact it is. Consciously or not, any class struggle fights <u>against</u>
the legality of the reign of commodity and fights for its destruction.
<p>And to do so, it cannot accept workers behaving like sheep, nor scabs,
nor unions, nor the right to work, nor the right to strike. On the battlefield,
when the workers use direct action against the trade-unions at the service
of Capital, they have no right at all. One must be blind or naive to believe
that the legalization of strikes, which does not come from us but from
our enemies, gives us any guarantee of winning or protects us against State
repression. On the contrary, the legalization of strikes is a way for the
bourgeoisie to reduce the class strength of strikes.
<p>Another example is the "amnesty for political prisoners" requested by
Amnesty as well as by all the social-democrats, pacifists, Trotskyists,
humanists, priests of any imperialist side, but only at the condition they
are made prisoners by a State of the other imperialist side. Each State
keeps its own prisoners and, at the same time, asks for the liberation
of its neighbour's in the name, of course, of human rights.. Besides, the
humanists only claim to care for political prisoners at a time when international
conventions such as the "European Juridical Space" relegate all actions
of proletarian violence to the rank of "common law delinquency".
<p>The height of their campaign, is that they all - committees for Chilean,
Argentinean, Salvadorian exiles, support groups for RAF, the IRA, etc.
- aim at getting the signatures of humanisst social-democracies such as
the German one, which does not retain many political prisoners since it
has already eliminated most of them one by one. And just as in any imperialist
war, each State is ready to negotiate some human flesh against investments
or commodities. And they keep talking about "amnesty" and "human rights".
In this obvious trade of human flesh, the bourgeoisie cleverly puts together
all prisoners, concealing the class character of the imprisonment of our
comrades who were caught while fighting the bourgeois State. When a junta
gets evicted, when a new president takes office, when such or such a party
wins the elections, then they allow a "wide popular amnesty". And they
pretend that the best way to show solidarity with our imprisoned comrades
would be to collect signatures from democrats, to participate -by sending
donations and telegrams- in the campaigns organised by "Amnesty", the parties,
the parliamentary governments,... We know that all this confusion is the
exact opposite to the solidarity needed by all our imprisoned comrades.
The only solidarity is class solidarity, which does not exist through humanist
speeches, nor through the game of human rights on the side of the USA,
the USSR or Cuba and which cannot be obtained by protest letters addressed
to capitalist butchers asking them to torture a little bit less. But it
exists through <u>the struggle against the bourgeoisie in each country</u>.
Only the direct action of the working-class with its own means (strikes,
sabotage of the national production,...) will allow to impose its strength,
to liberate the present workers who are imprisoned, but also to lay down
the basis to organize class power, the proletarian dictatorship that will
blow away the history of all States and all prisoners.
<p>As with all other rights and liberties, the legal amnesty has nothing
to do with workers' struggle to free comrades from jails, because as long
as the capitalist exploitation system lasts, there will be prisoners and
particularly, proletarian prisoners. One must not only know that there
is no legal guarantee against prison and torture, but also that prison
and torture will always be used in the name of the defence of these rights
and liberties. In the same way that, under capitalism, every worker is
potentially unemployed, any worker who does not accept the rules of the
citizenship game is, <u>potentially, a prisoner. Repression, torture, murder
are only applications of democracy</u>.
<p>Moreover, the meaning of an amnesty is that the prisoners are "forgiven"
for what they did. That means of course that they would deny the actions
for which they have been condemned, or at least, that they would express
that the actions that were valid yesterday are no longer valid today. In
this way, the amnesty allows, in the name of "christian forgiveness", the
recuperation of actions that, originally, attacked the bourgeois State,
and became, with the coming of another bourgeois faction to the government,
"actions that are exaggerated but understandable within the struggle against
dictatorship..."
<p>A good example of this is the amnesty conceded by the "Young Spanish
Democracy". It forgave some "antifascist militants" above all in order
to hide the fact that many imprisoned workers were fighting at the same
time against Franco and against his antifascist cousins: in one word, against
the whole bourgeois State. Some of the "anarchists", of the "incontrolados",
are still in the prisons that became "democratic" again.
<p>For us, the liberation of our imprisoned class comrades can only be
made by reclaiming their heroic actions. We do not hope for any grace or
pity from a class that shows us daily that it never hesitates in accumulating
millions of dead bodies to develop its civilization. We know that only
our <u>organized and armed force</u> can pull our comrades out of the <u>fascist
and antifascist prisons.</u> And this is true, precisely because our force
is the continuation of these actions for which our comrades fell. This
is why, not only do we not ask for an amnesty, but to the contrary, we
claim the reasons for which they have been imprisoned. K Marx held this
position when he answered to his judges: "We do not ask for any excuse
nor any pity; do not expect any from us tomorrow."
<p>In front of Capital, all proletarians are subversive. The fact of refusing
to submit to its law means, consciously or unconsciously, fighting for
its destruction. This is why, with all the victims of Capital ("political"
or "of common law"), we say: "We are all subversive. We are all guilty
of wanting to destroy this inhuman world."
<p>For all these reasons, the communist position on press, strikes, association,
amnesty, liberties, about legality, is to assert without doubt that the
organization of the proletariat is based on no right, no law, no liberty
conceded by its enemy but on the contrary, is based on illegal action:
the revolutionary organization for the destruction of wage-slavery. As
Marx said: "We never kept this secret: the field on which we fight is not
the legal one, but the revolutionary one."
<p>That does not mean that we abandon a strike when it becomes legal, or
that we do not publish and distribute revolutionary press when it can circulate
legally or that we refuse to get out of prison when a judge sets us free.
That would simply be reacting antithetically on the same legal field.
<p>One must not identify illegality and clandestinity. Any real strike
is illegal but not clandestine, even if there are secret preparations for
it. The organization of workers in class movements - revolutionary councils,
soviets,...- stands on a completely illegal basis but develops public activities.
The best example of this is the destruction of the bourgeois army by the
proletariat. When the soldiers unify with the rest of the working-class,
after a long work of communist secret propaganda, when they start using
their weapons against the officers and destroy the capitalist army, they
do not do it in a secret way, but openly, though it is the most illegal
action one can imagine. To fight on the illegal field means assuming all
tasks independently of all democratic rights and liberties, which are only
decisions of our enemy and therefore a strategy of the bourgeoisie to fight
us.
<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+2>Correlation of forces between
classes and juridical formalization of an unavoidable situation</font></font></u></h2>
Let us listen once more to the lawyers of Capital: "We are Marxists and
we know very well that all these rights are bourgeois democratic rights,
but the bourgeoisie is incapable of conceding them or maintaining them,
we must impose them and obtain them by force. We must fight today for the
right to strike, for the constituent assembly, for the amnesty of political
prisoners, the liberty of association, of election, of press, etc." Some
others will say that: "One must fight for the autonomy of the working-class
to carry on the permanent revolution"
<br>or that "it is only a step".
<p><u>Have we ever seen a class that could stay autonomous, that could
fight for its own class interests, while fighting at the same time for
the purification of democracy, in other words for the interests of its
class enemies?</u> This question finds no answer from the Trotskyists and
the Stalinists. In their democratic vision of history the proletariat would
not be the first class of history to be at the same time exploited and
revolutionary, but rather the least autonomous and most servile class of
all history. While in their past revolts the slaves used to attack the
slavery system and their masters, the serfs used to attack all medieval
institutions, the church and the lords; these "Marxists" say that the proletariat
should struggle for bourgeois purposes, with bourgeois means to prepare
its own revolution!
<p>But what is the relation between a proletarian advance and the concession
of such or such a right or liberty by the bourgeoisie?
<p>Let us take an example: the situation in Argentina in 1973. For years,
glorious workers' struggles took the prisoners out of their jails. At the
same moment, the "bureaucratic" and "anti-bureaucratic" Peronists, the
Trotsko-Morenists of the PST asked the workers to wait for the amnesty
order, without knowing if it included the grave delinquency (crimes, offenses,...)
cases. The workers' struggle emptied Villa Devoto and permitted many comrades
to re-enter the struggle. How should we interpret these facts? For the
classical bourgeois parties, the coming out of prisoners is always a consequence
of what they legally concede; for those bourgeois parties that call themselves
"workers' parties", it is the opposite: the amnesty orders are the great
workers' victory. Both kind of bourgeois parties agree to characterize
the <u>juridical formalization</u> as fundamental. There is a difference
between these two tendencies, but they are both tendencies of the same
class: <u>the bourgeoisie</u>. They only disagree on the way to kill the
workers' movement, to integrate it democratically and to justify juridically
the situation.
<p>But for all communist revolutionaries, on the contrary, the victory
is not to obtain decrees but expresses itself in the organisative fortification
of our class, in the practical affirmation of its autonomy and in the fact
that the prisoners could join their class brothers in the street. What
about the amnesty? It is only a juridical manoeuvre of the bourgeoisie
to try to integrate in its democratic legality what is happening in the
streets and that it can not avoid any longer. Its aim is obvious: to turn
a situation that is favourable to its historical enemy to its own advantage.
The coming out of prisoners is disguised in amnesty by means of its juridical
formalization.
<p>There is the same opposition between the right of press and the existence
of an autonomous workers' press. In general the liberty of press guarantees
the liberty of undertaking and the financial aspect is predominant. But
in certain circumstances, the liberty of press can be extended to the workers'
press as long as the latter does not have much influence and that, through
its free circulation, it can be controlled by the bourgeoisie. But in a
world where everything is commodity, where everything tends to dissolve
in the world of exchange, of money or consumption, let us not have any
illusion: the workers' press will never develop on that ground.
<p>The same thing happens with the right to strike. Let us leave aside
the well-known case of strikes that do not attack the profit rate of the
bourgeoisie. A strike is only recognized legally when the bourgeoisie is
in a weak position and has no other solution to try to break a strike than
to legalize it. Both cases are bound but any way, legalization never brings
anything new to the proletariat in its struggle. Its force is only its
organized and conscious force, before and after legalization.
<p>Another question for those so-called "Marxists" to think about: for
what other reason would the bourgeoisie give any right to its historical
enemy (the proletariat)?
<p>If it were true that these rights and liberties would help the revolution,
why hasn't there been any revolution in the countries that have a long
democratic tradition, in the U.S.A. for example? Why did it develop in
Russia, which had known centuries of Tsarism and only a few months of "democracy"?
And why did it burst out in the most "democratic" regime of the whole Russian
history, the one of the social-democrat Kerensky? On what rights and liberties
could the workers in Iran rely to defend their strikes and their struggle
of 1978/79? In what way did the acknowledgment of the "Solidarity" union
in Poland help the workers' movement to develop and extend? Didn't it happen
precisely to recuperate the movement by taking it away from its anti-capitalist
and therefore internationalist and autonomous aims to deviate it on the
reform and democratisation of the exploitation system, with the blessing
of both the Pope and Brezhnev?
<p>Why shouldn't we ask the right of insurrection? There is an answer to
all these questions, and it concerns the material class' interests that
are antagonistic to the interests of the proletariat. In fact it is quite
normal that the democratic right or left bourgeoisie would try to impose
its own "human rights" and would make no distinction between amnesty and
liberation of prisoners, the right of strike and the strike, the right
of press and the existence of a workers' press. The heart of all this mystification
is to consider the juridical formalization as a workers' victory while
it is nothing but <u>a weapon of the bourgeoisie.</u>
<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+2>Two ways of interpreting history</font></font></u></h2>
To defend its interests, the bourgeoisie needs to interpret history in
its own way. It always tells us that we do not know history, that the working-class
has always struggled to obtain the right to vote, to strike,... All the
so-called workers' parties reduce the history of proletarian struggles
to a question of conquests of democratic rights in the aim of justifying
their past, present and future actions.
<p>These servants of Capital refuse to see the class antagonisms and the
specific interests of the working-class. They use the slogans of the masses
which are still submitted to the dominant ideology to prove that workers
have always fought for pure democracy and in this way, they kill a second
time the millions of workers "democratically" slaughtered throughout the
history of struggles. In doing so, they try to justify their functions
as deputies in the bourgeois State apparatus. But one must replace the
facts on their real basis (i.e. the immediate and historical interests
of the proletariat which are strictly opposite to the ones of the bourgeoisie),
all these struggles aim at destroying class society, whatever the momentary
consciousness of the workers who live these struggles could be.
<p>"It does not matter much what a worker, or even the whole proletariat,
imagines he is aiming at. What matters is what he is really and historically
obliged to do." (Marx) We do not care about the flags that float over the
struggles, we care only about the enormous efforts of the proletariat to
organize itself and fight the bourgeoisie. Therefore it is very logical
that while so-called "Marxists" consider that universal suffrage is a conquest
of the proletariat, we consider that any reform of the State is a way to
perfect the domination methods of the bourgeoisie. The only true conquests
of the working class are its experience (in struggle) and its growing autonomy
and power of organization. What remains of its struggles is the political
conclusions that worker (proletarian) minorities can draw from their history.
It is only through this "workers' memory" carried by minorities that the
movement can avoid continually making the same mistakes.
<p>On the other hand, the interpretation of history based on the "democratic
conquests" of workers have led the defenders of this vision to parliament
and its ministries. This is not surprising. One must not forget that the
capitalist class is the first dominant class in history for which blood
privileges are not determinant. Any citizen, even a "worker", can reach
the bourgeoisie if he has good capacities to defend the bourgeois point
of view: this is called social climbing. In this way, democracy can choose
the best elements of a worker's origin to control more efficiently the
workers' movement. Let us remember the example of the "worker" Noske, who
became the leader of the Berlin insurrection of 1919, and who killed R.Luxembourg
and K.Liebknecht, Leo Jogiches and thousands of revolutionary workers.
<p>This system not only allows some "workers" to reach a position of oppressors
of their ex-class brothers, but also entire "workers' parties" to be chosen
by Capital to reinforce its domination (for example: the parties of the
2nd International). So it is not surprising that these parties interpret
history as a succession of steps leading to democracy.
<p>As a conclusion, we should say that the two ways of interpreting history
correspond to the interests of the two antagonistic classes of our society:
either the struggle of the proletariat for the communist revolution, or
the bourgeois defence of the democratic dictatorship of Capital.
<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+2>What do the pseudo-marxists
want ?</font></font></u></h2>
Let us now leave the questions of parliaments, ministries, governments,
unions, directors, and let us examine the following question: what "working-class"
does the left wing of Capital wish to see, what would be the result of
its politics, what social situation is it aiming at?
<p>To accept their orders means striking for the defence of rights, associating
in the name of liberty of unions (with them and under their direction),
talking in the name of the right of expression, electing "workers" deputies
in the name of democracy; and why wouldn't we also go to jail in the name
of the right of amnesty and of the right of the prisoners, why wouldn't
we risk our lives in the sacred name of citizenship?
<p>We are not exaggerating: how many workers, who believed them, have ended
up being prisoners or being killed for having written on a wall the order
of their own submission: "Long live democracy, death to dictatorship!"?
<p>If the bourgeoisie reaches this aim, it can control in all respects
its system of domination, and that is what has happened historically. When
a faction of the bourgeoisie is "worn out" by the use of power, it wishes
to take a rest and leaves the "opposite" faction to continue its work.
The right wing would take care of the killing and imprisonment of the proletarians
while the left wing would direct all the workers' claims towards human
rights and democratic liberties. We could even imagine that a time would
come when the workers would not even think of striking for their "shabby
interests", when no "mad" group would have the evil thought of fighting
against democracy or of making a revolution.
<p>The left wing would have then helped in building the earthly paradise
of pure democracy by "convincing" the workers that their aim is to obtain
democratic rights. But, of course, to "convince" proletarians, words are
not enough. So we will see our left humanists assassinate the "provocateurs".
No faction of the bourgeoisie has the privilege of counter-revolutionary
cannibalism.
<p>Nevertheless, the earthly paradise cannot last even with the help of
the bourgeoisie's left wing. Lenin was accused of being a German agent,
Rosa Luxembourg and Karl Liebknecht were killed by the Socialists in the
name of democracy, torture was organized under Allende's regime as much
as under Pinochet's.
<p>But all the capitalists will never be able to stop the struggles, which
come back, always more violently, to destroy all democratic illusions.
And we, proletarians, will not strike for any right, we will strike for
our own material interests, we will fight to take our imprisoned comrades
out of the jails of the capitalist State, without making any concession
to parliamentarism or amnesty campaigns.
<p>The so-called "Marxists", in their fight for the purification of democracy,
only long for the total submission of the working-class, that means, its
disappearance as an autonomous class and its atomization as good citizens.
<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+2>Democratic rights are never
a workers' victory but are always a weapon of the bourgeoisie</font></font></u></h2>
In this text, we have considered separately, for the sake of comprehension,
the different aspects of democratic rights and liberties, which, in fact,
combine:
<p>A/ Pure democracy, a capitalist ideology where there is no class organization
but only citizens.
<p>B/ Practically, the tendency to purify democracy, which leads historically
to the changing of workers into citizens while left and right make them
fight for democratic rights and liberties imposed by democratic State terrorism.
Any class organization is an attack on democracy.
<p>C/ The juridical formalization of unavoidable situations.
<p>D/ The formalization tends to overturn the situation to the advantage
of the bourgeoisie
<p>Of course, none of those points are on the side of the proletariat.
They are all bound: as reference frame (A) can only lead to a situation
of relative democratico-terrorist stability (B) and as the strikes become
too numerous, the pamphlets and subversive papers become uncontrollable,
the bourgeoisie will need to legalize the situation (C). So it authorizes
some publications, it legalizes some strikes... it is evident that it aims
to break (D) the unity of the "agents of anarchy who do not respect democracy"
and that it will find no other solution than to kill them: "now that the
strikes are legal, we must be very strict with those who do not respect
right of work and who do not care for the interests of our country."
<p>And they will try to calm the others with crumbs such as the "right
to strike", "of expression", "of work",... How many times have we seen
that situation?
<p>Each time the bourgeoisie faces a difficult situation, far away from
its democratic paradise (A), it formalizes juridically the situation (C),
which is a decisive weapon (D) to obtain a normalized situation of democracy
(B).
<p>In this remodelled democracy (even if it has been rotten for a long
time) the liberal democrats, the syndicalists, the Stalinists, the Trotskyists,
the Maoists, the socialists will have the opportunity to meet and congratulate
each other on the parliament lobbies: "The rights of citizenship have been
saved... The workers can return to their work and they will soon enjoy
their civil rights."
<p>One need not reach a situation of total political crisis of bourgeois
society to understand all this. Nevertheless, it is in such extreme situation
that the proletariat will dramatically face the alternative: either accept
democracy and counterrevolutionary disaster, or throw away democracy as
it has been done in only one historical but limited example: the insurrection
of October 1917 in Russia.

On the 7th of March 1993, it will be two years since a proletarian insurrection
took place in Iraq.
<p>It was on the 7th of March 1991 when, largely in Iraqi Kurdistan, the
long insurrectionary process that had shaken the whole of Iraq reached
one of it's highest points. During this process, the proletariat had expressed
itself against the war and against all bourgeois forces in the region:
the Ba'ath secret police, Republican Guards, nationalists, local and religious
authorities,... This struggle showed proletarians all over the world the
only path to follow if wars are to be eliminated forever.
<p>Since then, the international bourgeoisie has done all it can to repress
the movement. The nationalists, democrats from all tendencies, humanitarian
organisations, the UN and ba'athists, pacifists, all different kinds of
religious followers,... shared the job of crushing us. By concentrating
on disarming and recruiting proletarians into nationalist militias, they
also sabotaged our internationalism and contributed to the local reorganisation
of the State by arranging elections. Without doubt, another aspect of the
action aiming to crush us was the complete black-out by the worldwide media
as regards the social situation in Iraq.
<p>This insurrectionary process has been recounted at length in various
issues of our central review. A detailed analysis can be found in our French-language
review <i>Communisme</i> (formerly
<i>Le Communiste</i>), issues No. 33
("War or Revolution"), 34 ("Revolutionary defeatism in Iraq") and No. 36
("Proletariat against nationalism") and in our English central review <i>Communism</i>,
issue No. 7 ("War or Revolution" and "A comrades' testimony: a journey
to Iraq"). There is also other information on this question in the framed
texts below.

<blockquote><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=-1>The insurrectionary
process in Iraq started to materialize between the 26th and the 28th of
February 1991, first due to the existence of thousands of armed deserters
wandering around the city of Basra and a number of neighbouring villages
and second, as the central State apparatus started to lose control of the
situation. On the 4th of March, in Basra, this process reached another
qualitative step as columns of tanks, retreating from Kuwait, shot at symbols
of the regime. Clashes took place in different working areas of Baghdad.
It was precisely these areas that were bombed by allied forces at that
time. On the 4th, 5th and 6th of March, the insurrection spread to the
following cities: Nasiryah, Amara, Najaf, Karbala, Hila, Kut,... The insurrection
in Raniyah, on the 5th of March, marked a generalisation of the insurrection
to other regions of Iraq. On the 7th of March, the armed proletariat destroyed
one of the most important strongholds of the regime in Sulaimania. On the
8th of March it was Kalar's turn , on the 9th the insurrection spread to
Koya, on the 10th to Shatlana. On the 11th of March the proletariat rose
up in Arbil and the next day the whole area was in the hands of proletarians.
On the 13th of March the last of the Ba'athist resistance was defeated
in Aqra, on the 14th in Duhok and on the 15th in Zakho. On the 16th and
17th of March, whole columns of insurgents, setting off from all the cities
where they had triumphed, planned to liberate the city of Kirkuk; but the
Ba'athist airforce made this task very difficult and the insurrectionary
movement paid a toll of thousands of deaths. In spite of these massacres,
important battles were still fought and entire barracks were commandeered
by the insurrection, e.g.the command of the military region for the whole
of Kurdistan, near Sulaimania. Finally, between the 19th and the 21st of
March, the insurrection triumphed in Kirkuk, but this city fell back into
Ba'athist hands a few days later.</font></font></blockquote>

In full community with the struggle that our class is waging in this part
of the world, within the framework of an internationalist communist desire
to break with the isolation hindering our struggle in Iraq, we've participated
in the publication and circulation of an <b><u>international poster</u></b>,
on the occasion of the second anniversary of the insurrection.
<p>This poster, signed "<b>Internationalist proletarians</b>", (reproduced
at the end of this text), recalls that nationalism, patriotism, pacifism,
parliamentarism and, even more specifically today, international "humanitarianism",
directed by the UN amongst others, are nothing else but <b>universal weapons
for repression of the proletariat</b>.
<p>This poster was published in several languages (English, Spanish, French,
Kurdish, Arabic, German,...) by comrades of the ICG, other close contacts
and groups from different countries. It was fly-posted, with the help of
different contacts and groups of proletarians, on the walls of cities in
England, France, Germany, Spain, Iraq,... "On the fringe of this initiative",
to use the same terminology as another poster (<i>"This poster has been
produced on the fringe of an international initiative by several groups
gathered under one specific signature: INTERNATIONALIST PROLETARIANS."</i>),
a similar action took place in Quebec. However, comrades over there chose
to put their own signature to the poster and to develop their own slogans,
thus unfortunately expressing their own particularism, rather than affirming
the common contents of internationalist communist action stemming from
our homogeneous class interests. We explain below how vital it is today
to counteract all the particularisms that Capital constantly imposes on
us in order to divide the proletariat, by asserting ourselves as a community
of struggle with identical interests and objectives, rather than as a mere
collection of different groups.
<p>We would like to take this opportunity to stress the profound significance
of the presence and activities of the international bourgeois coalition
today in Iraq: despite differing interests, they are capable of exemplary
unity of action when it comes to defending the heavily shaken bourgeois
order. We also want to stress that in the face of this, in the face of
Capital, <b><u>the assertion of our own terrain of struggle, ie internationalism,</u></b>
is neither a matter of choice for us, nor merely an adjective that we add
to certain local activities, but is <b>a matter of life or death for the
proletariat</b>.
<center>
<h2>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">oOo</font></h2></center>
The capitalist world, its profound social contradiction and the inescapable
character of its destruction can only be understood through the assertion
of proletarian struggle and <b>internationalist action</b>. Outside this
struggle, outside direct international action, <u>talking</u> about internationalism
can only be an illusion; verbal assertion of the international character
of the proletariat is devoid of meaning if it does not consequently materialize
as common internationalist action, aiming to organize ourselves as a single
worldwide force: <b>the worldwide Communist Party</b>.
<p>It is in this framework that we often stress the <b>universal being</b>
that is the proletariat: we are a single international class and the same
enemy faces us everywhere. The whole strength of the bourgeoisie consists
precisely of <b>denying</b> (through the combined action of the world media)
<b>the
universal character of the conditions of struggle of the proletariat</b>,
so as to confine each revolt within its specific characteristics.
<p>Denial of the worldwide character of the proletariat is not just "theoretical",
but materialises and is structured forcefully by <b>permitting the bourgeoisie
to impose the terrain which suits it best in order to defeat the proletariat.</b>
In other words, by making the proletariat "forget" that it constitutes
a single universal class and imposing the terrain of confrontation that
suits it best, the bourgeoisie manages to dictate the framework of war
it sends us to : <b>the international unified force of the bourgeoisie</b>
against <b>the isolated activity of our class</b>, confined to such or
such an area.
<p>The bourgeoisie uses different methods in order to impose this terrain,
<b>its
own</b> terrain, and to succeed in isolating proletarians country by country:
the repression of all direct links between proletarians of different countries,
campaigns to falsify, minimise and rubbish the struggles so as to cut them
off from their fellow proletarians more easily, blockades, white terror,...
Bourgeois politics for the proletariat, typical social-democratic politics,
materialise more particularly by keeping the proletariat of each country
within its confines, transforming its "international" activity into activities
by proxy, mediation, petitions, of "solidarity" by way of cheques and telegrams.
Social-democracy always has its proposals for "internationalism" at the
ready, as a means of preventing the struggle of the proletariat in that
area against its "own" State.
<p>Let us explain ourselves in the light of history.
<p>The wave of struggle between 1917 and 1923 was characterised by an unrivalled
generalisation of revolutionary development: from Europe to the Middle
East, Latin America to India, the revolutionary movement overrode national
borders, allowing the call for international organisation of the proletariat
to reverberate throughout the world. The Communist International was, without
doubt, an attempt to respond to the bourgeois desire to isolate the proletariat
in Russia. This partial response took the form of, amongst other things,
various sorts of sabotage and internationalist action against the armies
sent to wage war on insurgent proletarians in Russia. Setting up the Communist
International and its Manifesto in 1919 contributed to an intensification
of the international insurrectional movement (Germany, Hungary, Bavaria,
Austria, Portugal, Brazil) in which the proletariat waged a revolutionary
war against its "own State", its "own bourgeoisie". In spite of this, the
Communist International (leaving aside the historical responsibility of
the Bosheviks) was not, unfortunately, a true break from the social-democratic
conception of a federation of national parties. Each national communist
party (with a few exceptions, such as some practical splits made by the
K.A.P.D.) continued to be determined by contingencies of opinion based
on struggles that were occurring "nationally", a weakness that opened the
door for the bourgeoisie to first slow down, then destroy the revolution.
Struggle by struggle, nation by nation, international bourgeois forces
were able to impose war with their allies. The strength of the bourgeoisie
thus resided in its capacity to impose the terrain upon which it is historically
strongest: that of struggle launched within the framework of a nation,
in which <b>the balance of forces develops between local proletarians</b>
on one hand,
<b>and international bourgeois forces</b> on the other. It
is precisely when the proletariat showed its internationalism, when our
class could structure a common and international response to social war,
that the bourgeoisie felt at its weakest. Thus the international proletariat
acted to support the insurrection of October 1917 in Russia, breaking the
bourgeois information blockade, prolonging revolutionary defeatism in all
camps and stopping the war, subsequently taking on different levels of
action.
<p>However, in this context one must take into account the immense difficulties
that confronted the insurgent proletariat in Mexico or Russia, for example,
in trying to communicate news across borders about what was going on. Throughout
the rest of the world, the proletarian insurrections in Mexico (1910-1914)
and Russia (1917-1919) were portrayed as simple anti-dictatorial popular
uprisings. With this aim, Social Democracy had a ready-made theory - that
of backward countries, their need for bourgeois revolution and/or "proletarian"
revolution to develop bourgeois democratic tasks. This ideology not only
led pseudo-anarchists and other social democrats to deny the proletarian
character of the Mexican and Russian insurrections, but also led organisations
such as the KAI, who had broken away from the 2nd and 3rd Internationals,
to sink into the deepest confusion on the issue.
<p>If we apply what we have just described to what is at stake today in
Iraq, we can see that it is in the bourgeoisie's interest to confront each
one of our class's actions by limiting it to a single region and opposing
it with an amalgamation of international forces (Kurdish nationalists,
allied forces, UN, humanitarian and religious organisations...) This is
rudimentary for the politico-military force reproducing Capital, which
aims to destructurise every assertion of our class homogeneity, by attacking
all forms of our expression. On our side, we find it very difficult to
act as a single unified force, but our enemies are capable of uniting all
their forces, in an instant, to crush us whenever it proves necessary.
<p>All our activity -<b>asserting ourselves as the worldwide proletariat-</b>
must aim to break with the isolation with which the bourgeoisie tries to
confine our struggle in Iraq. All of our energy must be directed at extending
the direct action we are carrying out in this region by direct action in
the rest of the world. We must shatter the isolation, smash the bourgeois
ability to isolate some of us and repress us, whilst our class brothers
remain indifferent elsewhere.
<p>To this end we must, more than ever, <b>assert our struggle in Iraq
as a moment of the worldwide proletariat's struggle</b>. We must declare
ourselves to be a <b>single body</b>, a single class, <b>united </b>in
the living conditions imposed on us internationally and, moreover, in the
worldwide struggle we are waging to abolish our condition as wage-labourers.
<p>Unfortunately, we have come across huge misunderstandings on this issue,
even with comrades who are close to us and who <u>claim to agree</u> with
our positions.
<p>We have been confronted with a lot of difficulties around the issue
of producing a common poster. There was organisational resistance, in keeping
with the present sectarian period, which manifested itself in a reluctance
to take part in the production and flyposting of the poster or in considering
us to be wrong in taking on our own responsibility as a group in signing
the poster.
<p>There was also some doubt concerning the information given by our comrades.
Some contacts demanded proof (!?) of our assertions, others purely and
simply denied the insurrectional character of the proletarian explosions
which took place in Iraq and only accepted the information... when the
bourgeois press published it in part. Over and above great declarations
of principle, we see an expression of submission to the State in all of
this: information broadcast by the bourgeois media are more readily accepted
than those transmitted, with all the imaginable attendant difficulties,
via our militant network.
<p>There were also misunderstandings about the task itself which was considered
to be an isolated activity. However, it is impossible to grasp the significance
of this international initiative without placing it in the context of its
being a further action in our assertion of internationalist activity, community
of struggle and<b> organisation of international communist action.</b>
<p>There were other misunderstandings about the task itself, too often
brought down to the level of "solidarity from us here to them over there"
(according to the point of view of those in regions other than the Middle
East); conversely, it was seen as a call from "here- Iraq- for those elsewhere
to have solidarity with us". In reality it was an activity by the international
proletariat "here" and "there" against our enemies "here" and "there".
<p>Finally, stemming from the previous misunderstandings, this activity
was considered to be a mediation, a simple advertising campaign for such
and such a group of proletarians, rather than a counter-attack on the concerted
activity of the worldwide bourgeoisie to isolate a regional faction of
our class in order to be better able to crush it.
<p>In general, we are faced with a parliamentary and federalist conception
of proletarian unity, in which contacts, instead of pushing for united
international action, keep stressing their own particular characteristics,
stating that each individual group should be consulted on each of the various
slogans or signatures..., without realising that this is a congressional
and confederational conception belonging to Social Democracy, practically
opposed to the community of struggle and that to accept such criteria by
way of thousands of paralysing communications, would transform our community
of struggle into a parliament (1).

<blockquote><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=-1>The elections for
a national Kurdish parliament were a decisive moment for the action of
the worldwide bourgeoisie against our class. At the time, our enemies did
not let an opportunity for provocation and falsification slip them by.
The media in Kurdistan and the rest of Iraq did all it could to develop
the confusion between the positions of internationalist communists and
the nationalists. The climax of these campaigns was, without doubt, the
announcement by various nationalist radio stations- up to several times
a day- that our organisation, the ICG, had called for participation in
the Kurdish elections. This was despite the fact that, right from the beginning,
our activities in the region had been against all nationalists and all
parliaments. Once again, we stress that the very basis upon which our group
arose is <u>invariably against democracy and the nation</u> and that any
person or group placing our group in the framework of any sort of process
of electoral and/or national reform, is acting directly against our programmatical
basis. At best, it could be a mistake or falsification of our positions;
but in most cases it must be the result of provocation incited by the Home
Office or National Defence Ministry.</font></font></blockquote>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">---------------------------------</font></h1></center>
As the Internationalist Communist Group we have been (and still are) faced
with the following situation:
<p>On the one hand, our comrades in Iraq claim that their strength is our
strength and that it is precisely our international force that is preventing
the allied counter-revolutionary forces from transforming the local reorganisation
of the State into an open offensive. They have told us that the action
taken by ICG and other internationalist groups in Europe and elsewhere
is preventing our direct enemies (nationalists of all tendencies in Kurdistan)
from carrying out systematic attacks on our comrades, because it makes
the nationalists more vulnerable.
<p>On the other hand and simultaneously, we try to lead this type of direct
action in Europe and in America, yet some close comrades tell us that they
don't see the point in such activities; they distrust the information we
give them; they say that they would agree if they could add a different
signature; they agree with one slogan but not with the other; they state
that this kind of activity is pure propaganda, useless in the present situation
because nowadays the proletariat "here" is not interested in what's going
on "over there", etc...
<p>In short, just at the time when our comrades insist that we maintain
the pressure against nationalists, we are faced with thousands of sectarian,
anti-organisative and individualistic pretexts that, in spite of their
intentions, contribute to the isolation of vanguard sectors of the worldwide
proletariat and to the repression of our comrades.
<center>
<h2>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">oOo</font></h2></center>
In line with the different calls we have made to proletarian internationalist
groups, the Internationalist Communist Group has made a lot of effort to
structure and centralise our activity in the region of Iraq in connection
with activities we are developing elsewhere.
<p>With our very meagre resources we have struggled to ensure an improved
centralisation of various structures in the region. In the face of a total
lack of means of communication with Iraq (no international post or telephone)
we have undertaken serious efforts to find other ways of international
internal contact.
<p>Taking the enormous international importance of the events experienced
in the region into account, as well as the exceptional interest that the
proletariat there brings to our positions, <b>we have decided to publish
a new central review in Kurdish</b>, in addition to the development of
the Arabic central review and publishing the Theses of our programmatical
direction in Arabic. If possible, we intend to publish, along with other
groups of proletarians, a local review with the title "The Internationalist
Proletarian" , with the aim of providing a wider framework for direct action
and propaganda in the region of Iraq.
<p>The flyposting and production of the poster undertaken by militants
in various countries should be understood along the same lines. It was
not a question of having "<b>solidarity with</b>" proletarians in Iraq,
but rather one of <b>acting together</b> to assert the same struggle, interests,
community, force, in a way that the bourgeoisie would find it impossible
to wipe us out "bit by bit".
<p>It is important to us that the distinction is made between <b>false
solidarity</b>, which is seen to be a spectacular communication fictitiously
linking workers of different countries and <b>effective solidarity</b>,
resulting from common struggle.
<p>Posters or leaflets calling for solidarity "here" with those "over there",
appealing for compassion, for petitions, fundraising, for letter-writing
to our torturers or asking for the help of parliamentarians...are not only
harmless for the bourgeoisie, but also constitute Social Democratic politics
par excellence, aiming to compartmentalise proletarian needs, such as the
liberation of imprisoned comrades, the denunciation of repression in one
area and the need to spread information about our comrades' struggles.
They constitute bourgeois politique for the proletariat par excellence,
because they transform the need for direct action against Capital into
collaboration with the bourgeoisie. The extreme opposite of this is proletarian
direct action, communism against Capital. Distributing leaflets or posters,
depending on their form and content, is part of this activity if it takes
place in a worldwide perspective, in line with the fact that the proletariat
has only one kind of solidarity with its class brothers: direct action
against its own bourgeoisie. Instead of calling for compassion or admiration
for activity elsewhere, communist propaganda and agitation aims to facilitate
generalisation of the struggle, aims to show that, here and now, the contradictions
are fundamentally the same. If proletarians are active elsewhere, it is
not a result of specific local characteristics, but is because of general
reasons which concern "us" directly... which imply that "we" can and must
act as well. Our poster is evidence that the activities of the Iraqi proletariat
has illustrated the only possible way to eliminate wars for ever.
<p>The flyposting that was carried out is much more than just flyposting
to us, communists in Iraq, Iran, England, Spain, Germany, France, North
and South America and elsewhere. It was a specific and modest manifestation
of the worldwide force that the proletariat aims to structure. In its attempt-
albeit very weak- to put the poster up at the same time in different parts
of the globe, the proletariat <b>forced its social enemy to fight on less
secure grounds than it is used to</b>. There is nothing better for nationalist,
humanitarian and religious organisations than to concern themselves with
"each proletariat" according to "its" national flag (this is how the bourgeoisie
sees it!).
<p>By forcing the bourgeoisie to fight on its sinking sand of directly
international proletarian activity, we will prevent the crushing of our
struggle in Iraq and can prepare tomorrow's struggles.
<p>It is not a question of making platonic appeals for international support,
but, with the help of all sections of the proletarian vanguard and militants
from the world over, of <b>counter-attacking politically</b> the international
bourgeoisie and its attempts to liquidate, by way of humanism and nationalism,
some of our best comrades.
<p>Let us repeat once again, today dominant defeatism combines with Social-Democracy's
historical programme to deny the importance of such an initiative. The
key to social-democratic policy on this precise issue is the reality of
a weak level of consciousness regarding the existence of our class as a
worldwide class, which it uses to wipe out any possibilities of direct
action and to divide the proletariat by arguing that there are "objectively
different situations in each country" as a way of justifying the impossibility
of carrying out action "here and now". The bourgeoisie intervenes to impose
silence on the proletariat, forcing it to resort to bourgeois intermediaries
(inactivity, in reality), explaining that what goes on "here" has nothing
in common with what happens "there" and that the only thing to do is to
go via the common channels offered by society to show "solidarity": "make
a poster here about the situation over-there", "make a poster here for
the people here", send a protest letter, a delegation, or some money...
<p>The historical opposition between parliamentarism and direct action
is at play at this level.
<p>Parliamentarism and democracy aim to broadcast their activity to the
hilt, to separate decisions from action and theory from practice, advising
proletarians of all countries to organise activities of "solidarity" by
proxy...
<p>The direct action and communist camp aims to carry out violent direct
action against its enemy, not in this sense of immediate violence (as far
as the international poster we are discussing is concerned), but in the
sense of asserting our struggle on our own terrain: that of <b>directly
international confrontation</b>, that of the <b>assertion</b>- unbearable
for the bourgeoisie- of our community of struggle, <b>of our common being</b>.
<p>When proletarians from a dozen countries act together (despite all the
present constraints) and plan an activity to carry out together (if possible,
simultaneously) against the same enemy, in the face of the same indifference,
fighting for the same interests and objectives... they are carrying out
a violent counter-attack on the bourgeoisie.
<p>We are aware of the tragic discrepancy that exists today between the
aggression that our class undergoes more or less throughout the world and
the difficulties we have in reacting to these attacks. In this sense, we
know that this common activity, like all the other activities that have
been taken to centralise our struggle in Iraq, is really only a drop in
the ocean compared to the enormity of the tasks we need to accomplish.
It is obvious that we will need to undertake, against the tide, far more
than these initiatives to undo this system of death that suffocates us.
<p>In spite of this and in the context of a tragic absence of structures
for international proletarian centralisation, it is important to us to
stress the fact that several comrades from different backgrounds, living
in different parts of the world have taken the initiative to centralise
themselves against the tide of anti-organisationalism and dominant sectarianism
and have thus been able to experience, by acting as one, a necessary moment
of the "Growing Union" of the proletariat with a view to the definitive
abolition of this world of death.
<p>Today, we need this community of practical direct action more than ever.
Its links are forged in common activity and it is from these links, against
current sectarianism and individualism, that the seeds of an internationalist
communist organisation of the proletariat will grow and will destroy the
inhuman barbarity to which we are subjected.

1. Here we must respond to the old accusation made against communists taking
initiatives. We are not denying the need for discussion within the proletarian
community of struggle, by the comments we have made above. Of course we
have to develop and centralise thousands of international discussions.
But paralysing internationalist action, under the pretext that each participant
must agree with each expression or be consulted about every step of the
movement, actually renders any sort of action impossible, particulary in
a period when there is no permanent centralising structure for action and
discussion. As a very old comrade once said, a step forward in our movement
is more important than a dozen programmes. Marx and Engels did not wait
to consult all their contacts and comrades before taking direct action,
before motivating the international movement by writing and publishing
the "Communist Party Manifesto" in 1847.

<font face="Comic Sans MS">* <font size=+4>*</font> *</font></h1></center>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The following text is not merely the result
of a theoretical attempt to place the origin of AIDS back within the mode
of production in which it materialised. The text is, above all, the product
of a practical struggle led side by side with a militant from our group,
who came from North America and who was struck down by AIDS. (Militarists
say "hit by", scientists preferring to use the term "struck down by", in
order to deny their own responsibility).</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Our comrade started to share militant activity
with us, on the basis of a radical break from drug addiction. His integration
into the group coincided with total abstention from drugs. This is what
he said:</font>
<blockquote><i><font face="Comic Sans MS">"(...) Drug addiction is one
of many possible expressions of a social response and position in the face
of the frustrations of Capital, along with madness, delinquency and TV
addiction. It is an unconscious revolt which stigmatises the refusal of
the system in the flesh of its victims. Above all, it is the triumph of
Capital's harnessing power: the society of drug addicts is practically
the epitome of the capitalist model. Drug addiction is the triumph of individualism
and anti-solidarity (each man for himself, dope for himself), the triumph
of alienation (the concrete alienation of dependence on a product), the
triumph of reification (suicide of a body/object, sold for drugs), the
triumph of a palliative (choice between drugs or suffering), the triumph
of the commodity (exchange value and use value, having the same denominator:
drugs for survival), the triumph of value (a few banknotes for a few milligrams
of powder and pleasure), etc... Drug addiction is a system of immediate
institutionalised survival, otherwise known as the capitalist system..."</font></i></blockquote>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shortly before writing this, he had learnt that
he had AIDS.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">It is impossible to describe the struggles
of everyday life that this news gave rise to: permanent confrontation with
the doctors, violent take over of the medical file compiled on him, radical
critique of food (our comrade defined capitalist food as an attempt at
generalised poisoning), vicious attempts, in vain, to obtain information
on the possibilities publicised by the "alternative" medical vultures,
as corrupted by financial interests as their "official" colleagues, struggle
against the ideology of anti-pleasure, refusal to die in hospital, permanent
battle not to accept -despite every conceivable pressure to do so (1) -
the poison AZT, conceived by medical commerce, refusal to take part in
experiments aiming to turn him into a guinea-pig,...</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">We lived every one of these moments together,
like brothers in arms, with all the determination and passion for this
one "true life" that the militant critique of the State constitutes for
us. We discussed and chose, fully aware, the orientation and direction
to give each of these moments of permanent struggle, with the result that
our comrade did not die ill. He died fighting. He died living, as opposed
to the majority of half dead-half living "beings" who populate the realm
of capitalist social peace today and whose only reality is dictated by
the monster Money, which dominates them.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">The text we are publishing here follows the
rhythm of all these moments. Most of the thoughts within it, as well as
the communist point of view which animates it, are inextricably linked
with the innumerable activities and discussions that we had together.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">This is why this text is not dedicated to
our comrade. This text IS our comrade. Our common break from the present
world of death makes perfect sense. Here is how he formulated it:</font>
<blockquote><i><font face="Comic Sans MS">"(...) The context of our struggle
is paradox, is contradiction. 'We take up arms to abolish arms. We survive
to abolish survival,... and at last to live. We must assume this contradiction,
cross it, if we want, one day in the distant future, to live...In order
to escape my 'madness' I arrived at an impasse, with two solutions: to
chose to fight or to chose not to fight. I chose."</font></i></blockquote>

To make it quite clear for those who do not want to be hood-winked, nor
to sing along with the State, the lyrics lies spewed out daily by the press,
we want to state unequivocally that <b>the AIDS retrovirus is a direct
product of the new commercial possibilities opened up by molecular biology!</b>
Science, financed and equipped by Research and Progress in the military
sector, has produced another 'cock-up' which it is attempting to conceal
by reassuring reports fed to public opinion!
<p>AIDS made its brilliant debut amongst the products of Science and the
brainchildren of Progress - nuclear and chemical weapons, high security
prisons, steroids, adulterated oil, bank safes, bloodletting, antibiotics,the
electric chair, plastic surgery, television, parking metres, ECT, A-10
aeroplanes and Apache helicopters...
<p>As materialists, we are going to expose some elements of the social
and economic context in which Science and Medicine were struggling, in
order to understand that the HIV retrovirus had every "reason" (commercial
and/or "accidental") to appear... at a time when conditions were ripe to
create it. This is not a question of sensationalism, but of breaking away
from the predominating scientific and democratic folklore.
<p>It is no more possible to envisage the mysterious apparition of AIDS,
than it is to appreciate the reasons for the scientists' desperate efforts
to obscure its origin, without a grasp of the way in which value intimately
determines knowledge, the strict dictatorship of Money over Science, the
total collusion between Science and Money (2), the profound unity between
pharmaceutical research and commercial need, the inextricable link uniting
the military domain, the politicians and the economic world.
<p>We have set out to clarify our fundamental starting points for this
text by way of the following comments:
<p>We do not intend to contrast "good" science with "decadent, bad or corrupt"
science. Science, as knowledge subsumed by capitalist valorisation, is
rotten to the core. Like all of Capital's productive forces, Science is
fundamentally inhuman: <b>not only in its applications, but in its foundations.</b>
<p>It is impossible to put Science to good use, just as it is impossible
to do so with the Police, for example. We have no more to reproach the
Police than we do Science. Our critique is neither a response to "cock-ups"
(be they scientific or police) nor a criticism of, for example, the scientific
development and police usage of truncheons capable of firing electric shocks.
Our practical and theoretical critique relates to the very existence of
a force organized and armed in the defence of bourgeois Property. It relates
to the essence of a consciousness whose narrow horizons consist of the
need to accumulate capital. Science, like the Police, must not be reformed,
but destroyed (3).
<p>We apologize for repeating ourselves in this introduction on the subject
of how, from a communist point of view, from the point of view of truly
human needs, Science is beyond rehabilitation. We reiterate - to ensure
that we are really well understood - that in handling this critique of
the crap put forward concerning the origin of AIDS, we wish to dissociate
ourselves completely from a critique limiting itself to a denunciation
of the "excesses" of Science (like the bourgeois left denounce the "excesses"
of the Police). The historical dictatorship of Value over Humanity has
been enforced on human beings as they strive to develop knowledge, <b>so
that even Science's paradigms are rotten to the core.</b> Such fundamental
and sacred (so called neutral) concepts such as "matter", "atom"... are
strictly determined by money, the narrow minded horizons of the Scientist,
that slave to research (money!) and development (capitalist!), who is himself
affected in every way by the dictatorship of the <u>rate of profit</u>.
<p>We are not intending to write a scientific anti-thesis. We have taken
up specific scientific arguments from time to time, because from our point
of view - intent on the destruction of the science of capitalist death
- they can sometimes reveal the reality off the commercial and warmongering
iceberg hidden beneath the "tip", made up of tons of papers justifying
scientific activity (4). Our analysis is therefore neither "scientific"
nor "objective" in the bourgeois sense, stemming rather from the reality
of existing social relationships. It is on this basis that we state that
AIDS is objectively an <b>invaluable commodity for Capital.</b> We want
to fight against being used as "medicine fodder", as salaried guinea-pigs.
<p>Let's dive into scientific hell! The old mole is digging underground...
let's follow!
<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">Science, Capital's barbarism!</font></u></h2>
The priests of Science have got several methods of avoiding ridicule and
hiding their delirium. One of these is the artificial barrier of abstruse
terminology which they call "specialist" and surround themselves with when
it comes to their diagnoses, "discoveries", medicines and other witchcraft.
<p>By using another language they are aiming to discourage any attempts
to question their power. They wear long white coats (5) for the same reasons.
Armed with their jargon and impressive accessories the Scientist is above
all a witch, a master!
<p>Medical stupidity is still incapable of pointing out the true <b>origins</b>
of the illnesses we suffer (for example, the junk food our wages permit
us, the torture known as Work!) and these learned assassins continue to
surround themselves with prestigious diplomas and other props, to convince
the idiot citizens to let themselves be prodded by them.
<p>But along with the "passive" lies of their vocabulary and ceremonies
go the active lies - to protect Science you <b>have to lie, to impose the
lie as a truth, dogma and repress those who will not accept it.</b>
<p>Science is a power: that of the State! It is knowledge put to the service
of Value. Science is under the orders of the bourgeoisie, serving its Knowledge
helping the dominant class in its attempts to impose trade order. The applications
of Science are above all commercial and military. Science is a monstrous
trade and to impose it, one has to lie!
<p>Galileo was considered to be an heretic by the majority of his colleagues
because, by making a mockery of Copernicus's explanation that the earth
revolves around the sun, he was exposing, even at that time, the institutionalized
ignorance and stupidity that Science represents, thus invalidating years
of University and Academic research (6). The lie was imposed on him by
making him recant in front of the Inquisition in 1633. But he suffered
less than millions of proletarian heretics, who for centuries have tried
to flee work, denouncing it as torture but being forced to sing "Work is
health", "Hey ho, hey ho! It's off to work we go!" by idiotic popular tradition
and Science... or even "Arbeit macht frei".
<p>Nothing has change since the time when those charlatans imposed their
lies. Nothing has changed since official medicine advocated blood letting
to cure fevers (7).
<p>Today the picture is no brighter.
<p>We are offered "anti-life" atomic bombs (antibiotics) in order to enable
us to return to work quickly.
<p>The author of this article, too naive at the time, suffered daily injections
of the horrendous poison steroid... to treat a minor depression. To "cure"
children's coughs they advocate tranquillizers in the form of syrup (good
night and have a good day at work tomorrow, parents!)
<p>The contraceptive pill, that booming commercial enterprise, is a real
concentration of poisons leading to a risk of not only breast and uterine
cancers, but also malformations of the genital tract in their female descendants...
etc... etc.
<p>Here we are not talking about medical "mistakes", such as surgical instruments
left inside a stomach, confusion over the amputation of a limb or a mix-up
of case-notes, but rather the official version of medicine, what every
apprentice-torturer receives as orders by his superiors to calm down -
sorry, treat- his patients (8) (they hypocritically call their victims
"patients").
<p>No, nothing has changed in the world of lies and Science. The most famous
doctors who bled their patients to treat them, were protected and paid
by the highest State institutions. No one was allowed to question their
knowledge and power. Today, the democratic State finances the ideologies
and lies of these thousands of scientific assassins in their redeeming
white plumage, who bombard us, year after year, with <b>hypnotics</b> to
numb the time we spend recuperating for work, <b>stimulants</b> to keep
us awake at work, <b>hormones</b> to fatten up the low cost junk which
sustains us and <b>anabolic steroids</b> to beat our "competitors",...
Science is the Barbarism of Capital... in all its splendour!
<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">Did HIV come from monkeys ?</font></u></h2>
It is hardly surprising that, in common with their ancestors, today's representatives
of Science attempt to impose their dogmas and lies upon us. Anything goes
when protecting commerce and the State. Hence AIDS! To hide the fact that
it is yet another monstrosity directly emanating from their laboratories,
the State has not skimped on theories to cloud the issue of the laboratory
origin of the virus.
<p><b>A few examples.</b>
<p>In 1981, when a strange and hitherto unknown epidemic came to light,
it was attributed to those who appeared to be particularly vulnerable to
it: homosexuals. From this stemmed a surge of delirium masked by new diagnoses,
emanating from the same idiots who are "reassuring" us today. One of the
hypotheses argued that "sperm administered rectally had an immunosuppressant
effect". More clearly put, these scientists attributed the loss of man's
natural defence to the sweet pleasure of buggery! Thanks, Morality!
<p>In 1985, scientocops fabricated an impressive web of events, beginning
with a virus attributed to the African Green monkey. This was supposed
to have mysteriously (?!) contaminated West Africans, thus causing a slight
mutation of the virus which, after two further steps, brought about the
HIV virus, responsible for the epidemic. We are not going to recount the
idiotic logic of the laboratory experiments leading them to this conclusion,
because in 1988, exposed, they were forced to admit that there had been
some contamination in the lab and that the initial virus that they had
taken as their starting point... was in fact a product of their own criminal
manipulations. Hooray for biology (9)!
<p>Again in 1985, in an attempt to distance the birth date of HIV from
the years when material conditions made laboratory fabrication of the virus
possible (since 1971!), American scientists "proved" that there were HIV
antibodies in more than 50% of blood samples taken and deep frozen in Kenya
and Uganda between 1959 and 1970. Loudly proclaimed in all world newspapers,
these advances in research were refuted without publicity a few months
later: the tests were found to be unreliable and new tests had proved the
total absence of HIV antibodies in the same samples! Long live Science!
<p>To distance still further the spectre of the <b>scientific origin</b>
of AIDS, it was necessary not only to disconnect the <b><u>dates</u></b>
at which the illness appeared from the time at which it became possible
to engineer the virus, but also to conceal its <b><u>geographical</u></b>
origin (10).
<p>It is reasonable to think that such a scientific monstrosity originated
from the historical world centres of accumulation of scientific knowledge
(USA, Europe, Latin America...) and that therefore these same centres are
attempting (as if by chance!) to distance the origin from themselves :
"the sin must have stemmed from Africa or Haiti!"
<p>Thus, in 1982, the Atlanta Centre for Disease control, an organization
collecting medical epidemiological information for the US and influencing
doctors throughout the world with its reports and recommendations, defined
Haitians as a high risk group. In order to strengthen their case, the CDC
argued that Haitians with AIDS do not present any of the "classical" identifying
risk factors (IV drug abuse, homosexuality, haemophilia). How did they
come to such a conclusion? Simply because the Haitian patients questioned
in the US <b>"declared"</b> to the doctors that they were neither homosexuals
nor IV drug abusers. One only has to appreciate the taboo of homosexual
prostitution in the US as well as in Haiti, the severity of repression
by the US Immigration Office, what it is actually like to reply to medical
questionnaires (real state interrogation), the widespread condemnation
of those admitting to drug addiction... in short, if one can grasp the
precariousness of a life clinging to a string pulled by Medicine, Justice
and the Immigration Office, one can understand why, out of 34 proletarian
immigrants from Haiti who were HIV positive, only 4 would admit the origin
of their "crime"!
<p>On this basis, the CDC denounced Haitians and left them to the malice
of public opinion. It then took 3 years for the CDC to retract and remove
Haitians from the category of a high risk population, although to this
day they are banned from giving blood!
<p>This last example is interesting as it illustrates how the cover-ups
that the bourgeoisie resort to are never the simple and machiavellian result
of a few evil manipulators. All these lies start from a network of half-truths,
which meet the needs of the dominant class and obscure the full story (the
tree that hides the wood!), distortions of the truth, imposing themselves
as ideology.
<p>In defining the Haitians as a high risk group, the scientists started
from a material basis (the fear of these immigrant proletarians, a fear
consolidated by their refusal to admit to their homosexuality or drug addiction)
and conclude statistically ("it's Scientific," they shout as soon as they
have collected some numbers) that there are proportionally more Haitians
than Americans with HIV!
<p>The condemnation of Haitians has a function - exorcising the fear of
millions of Americans - and responds to a need: allowing the continuity
of the development of Science (and hence value!) without hindrance. Thus,
to protect Medicine and Progress (indispensable to the disorganized movement
of Capital), the State has to impose "truths" (ideologies), screening human
worries from the horrors of reality.
<p>But these "screens", ideologies, constitute a material force permitting
Capital to prolong its inevitable agony: this crap is put forward in scientific
terms, littered with absolute declarations, slowly uttered by those responsible
for the medical "world", which imposes itself in the face of profanity
and makes the idiot people hold Science in awe, in the same way that they
kneel in front of the Pope or Yeltsin!
<p>Paradise - be it Christian or "socialist"- uses the Pope's holy water
or Castro's cigars as its props and as soon as it is faced with millions
of homeless, unemployed, the 40,000 children dying of hunger daily, in
short, when its absurd logic is opposed by prosaic reality, there is nothing
left!
<p>Nevertheless, it is all these lies that cement public opinion and turns
every human being into a schizophrenic, someone separate from himself,
sublimating his suffering to the point of defending it as his own happiness
(11).
<p>To return to the subject, when one sees the weakness of arguments concerning
the origin of AIDS, one would think that this time there is little chance
that anyone would fall for them! Wrong! The stupidity of these explanations
does not prevent the media from expounding them!
<p>Thus, to distance the date of the appearance of HIV from the period
in which material conditions meant that it could be produced in laboratories,
the researchers (of lies!) simply "discovered" a few cases of AIDS plump
in the middle of the 50's and 60's in Africa. Rapidly it became apparent
that tests supposedly demonstrating antibodies to the deadly virus in those
old test tubes were invalid (see above). In the end it was decided to diagnose
it retrospectively on the basis of vague resemblance to symptoms described
in the files of the patients whose blood had been taken!!! To prove the
truth of a premise, what better way than to invent it?
<p>In the same way, in the mid 80's, justifications made to lead research
of cases of AIDS dating back to the early 70's towards Africa rather than
the U.S. (12) were based purely on the fact that it was unthinkable that
such a disease could have passed unnoticed in that centre of Progress and
Science that is the USA!
<p>Whatever part stupidity, ignorance, lies, machiavellism, defense of
interest, competition.... have to play, what drives doctors and other scientists
to prolong their monstrous laboratory creation by equally monstrous lies
regarding the origin of the virus, what they have in common is the twisted
class point of view that makes them submit to the laws of the State, to
the dictatorship of commercial expansion and capitalist progress!
<p>The racism underlying ideologies which place the original appearance
of AIDS in Africa or Haiti is merely an extension of the dominant power
of this giant of Economy (and thus Science and Progress) that is the US.
<p>But racism is not the prerogative of bourgeois Americans: all nations
are racist and participate in one way or another in campaigns which denounce
a "neighbour" by using AIDS to reinforce National Union. This is not a
new concept: throughout history the bourgeoisie has used illness to feed
the racist character of the state.
<p>Around 1550, as an epidemic of syphilis spread throughout Europe, every
nation tried to pass the buck to "foreigners". The Russians accused the
Poles, the English and the Turks called it "the French disease", the French
knew it as the Italian illness and the Italians blamed the Spanish...

<font face="Comic Sans MS">oOo</font></h2></center>
Amongst the confusion of these demented "truths", counter-truths imposed
upon us, a dominant idea aims to place the origin of the HIV virus well
away from scientific labs, far away from the most well-known centres. In
fact, everything points to the fact that AIDS appeared at a time when it
had become technically possible to create such a virus, but public opinion,
vessel for dominant ideology, vulgarizes the scientists' stories and turns
itself into a shield against dissenters, making them look like paranoid
enemies of Science. It all works out well for them! The world keeps on
turning and goods keep on circulating! "The origin of AIDS ", the village
gossip explains to me, "can be traced to a mysterious virus found in Green
monkeys in Africa and which, because a negro doubtless buggered a monkey,
has been transformed into a deadly epidemic. Debauchery (prostitution,
homosexuality and drug addiction) then completed the work of these savages
by spreading the virus throughout the planet"!
<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">Science's horrific stroll in the garden of
retroviruses</font></u></h2>
We are not going to take our turn at throwing our own pebble in the garden
of scientific, journalistic or political hypotheses regarding the precise
origin of the AIDS virus. As materialists, we have started by explaining
the function of the crap spouted on the subject: to protect Science, defend
Medicine, justify the astronomical sums spent in laboratories from which
this genetic monster doubtless originates. We now want to give certain
examples which show that <b>since the early seventies, it has been technically,
scientifically, biologically and materially possible to produce laboratory
hybrids</b> (13), clones, of which HIV is only a variant. There is no sensationalism
in these proposals: it is a recognised fact, practised and commercially
developed by an important section of medical research.
<blockquote><i>"The technology required to make new retroviruses capable
of infecting man out of those already known to be carcinogenic or liable
to cause immunodeficiencies or brain diseases in other mammals was already
well developed and widely published by the beginning of the 70's. Many
of the scientists now researching into AIDS previously worked in the oncology
laboratories where the techniques were first developed : Gallo, Essex,
Heseltine (U.S); Weiss, Jarret (U.K); Montagnier (France); Zhdanov, Lapin
(USSR); Ddinhardt (Germany); etc."</i></blockquote>
The point of this quotation is not only to give the names of some of the
assassins who doubtless managed to produce the monstrosities that we are
talking about here. This statement by John Seale, member of the British
Royal College of Physicians, published in the "New Scientist" of January
1987, illustrates, along with thousands of other examples, the fact that
by the early 70's molecular biology had the means to invent and produce
retroviruses capable of attacking the human immune system.
<p>In 1969, in parallel with the resurgence of research into oncology,
American scientists identified "reverse transcriptase". Don't panic! This
Latin word is no more than the mysterious name given by modern wizards
to describe an enzyme (enzyme = a protein involved in controlling the initiation,
inhibition and rate of many different chemical reactions in the body; it's
a biological catalyst) particular to retroviruses, allowing them to translate
their RNA into DNA. Up until this time, Science had claimed with rigid
conviction that only the converse was possible, ie the translation of DNA
into RNA. The identification of reverse transcriptase has permitted the
development of techniques for molecular cloning, ie the production of genetic
monsters. This is what we are going to try and explain.
<p>The principal dogma of molecular biology up until then was that it was
impossible (and thus heresy!) to think of translating RNA genes into DNA
(14). With this "discovery" (15) a whole new revolutionary method was opened
up for medicine and "humanity" to, for example, adapt retroviruses specific
to animal tumours to the human cell.
<p><b><u>Retro</u></b>viruses are RNA viruses whose specificity lies in
their capacity to transcribe their RNA into DNA and then to transmit the
DNA into a host cell. The identification of the retroviral enzyme, reverse
transcriptase, made it technically possible to insert the virus at the
heart of the genetic material of the cell (human or animal), permitting
incredible new methods for genetic manipulation and cloning in molecular
biology, as well as lucrative commercial enterprise.
<p>Making no apology for repeating ourselves, we want to make sure that
the full scale and horror of these weapons that have thus been put in the
hands of licensed madmen is understood. We must emphasise that research
into retroviruses is not the result of a "brainwave" by a particular scientist,
but that the widespread fascination with the "reverse transcriptase" technique
is directly linked to the fact that it has made it so easy to create all
sorts of hybrids, retroviruses among them, something that was impossible
a few years earlier. When it was realised that retroviruses could translate
their RNA into DNA a whole new world of possibilities for cloning was opened
up.
<blockquote><i>"In 1971, an amazing confirmation of the unique role of
reverse transcriptase came with the demonstration of "infective DNA" (ie
capable of infecting) within cells infected by retroviruses. When inserted
into uninfected cells this DNA reproduces the virus, ie it carries the
virus's genetic code."</i></blockquote>
Since then it has been possible, however clumsily, to produce genetic monsters
by way of retroviruses. A few years later, between 1979 and 1981 (the incubation
period of HIV!), the first cases of a rare type of pneumonia began to appear
in California: it didn't take long for the white coated terrorists to announce
that it was related to a new and original retrovirus. AIDS had started
to grow in the horrendous garden of Science...and its emergence coincided
exactly (we can never repeat this enough!) with the discovery of the existence
of retroviruses and the possibility of cloning them. In order to clarify
things a bit further, to make sure that the full extent of the catastrophe
brought about by hideous experiments in molecular biology is understood,
we want to try and explain how commercial stakes in laboratory research
changed when reverse transcriptase came on the scene. Commercial interests
were without doubt the driving force behind research into retroviruses
and this provided a favourable climate for the "hatching" of HIV (whether
accidental or deliberate is of little interest to us).
<p>The pharmaceutical industry - real dictators, commanders and suppliers
of capital for everything related to scientific research - has been actively
researching ways to produce low-cost (to the manufacturer, of course!)
human and animal substances. Like all capitalists, the management of a
pharmaceutical company produces "medicines" (16), not to "treat", but to
increase capital.
<p>For a drug to be profitable, as with all commodities, a certain degree
of human labour must be inherent in its production: the pharmaceutical
industry would hardly be interested in egg white alone, presented as medicine
(17)! On the other hand, production costs cannot be allowed to reach a
level that would make the drug prohibitively expensive. Capitalists are
not interested in products that cannot be commercialised.
<p>Another determining factor in the race for profit between capitalists
is the unbridled research into ways of <b>producing the same commodity
at a lower cost.</b> To this end, industrialists are permanently researching
different technology (a new machine, a new technique,...) which will permit
them to turn the foundations of productive forces in the production of
a particular commodity upside down. In effect, if a capitalist possesses
a machine that allows him to produce a given article with a smaller amount
of human labour than his competitors, he will not only be able to "<b>corner
the market</b>" by selling it at a slightly reduced rate, but he will also
- and above all - realise an <b>extraordinnary surplus value</b>, because
the world market will continue to estimate the social labour time required
for production of the commodity from a worldwide point of view. This means
that his particular laboratory will produce, during each hour of labour,
commodities which are equivalent to much more than one hour of labour elsewhere
on the world market. In other words, an hour of labour in this laboratory
will produce far more value (and thus a far greater appropriation of surplus-value)
than other labs...for as long as it takes their competitors to get hold
of the same technological advances!
<p>There is a product (sorry, a poison!), interferon, whose present production
costs are at least as high as its toxicity, which is marketed as a treatment
for cancer. The purchaser pays $150 per day and only stops the treatment
when the side effects become worse than the cancer! The whole business
is extremely profitable for the pharmaceutical industry (18).
<p>As long as capitalists producing this commodity have recourse to the
same science and are faced with the same production problems, the situation
remains static. In certain periods, <u>it is not in their interest for
things to develop</u>, because it would be too blatant a contradiction
within the global development of whichever branch of the economy (19).
However now, doubtless because it is no longer possible to silence the
multiple contradictions arising out of the DNA dogma and also because competition
demands it, capitalists producing interferon are seeing their productive
forces turned completely upside down by the discovery of reverse transcriptase
and its ability to translate RNA into DNA. It is now possible to produce
interferon in large quantities and the pharmaceutical capitalists are jostling
one another to put the multiple applications of this "discovery" into practice
(interferon is not the only one, of course!) and to put themselves in a
position to benefit from this extraordinary, though short-lived surplus
value!
<p>We are briefly and as simply as possible, going to describe the difficulties
that the pharmaceutical capitalists previously came up against in synthesising
biological molecules.
<p>In order to make bacteria (unicellular organisms) produce substances
(proteins, that will become the active substance in a medicine) it is necessary
to graft onto the bacteria a part of the genome (genetic material) of a
cell normally producing the protein, although in small quantities.
<p>The researcher is confronted with many sizeable problems, the biggest
of which is the <b>difficulty in isolating the DNA sequence enabling production
of the protein</b>. DNA is translated into messenger RNA and this mRNA
is then read to produce the protein. However here, the researcher is faced
with an astronomical number of different sequences (each one coding for
a specific protein) amongst which ONLY ONE sequence will give the finished
product, the desired protein. The mind boggles when contemplating the search
for a few dozen sequences amongst millions.
<p>It is in this field that reverse transcriptase brought to the pharmaceutical
capitalist what the steam engine brought to the industrialist. In effect,
reverse transcriptase is an enzyme of viral origin (coming from a retrovirus)
permitting the synthesis of DNA from RNA. mRNA can be isolated much more
easily than the DNA sequence in the genome first, because it is produced
in far greater quantities than the DNA which only carries the desired sequence
once and second, because, in the majority of cases, a single protein corresponds
to one mRNA.
<p>Therefore, our pharmaceutical capitalist who had to find the DNA sequence
corresponding to the protein, with all the difficulties that that entailed,
now only needs to isolate mRNA, let reverse transcriptase act on it to
translate it into DNA which can then be used directly to graft onto bacteria.
<p>It can thus be seen that reverse transcriptase, in addition to permitting
the manipulations that we have mentioned above, is an enormous financial,
commercial and economic (euphemistically known as "scientific" in specialist
journals) asset to capitalism, permitting the emergence of innumerable
poisons that will soon be sold to us as medicines.
<p>We will now go on to demonstrate the fervour with which scientists worked
to master this enzyme, the source of such profit.
<p>From 1971 onwards, when reverse transcriptase's specific activity was
identified, American oncologists threw themselves into fevered research
and hunted down the famous enzyme in patients that they had under their
thumbs. In 1970, Robert Gallo, of the National Cancer Institute in Bethseda,
USA, identified and isolated reverse transcriptase in the white blood cells
of leukaemia sufferers. In 1971, Stuart Aronson modified a specific mouse
tumour retrovirus, extended its infective gene sequence and adapted it
to human cells.
<p>The same year, scientists managed to cleave a macaque virus, aiming
to stick half of it onto a cleaved "bacteria digester" known as Lambda.
This molecule was to be inserted into E.Coli, one of the bacteria present
in normal human intestines. Imagine the damage if this genetically engineered
molecule were, "by accident", to escape from the lab and find its way back
to man! The official version of history is that certain scientists, enemies
of Progress, prevented the project from reaching completion. In fact, they
just wanted to move on! Other projects came to light and, what is certain
is that, by 1971 it was possible to produce genetic jigsaws. A new kind
of craftsman, armed with his scalpel (restriction enzymes), his transfer
enzymes ("transcriptase" to translate DNA into RNA and reverse transcriptase
to do the opposite) and his electron microscope, the molecular biologist
is able to launch his attack on viruses, retroviruses and bacteria, cleaving
them, assembling and reassembling them and testing them on human embryos
(the most expensive) or on monkeys.
<p>In 1972, the World Health Organisation (an agency directly dependent
on the UN, and hence mainly on the USA) published an issue of their journal
demanding that work be started to study the effects of certain viruses
on the immune system, in particular the effects of infection on T lymphocytes
(20). This is a further example to illustrate that the manipulations of
viruses and retroviruses, whether hybrid or not, have not been carried
out by alchemists who have strayed from the common path, but are the direct
result of work by the most highly trained (to poison us better!) scientists
under the leadership of the world's most prestigious medical men and women.
<p>Does this give us a good enough idea as to the origins of this biological
Chernobyl that scientists have subjected us to? No!
<p>In the same year, experimentation upon human beings was announced at
the 7th conference of the National Cancer Institute:
<blockquote><i>"The biology of cancer makes it necessary to study human
beings using observational methods of the same degree of sophistication
characterising animal experiments", explained Dr John Higginson, director
of the National Agency for Cancer Research in Lyon. "Let it be clear that
these techniques "characterising animal experiments" included the inoculation
of the disease!"</i> (21)</blockquote>
That year, 1972, in the "Jewish Chronic Disease Hospital" in Brooklyn,
cancerous tissues were transplanted into men without their knowledge (22).
<p>In 1974, they "successfully" grafted a gene onto a recently fertilized
mouse egg: the foreign gene was transmitted hereditarily. They also managed
to "successfully" grow sheep visna virus and bovine leukaemia virus in
a human cell.
<p>Our description of the infinite horrors of recombinant genetics, gene
grafting, monstrous couplings of animal viruses with human cells and criminal
and hazardous tests... stops here. To avoid getting indigestion we are
now going to consider how ethical problems, moral anxieties and debates
between the 'hawks' and 'doves' of Science and Progress raised by these
experiments only represent a further step towards unrestrained experimentation.
In the same way that the establishment of peace is necessary for the outbreak
of war, conferences organised by scientists to decide whether all of this
carries a danger of introducing genetic crap into the human system of heredity
actually constitute the most efficient trampoline from which to launch
research, unleashed!
<p>It was along these lines that a conference was held in Asilomar and
these hypocrites questioned the risks posed by genetic recombinations.
A year long moratorium was imposed, but during a second Asilomar conference
they made a ruling: it was necessary to protect the learned, the technicians
as well as the human race! What a joke! Boots, gloves and helmets became
regulation and varying levels of security were defined according to the
degree of danger of the experiments...and everybody threw themselves back
into fevered molecular biology research. Morality and ethics were redefined
to serve better serve commercial and military. The learned fools of the
human race, are financially dependent upon laboratories and the main laboratories
are all placing their bets upon molecular biology. So, here we go!
<p>The demand for human cells has become enormous. "Flow", "Microbiological
of Walkerville" and "C of Maryland" are the three giant companies supplying
labs, fighting tooth and nail to corner the market. In 7 years, "Flow"
alone imported 12,000 pairs of kidneys from South Korea, vivisected from
children removed prematurely by caesarian section in the third trimester
of pregnancy. "Flow" is a subsidiary of the "General Research Corp.", which
is involved in strategic research for the Pentagon and whose president
admits that "organs have been bought to carry out organic cultures for
medical research". "<i>In Singapore and Switzerland</i>", explains George
Wald, Nobel prize winner in Medicine, hardly likely to be suspected of
sympathizing with us anti-progressivists, <i>"we have estimated the number
of 'products of abortion' imported by the US between 1969 and 1978 at around
80,000"</i> (23).
<p>Commercially, with this 'boom' in molecular biology, the human cell
has become an excellent commodity. Companies are being set up, competition
is going all out, stimulating Science. Firms are springing up (Cetus, Genentech,
Biogene...) and are centring their activities around products of recombinant
genetics.
<p>They are always lead by those who are known as the brains of the world,
the most famous geneticists, the popes of molecular biology, the avant-garde
of cancer research.
<p>The market for molecular biology is ripe. Ever since the synthesis of
the first gene in 1972, the molecular electronics sector has attracted
computer firms and constitutes a major industrial and strategic stake.
To mention only one of these giants, IBM is interested in attempts to replace
silicon, an essential substance for information storage, with organic materials
such as protein chains or enzymes, manipulated bacteria or viruses, etc,...
<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">War and Commerce, the driving forces of Science
!</font></u></h2>
Without going into all the new commercial demands of molecular biology
since the blossoming of the genetic jigsaw, it is necessary to mention
the jewel in the crown of research, one of the most important sources of
finance for all these experiments, the real and historical motor of science:
the Army.
<p>The arms market has been interested in molecular electronics right from
the beginning. The research is financed by enormous amounts of capital
and projects are approved one after the other. They obviously remain secret,
but all sorts of applications are tried and tested. The applications that
are most dangerous to us clearly remain the property of the Army and a
law was passed in 1969 to ensure that this monopoly is maintained without
exception.
<p>As with all laws, amendments are presented as a defence of the common
good, although they actually sanction assassins draped in patriotic colours
to produce and test the effectiveness of the genetic monsters they have
created:
<blockquote><i>"... none of the funding granted should be used for open
air trials of deadly chemical agents, neither of microorganisms causing
disease, nor biological toxins (...), <b>unless the Ministry of Defence,
authorized by the US President, confirms that the test is necessary for
national security.</b>"</i></blockquote>
The retrovirus tops the bill in all this research because, as we have seen
earlier, <b><u>it is - by way of reverse transcriptase - the essential
and ideal vector for incorporation into other genomes</u>.</b>
<p>Delegates from the Pentagon were already announcing the future direction
of their research into viral "collages" by 1969:
<blockquote><i>"During the coming 5 to 10 years it will probably be possible
to produce a new infective organism which may be considerably different
from all known pathogenic micro-organisms."</i></blockquote>
They went on, in front of the Congress's credit commission:
<blockquote><i>"The importance of these germs is that they may be resistant
to the immunological and therapeutic measures upon which we depend to keep
ourselves relatively protected from infectious diseases."</i></blockquote>
Must we look any further to find the origin of the viral bomb-blast of
HIV? And let us make it quite clear that it was not the result of a momentary
aberration by a more machiavellian tendency (24) at the heart of the US
State. Biological weapons had been envisaged for decades and the recruitment
of the retrovirus dates back to 1952, when the techniques for its "rearrangement"
and reproduction had not yet been developed. At this time, in Ottowa, it
was envisaged as an agent for foot-and-mouth disease to destroy enemy herds.
<p>Between 1976 and 1977, parliamentary enquiries took place in the US
and revealed that a biological research programme had started in 1963 in
the Fort Detrick military laboratory, using deadly infectious agents and
neurotoxins. During this period, one molecular biologist, one electrician
and an employee in the monkey section of Fort Detrick mysteriously died.
<p>As we can see, the joyful achievements that we are lead to by medical
research are the result of lengthy research, directly financed and directed
by the State. The example of the USA is particularly telling, when one
understands the avant-garde function of the local organisation of the bourgeois
state in this part of the world. Progress in molecular biology directly
and permanently interests American scientists and militarists.
<p>It should be clear, at this stage of the text, that the separation between
scientist, industrialist and militarist is an artificial one; research
into molecular biology, more specifically centred on military applications,
are inextricably linked with medical research. Fort Detrick, the military
laboratory of the US army, near Washington in Maryland, is directly attached
to and linked to the National Cancer Institute in Bethseda, a suburb of
the American capital. To strengthen our argument we have put a short extract
of a list of high-powered American scientists in this text, supported by
the positions they occupy on the Administrative Councils of major pharmaceutical
trusts and the links uniting them with the military domain.
<p>As for the security standards decreed during the shameful conferences
in Asilomar, these were set up by the National Institute for Health itself,
defining four different types of laboratory of which the most highly protected,
known as "P4", is also the best equipped...and the most "militarized":
the first of these labs opened in 1977, in the same building as Fort Detrick,
conceived and built by "Vickers" weapons factory.

In short, it can be seen that Science and War merge into one, the learned
and the militarists rowing together on the galley of Progress and Medicine!
Cancer research is an essential support for the development of a cover
permitting advances in military destructive technology. It is also a source
of power, prestige and money for medical careerists (25). In the field
of medical research, the scientist is King! War is the historical motor
of Science: Progress never advances faster than it does in wartime and
in this domain, research has no limits.
<p>Whilst oncologists were studying the immune system, in particular between
1970 and 1975, research was being lead in parallel towards the discovery
of a weapon of mass destruction:
<blockquote><i>"We know that American researchers concentrated on the question
of whether or not it is possible to produce a kind of chemical or biological
weapon that could kill people of one race and leave others more or less
unscathed. These are what are known as "ethnic weapons". Certainly, techniques
in genetics and molecular biology permit the development of these type
of weapons."</i></blockquote>
This statement is no more from 'Paris-Match' than it is from the pages
of a leftist rag. It is a statement made in 1983 by a renowned biologist,
Seven Rose, of the British Open University's department for research into
the brain.
<p>It doubtless doesn't take many "brains" to spend one's life torturing
monkeys and sheep to extract molecular hybrids. It requires even less "humanity",
when crazed (but commercial) research by the pharmaceutical industry and
other state agents leads to "ethnic weapons"! Scientific progress can no
longer take us by surprise, in the face of the ever deepening chaos of
this moribund society, only just able to regenerate itself through war.
<p>Research into methods of destruction, orchestrated by the State, is
permanent and goes back to the origins of class societies. However society
has never before attained the current degree of barbarity. Where human
reasoning remains, they would have us believe that a limit has been reached
in the destruction of the human race and the planet that supports it: however
Capital's infernal progress always proves them wrong. Just when you think
that the maximum of what is organically and materially possible for man
to bear has been reached, that Capital can go no further in its savage
destruction of human minds and bodies, a new development comes and shatters
this illusion.
<p>Value devours everything! The State puts proletarians in the position
where the sale of their labour alone is not enough to survive and forces
them to sell their own organs.
<p>The requirements of Science and Commerce push human limits ever further,
profiting from the proletarians' worsening living conditions. Freedom to
buy and sell is the basis of democracy: why not then trade in human organs
that others freely choose to sell (26)?
<p>Chemical and biological weapons, ethnic weapons, buying (by Science)
and selling human organs (to survive)... We could go on and discuss "Zyklon"
pesticides, gases which were used as weapons, the scientists, who created
them with such care and attention, always able to claim after the massacre
that they never intended them to be used like that. We could talk about
all the poisons put in storage for many years, which the laboratories,
always on the look-out for new ways of making profit, are bringing back
out today, thanks to AIDS (27). We could describe the horror of the scientific
executions of those on death row in the USA, etc.,but no further lists
of the barbarity created by the insatiable appetite for buying and selling
could be enough to open anyone's eyes. What's the point of relating additional
horrors, when the <b>very existence</b> of worldwide capitalist Democracy
produces the monstrous contradiction of starving more than 120 thousand
people to death every day, whilst at the same time, the law of Value forces
capitalists to destroy tonnes and tonnes of food?
<p>This fact alone reveals the true horror of the mass-grave on which we
live and no amount of "consciousness raising" can change the reality: only
worldwide organisation and growing links between revolts springing from
the permanent degradation of the proletariat's living conditions can put
an end to the capitalist apocalypse.
<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">The AIDS virus is not an accident !</font></u></h2>
In this short description of the context in which Scientific research has
orientated itself in recent years, we have emphasized the simultaneous
appearance of AIDS and the technological ability to produce it. There are
more specific and very coherent articles which give a fuller account of
the actual process leading to the production of HIV (28). We cannot delay
ourselves further by attempting to prove what the facts prove alone: <b><u>it's
not a coincidence that such a spectacularly virulent and fatal virus appeared
at a time when the technology existed to produce it.</u></b> At least we
will not die stupid as long as we denounce the true criminals at the origin
of this epidemic: the scientists!
<p>The State covers it up quite badly, and maximum embarrassment is caused
by the "taboo" question of whether it's technically possible to produce
HIV. In order to deny its scientific origins, Science's disciples only
have one answer: "what possible interest could there be in developing a
virus against which we cannot protect ourselves?!" For these medical priests,
HIV does not meet the criteria for effectiveness with malicious intent,...
and could not, therefore, have been produced by society!
<p>Science continually sings the praises of the ideology of "objectivity"
and luckily this has had an effect on some of them. When, in 1987, a journalist
bluntly asked whether <i>"if HIV did not exist, would it be possible to
create it?", Dr.Brun-Vezinet replied "Yes, we can!"</i>. Professor Montagnier
answered <i>"Yes, we could"</i>. Dr.Chermann sat on the fence and Dr.Alizon
denied the possibility... although in explaining why not, actually admitted
that, if one thought hard about it, <i>"it would be possible to produce
an even more infectious agent, by preserving the viral envelope capable
of recognising lymphocytes and using it to produce a much more pathogenic
virus such as the 'flu virus; this could cause epidemics spreading like
wildfire"</i> (29).
<p>It is thus impossible to deny that Science is capable of producing similar
viruses, but even those who admit this to us put their white coats back
on and ask us solemnly to disregard the poisons they create, to forget
their commercial and military function, to ignore the innumerable cock-ups
made in their labs, to clear our minds of the collusion between Cancer
Research and National Defence Institutes, to stop thinking about the microbiological
demons they continue to conceive...and to believe in the Holy Crusade of
Science!
<p>It's like listening to the worshippers of whichever god explaining that
if you don't believe, it's because you have no faith, and if you want the
faith...you have to believe. Religion promises us Paradise if we keep our
mouths shut on earth; and Science assures us of a cure if we submit ourselves
and close our eyes to it! Science and Religion are part of the same family:
Value. The State. They have both always played a part in maintaining the
status quo, either by way of preservation or adjustment of the worldwide
system. One of the ways in which they try to do this is by lying outright,
concealing reality because it is too powerful in decredibilising the State.
<p>In February 1991 it was revealed that children between 6 and 15 years
old were regularly raped by about 20 priests at a Catholic Convent near
Montreal between 1950 and 1970. The police had known about it from the
beginning, but the State had denied and covered up the facts in order to
impose christian order, necessary for the coherence of the local State
at the time. The same thing is happening as regards AIDS today, but the
consequences of "confessing" are far heavier as there is much more at stake.
Science is already accused of impotence, faced with the impossibility of
curing; where would it be if the connection between society's military
projects and the appearance of this worldwide epidemic were made public?
The hideous Health representatives prefer to recite their moral litany,
encouraging "prevention" as regards sexual excesses "which, for the most
part, do not increase satisfaction, but on the contrary, lead to serious
risks such as AIDS," as put by Professor Montagnier of the Pasteur Institute
in Paris (30).
<p>Today, discussions concerning the origin of AIDS have been more or less
stifled by medical ideological enterprise. The most recent argument used
to stave off any attempts to revive this issue consists of giving prime
importance to finding practical solutions to AIDS: "Discussing the origin
of AIDS is philosophizing, what we need are concrete solutions". Thus the
race for research and profit is justified. The medical stampede can continue,
determined more than ever by commercial competition, exacerbated as the
capitalist crisis deepens day by day.
<p>In the face of this, we had to break down the wall of silence built
by the scientific State and resite the AIDS epidemic in the real context
in which it appeared: the worldwide capitalist race for ever increasingly
concentrated accumulation of Value.
<p><b><u>The AIDS virus is not an accident!</u></b>
<p>Whether it is the result of an error during laboratory manipulations,
a hybrid produced by a brain driven mad by Science or the direct result
of crazed search for yet another weapon to add to the teeming armamentarium
of those paranoid in the Defence of the Nation, matters little. Whatever
the case, the AIDS retrovirus is the product of a society made ill by money,
competition and commerce! AIDS is not a God-sent plague to remind us of
morality. AIDS is the result of the infernal logic that human beings have
suffered since Value became autonomous by way of a law submitting every
human relationship, all new knowledge, all creative activity...to the strict
dictatorship of the world market.
<p>The laws of the market impose a permanent war between us all. Capitalists
tear each other apart to corner the market and they mercilessly submit
the very people they exploit -the proletarians- to the same war: "If you
want a wage you must fight your competitors on the Labour Market!" In this
war of all against all, Capital's self-limiting mechanism (the production
of more surplus value than it is capable of realising) tends to be overruled
by the infernal competition between market competitors; this race for profit
leads them to conceive and develop "revolutionary" productive forces in
all fields, permitting them to dominate one or other sector of the market
by selling at lower cost.
<p>Progress and Science thus rub shoulders with Commerce by submitting
human consciousness to the same market dictatorship. Science only functions
and develops thanks to massive funding of research along the lines intended
by capitalists - research into developing the most effective weapon, to
satisfy the cravings of whichever capitalist association, baptized "Nation".
Research into machines, knowledge or techniques to yield the best production.
Research to be the first to launch a drug able to relieve headaches completely
or to bring about hair regrowth onto the market!
<p><b><u>The AIDS virus is not an accident!</u></b>
<p>It is the result of unbridled research by Science, under the orders
of Commerce, responding to the market needs of the pharmaceutical industry,
bionics, molecular electronics, computing, etc,...
<p>Science is not an accident either. Science is the product, and agent,
of Capital. Science is the negation of human knowledge, in that its development
is based on the need for capitalist development. It exists as the negation
of Humankind, seeking to submit every discovery, every experience, all
knowledge to the democratic dictatorship of Commodity and the State defending
it.
<p>It doesn't matter to them that the medicines they create are tested
with fatal consequences on human beings who accept the tests because they
have no other means to live or because they no longer have the strength
to protest: the aim of Science is Commerce! The function of Science...
is Ignorance: by elevating itself to the level of a divine sect next to
the State that finances it, Science takes on, maintains and directs the
separation between human beings and the knowledge that is vital to them.
In this way the proletariat remains ignorant of the enemy, the total antagonism:
Capital. It is impossible to describe the inhumanity to which the proletariat
is subjected: if we have a headache, it is not because we have worked eight
hours a day,... but because we need aspirin!

<h3>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">Notes</font></u></h3>
1. At the time of going to press, the world media announced, on the basis
of a 3 year study on 1749 patients: "There is no difference in the rate
of progression to a more serious or final stage of the disease between
those taking AZT and those not." (Lib&eacute;ration, Le Monde,... 2.4.93)
<p>Since the mid 80's, nearly 10 years now, the same media broadcast reassuring
"medical" information that AZT was the only way to combat the fatal progression
of AIDS. In retrospect, it may be easier to imagine how the "pressures"
we talk about in the introduction materialized. The doctors absolved themselves
of responsibility as soon as they heard that our comrade refused, against
their advice, to take AZT. Those close to him were practically treated
like assassins because of their refusal to support "specialist medical
advice", the doctors continuing to terrorize them to the point of specifying
the time scale by which his death would be brought forward if their advice
was not taken... This constitutes the dictatorship of Value for the imposition
of its commodities on human beings.
<p>2. If a further example is needed to illustrate this collusion, it is
enough to recall the recent publicity surrounding the contaminated batches
of blood which the French Blood Transfusion Centre continued to distribute
to haemophiliacs, because it was in their financial interest to do so.
But let's not be fooled: the media latches onto a particular story in order
to increase the credibility of the whole of Science and the State. When
the press reveals cock-ups made by the Police or Scientists, denouncing
one or the other as being "irresponsible", it does so with the aim of justifying
the very existence of the Police and murderous Medicine.
<p>3. It is clear that future society, communist society, will require
knowledge, as a structured explanation of phenomena and will find it necessary
to transmit this knowledge both geographically and down through generations...
But we very much doubt that the term "Science" will be retained. It is
so loaded with historical bourgeois significance that even if it is brought
down to its neutral etymological origin, "exact knowledge of things", it
still could not be used, just as the term "Religion" originally refers
to the "natural link of human beings with nature and with each other",
but which is far too loaded with bourgeois significance to ever be used
otherwise.
<p>4. The same thing goes for Scientific as it does for other information.
Generally, when discussing class struggle we only have a few paragraphs
at our disposal, robbed of their originality, describing the content of
the struggle in terms of numbers of dead. In the same way, to write this
text on AIDS we had to read between the lines, absorb opposing points of
view in order to destroy them, collect true personal accounts, so much
richer than any stories told in the magazines, read pages and pages of
disgusting crap, steeped in Knowledge, to reveal contradictions and expose
what has been obscured...A task made even more arduous by its being a poorly
accessible domain, not only from the point of view of the taboo of scientific
Knowledge, but also because of the mindless logic that inevitably clouds
the issue around such matters.
<p>5. This scientific disguise is used today to permit any old clown to
make propaganda for whichever suncream or toothpaste. There is no doubt
that science sells; above all, there is also no doubt that the common man
is convinced by this circus to exchange his life for shiny, coloured mirrors.
<p>6. Copernicus and Galileo went much further than this, without realizing
it. In making the Earth turn around the Sun, they theoretically prolonged
the influence that the nascent bourgeoisie had upon the lords. The Earth
ceased to be the centre of the world and God, the centre of creation. The
feudal lords thus lost their divine status. They began to favour the emergence
of the new god of the new dominant class: Science.
<p>7. The very conservative "Ordre des M&eacute;decins" in France, well
specialised in all sorts of witch-hunts, can no longer conceal that "there
is no doubt that the medicine of the 18th century killed more people than
it cured". This statement appeared a few years ago in France in the "Quotidien
du M&eacute;decin", a French medical journal.
<p>8. As often happens, etymology reveals the deep meaning of a word that
modern society has tried to alter. "Patient", from the Latin "patiens",
means <i>"he who is made to suffer"</i>, a derivation from the Latin "pati"
(to suffer). One of the French definitions of "patient" includes the unchanged
origin from the Latin: <i>"a person who is subjected to or will be subjected
to torture"</i> (Petit Robert 1990).
<p>9. Messing about with cells from monkeys is very common in biology.
Green monkeys are used for, amongst other things, the production of vaccines,
something which points to the fact that if there ever has been a link between
HIV and Green monkeys, it would have stemmed directly from the manipulations
of the laboratory technocrats' snowy-white and "clean" hands, rather than
from the "perverted lust" of Africans, as implied by judeo-christian racist
morality.
<p>10. Some scientists even go so far as claiming that HIV originated in
Space! An astrophysicist from the University of Wales, Chandra Wickramasinghe,
has been working for years on the cosmic origins of certain illnesses,
such as 'flu, and claims that HIV could have come from Space. However spectacular
his thesis, it at least shows that he has ruled out the possibility of
any other earthly origin apart from laboratory production: <i>"The AIDS
virus either escaped form a laboratory or it comes from Space."</i> (El
Pais, 24/12/1992)
<p>11. Recently, in a Swiss magazine, we saw a brilliant example of this
kind of contradiction within the proletariat. Under the threat of the deportation
of all her family, an immigrant mother, terrorised by the Immigration Office,
stated: <i>"I know that there is freedom here in Switzerland, but when
the doorbell rings, I tremble."</i>
<p>12. Out of 288,377 cases of AIDS recorded by the WHO from the start
of the epidemic until the end of 1990, 50% have been in the US and 25%
in 45 African countries. Even though statistics often conceal the essential
from us, these ones nevertheless go some way to correct the currently accepted
viewpoint that Africa is the most infected continent, an opinion which
corroborates western racist theories.
<p>13. A hybrid is a genetic monster made up of several cell varieties
with different genetic origins.
<p>14. A few months before reverse transcriptase proved its existence in
Science's sceptical eyes, Jacques Monod, considered to be one of the great
masters of modern science, defended the prevailing dogma of DNA in his
book "Coincidence and Necessity", stating that <i>"it has never been observed,
nor is it conceivable, that the information could ever be transferred in
the opposite direction"</i>. The ridicule killed him!
<p>15. We have put "discovery" in brackets because it is necessary to realise
that many researchers had been opposed to this scientific dogma for a long
time (for example, Beljanski, in France, was banned from the Pasteur Institute),
but they were denied research funding because they refused to submit themselves
to the medical and scientific Inquisition's dogma! Today, the same people
who previously defended the "holy dogma", describe the "discovery" of enzymes
capable of using viral DNA, as a mould for synthesising DNA, as revolutionary.
<p>16. The use value of pharmaceutical products is subsumed at this point
by exchange value, which could more objectively be referred to as "poison"
than "medicine"!
<p>17. The example of egg white is not deliberately provocative! There
<u>is</u>
an antiviral agent (AL 721) which is very accessible and can be isolated
in egg white, but which is not profitable enough for the pharmaceutical
industry. They would only show interest if the amount of labour force crystallised
within the product allowed its commercialisation as a commodity with a
significant enough degree of surplus value!
<p>18. Discovered in 1957 and marketed as an anti-cancer agent, interferon
enabled the capitalists who patented it to make intermittent business out
of it, each time justified by research. For 15 years, the labs that were
experimenting on it received heavy funding. Always tested on cancer sufferers,
the economic performance of interferon was inversely proportional to the
state of health of the guinea-pigs: in the early 70's it had to be shelved.
<p>But then genetic manipulations came into play and rekindled interest
and funding for the product. Speculation began, shares were soaring! A
publicity campaign began to establish research into it, but soon interest
(financial!) dropped off again because it became public knowledge that
when treatment is stopped cancer cells proliferate! Happily for the product's
shareholders, HIV came on the scene and gave another justification for
bringing the poison out of the cupboard!
<p>19. This is how a good doctor, full of illusions about the purity of
the world he thought he was entering into, has ended up living under-cover
somewhere in Columbia, with killers hired by pharmaceutical trusts hot
on his heels. This doctor developed an effective vaccine against hepatitis
B, but refused to give his patent up to one of the powerful multinationals.
Naive, he intended to give his vaccine to a non-governmental and third-worldist
organisation so that, as he believed, the vaccine could be produced at
low cost and therefore be available to the poorest populations of Asia
and Africa.
<p>20. T lymphocytes are one of the main types of lymphocytes; these are
a category of white cells with a so-called "specific" immune function,
because they selectively recognise the substance threatening the organism.
They print antigens into their memory and can therefore respond immediately
the next time they are exposed to a given antigen. Amongst these T lymphocytes
("T" because they are produced via the thymus gland), "T4" lymphocytes
coordinate and direct the overall defence. Their outer membrane carries
the OKT4 molecule, upon which the AIDS retrovirus attaches a corresponding
part of its envelope, thus entering, as if sucked in from the inside.
<p>21. "Tristes chim&egrave;res", Rolande Girard (1987).
<p>22. Today this practice of ruthless experimentation is under control,
subjected to international legislation... and is thus generalised! In order
to put someone who is terminally ill into a trial, the laboratory has to
obtain permission from an "Ethics Committee" (yes, yes, "ethics"!), which
is in fact a committee of the hospital establishment in which the trial
will take place. In order to reassure their relatives, the labs extort
"consent" in the form of a signature from the patient...unless this unofficial
trial is already part of a "protocol" accepted by international legislation.
<blockquote><i>"In this way all trials will either be massive yet controlled;
or ruthless yet legal. The State legislates the tautology between a citizen
made ill by one world and a world which sees the illness it produces as
a guaranteed endless industrial challenge. The methods used by those who
are given the right to carry out research can be seen, in the long term,
to be as damaging as the illness itself. Thus, radiation produces tumours,
which are destroyed by radiation, which will give rise to other tumours,
etc..."</i></blockquote>

<blockquote>Extract from "N'Dr&eacute;a", published by "Os Cangaceiros",
February '92.</blockquote>
23. A vile trade in human organs is developing throughout the world, kidneys
being most in demand: nearly 10,000 people are awaiting kidney transplants.
Tradesmen are therefore hunting for kidneys. An Anatolian peasant, living
in Istanbul, recently had his kidney removed, having thought he had just
signed a contract for a job in London. He received $4000 damages, although
the cost of the operation for the recipient came to $100,000, the difference
ending up in the pockets of the surgeons and middle-men. The scandal was
such that the white butchers were "sentenced"... to working in the National
Health Service alone, with a temporary ban on working in the private sector!
<p>The kidney is not the only possible source of profit. In Bogota, Columbia,
children have their eyes enucleated in the slums and the hospitals: Porto
Rico, Guadeloupe and Miami are subsidiaries in the commercialisation of
organs -the worldwide capitalist market sees gold even in the gaze of children!
<p>24. It is wrong to label as "machiavellian" those who are only stating
loud and clear what Capital demands of them. Thus, Robert McNamara, president
of the World Bank and ex US Secretary of State (he ordered massive bomb
attacks on Vietnam) spoke openly about the methods of struggle against
what he calls "galloping demography":
<blockquote><i>"Epidemic illnesses are a natural way of reducing the population
(...). We must take draconian measures for demographic reduction against
the will of the population. It has proved impossible or insufficient to
reduce birth rates. It is therefore necessary to increase death rates.
How? By natural methods: Famine and sickness."</i></blockquote>
25. As the graffiti on the walls of the Villejuifjunior doctors' on-call
room goes: "more people live off cancer than die from it!"
<p>26. What could be more normal than the American democratic model being,
once again, the sword defending private property, right down to its bodily
and organic manifestations? A recent judgment by the Californian Supreme
Court recognised that everyone has property rights over their body and
thus accepts that parts of it can be freely commercialised. The freedom
to have one's body at one's disposal can not be denied by the State. Proletarian
in hardship, democracy protects you: you have the right to sell your kidney!
Who could still claim that the present day salaried slave is superior to
the slave of Antiquity?
<p>27. We want to talk about AZT - zidovudine - which is extremely toxic.
Peter Duesberg, a professor of Molecular Biology, not one to criticize
science much normally, stated the following:
<blockquote><i>"I think that AZT is AIDS on prescription. This substance
prevents the process of replication of DNA within cells, thus blocking
not only the multiplication of the HIV virus, but at the same time destroying
all reproducing cells, particularly those of the immune system. AZT is
not only useless but fatal."</i></blockquote>
28. The AIDS virus, according to one of these theories, is a hybrid resulting
from <u>assembling the VISNA virus</u> (a "lentivirus" responsible for
a brain disease in sheep, largely in Island, and which, like HIV, is characterised
by its extremely long incubation period) <u>with part of HTLV-1 attached
to it</u> (HTLV-1 is a widespread virus in Northern Japan and causes lymphoproliferative
cancers in humans). In order to defend their theory, the scientists (who
are now treated as heretics and have been banned) describe a 23 point assembly
that occurs when one "couples" the AIDS virus with VISNA. This would appear
to confirm the close genetic origins of these two viruses; they conclude
their argument by illustrating that the part of the human virus (HTLV-1)
grafted onto VISNA (previously non-virulent for humans), is precisely the
part of the genetic code (DNA) which programmes the production of a protein
permitting the attachment of HTLV-1 onto human T-4 lymphocytes. According
to this theory, as soon as the protein was attached, VISNA became virulent
to the cells and thus to humans!
<p>This theory has since been denounced as propaganda orchestrated by counter-espionage
from what was the USSR. Gorbatchov even made an official apology. Is this
a manoeuvre to cloud the issue or are these real capitalist contradictions?
Today, Professor Gallo himself, the number 1 of AIDS research, has been
denounced by the American police for having concealed details of his discovery
of the AIDS virus. Will Clinton also apologize?

the State has used AIDS to reinforce its anti-pleasure drive. AIDS is presented
as a penitence and Morality has never been so powerful in imposing Family,
Tradition, Abstinence, Sacrifice, Marriage and Chastity as guardians of
Order in this world.

<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">Introduction</font></u></h2>
We have chosen to present here a text, called "The Beast of Property",
written by Johann Most in 1883, for different reasons: first of all, we
want to break with a myth: the myth claiming that no revolutionary organization
existed outside and against Social Democracy before 1914. Indeed, all those
who never accepted that Social Democracy (considered here as the whole
of the parties organized in and around the Second International) (1) was
counterrevolutionary from its birth, created a myth, a myth claiming that
before the fateful date of 1914 Social Democracy was a revolutionary organization
defending the interests of the proletariat. This meant that, according
to Social Democracy, any attempt to organize outside and against itself,
was condemned to political death and/or sectarianism. We completely disagree
with this position. Without going into details, it is important to mention
that Social Democracy was engendered by the counterrevolution that followed
the defeat of the Paris Commune and more generally the defeat of the whole
proletarian movement of that period. Ideologizing the revolutionary program
elaborated by Marx and Engels, emptying it of its necrological content
(2) to keep only its envelop, its form, its words, Social Democracy created
"marxism" (i.e. an attempt to give a new look to the same old theories
of political economy that Marx criticized) and by that, a fictitious filiation
with the First International of which it took the name: Second International;
Social Democracy, the party of Capital for the workers, became a major
force of attraction for the proletariat which was then framed and disciplined
in order to participate in the good functioning of the system. How did
Social Democracy do that? It disintegrated the proletariat into a mere
economic category: the workers, reducing the proletariat to "those who
work", no matter if they fight against work or not, annihilating any attempt
at struggling. On the other hand, Social Democracy aimed to organize the
whole life of these workers: it created trade unions, schools, universities,
cultural groups, choral groups, etc., so as to control every minute of
the workers' life and be able to channel every fit of anger into a claim
for "better living conditions", the aim of which was to make exploitation
acceptable to the exploited.
<p>In Germany the strength of the Social Democratic Party was immense,
but many militants tried to organize against it. "Die Jungen" ('The Young')
are one of the most interesting oppositions, because, from 1889 to 1891,
the date of their expulsion from the SDP, this group, in its fight against
reformism and parliamentarism, claimed Marx's revolutionary program and
rejected what Social Democracy had made of it. Other oppositions fought
against the counterrevolutionary nature of an organization that spoke out
in the name of the revolution but defended reformism, parliamentarism,
gradualism and pacifism; but very few of them were able to reappropriate
the bases of the revolutionary program elaborated by Marx, very few militants
recognized the difference between Marx and "marxism" (in the sense of the
ideologization of Marx's criticism), and many negated the programmatical
importance of the former in their struggle against the latter. This weakness
led the militants breaking with the SDP to the anarchist ideology... Indeed,
to briefly sum up this quite complex process, let's say that the leadership
of the opposition to Social Democracy was, in most cases, confiscated by
the anarchist ideology. The story of "Die Jungen" is a good example of
this process. After their exclusion from the SDP, "Die Jungen" created
the "Gathering of the Inde pendent Socialists" that united two divergent
tendencies: the first one opposing the counterrevolutionary and parliamentarist
character of the SDP, the second one opposing the exclusions and the dictatorship
of the SDP as well as the "compulsory centralisation that comes with it".
Up until 1893, "Der Sozialist", the journal of the newborn organization,
will be the centre of polemics between the two tendencies. From 1893, and
in spite of the so-called Oppositional tendency, Gustav Landauer takes
the leadership of the journal. The Oppositional tendency quits. Some of
its militants will go back to the SDP, the others will stop all activities.
What is left of "Die Jungen" and "Der Sozialist", under Landauer's influence
will turn to the social democratic version of anarchism: educationism (to
educate each proletarian before taking mass actions), self-management (to
form little communities producing in accordance with their needs) and pacifism
(against violence and direct action). Landauer stands for "a real democracy"
and rejects the dictatorship of the proletariat ("<i>Would it be a threat...
I would hate it and fight against it as if it was the plague</i>" he said).
In January 1919 (!!) Landauer goes back to the parliament (to propagate
his ideas and "<i>fight without concession</i>" the parliamentary system).
He will be assassinated in May 1919, his work done: the breaking of "Die
Jungen" has come back to the bosom of the German Social Democratic Party.
<p>In this short paragraph we wanted to recall the role of Social Democracy
and the necessity to break the myth created about it. It is in this sense
that we consider "The Beast of Property" as being interesting and important.
This text belongs to the whole of the attempts made to break with Social
Democracy, that is the first reason why we publish it.

<h2>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">oOo</font></h2></center>
The second reason why we present this text is that it is representative
of the period in which it was written. It really is an expression of the
struggles of its epoch, as well as the memory of the attempts of revolutionary
militants who undertook the direction of the struggles against Social Democracy.
<p>The text we present here was written in the United States in 1883 by
an ex-MP of the SDP: Johann Most. The trajectory of this militant is interesting
inasmuch as it is representative of the trajectory of many of his comrades
and, in general, of many militants all over the world in their fight against
Social Democracy.
<p>Born in 1846 in Germany, Johann Most joined in 1867 the Zurich section
of the International Working-Men's Association (First International). From
1869 until 1870, he lived in Austria, in Vienna (where he was three times
sent to jail because of his militant activities). In 1871, he was expelled
from that country and he went back to Germany where he edited social democratic
newspapers. In 1874, he was elected to the Reichstag. This experience led
him to break with the SDP. Indeed, instead of finding a place where he
could defend Socialism and the interest of the working class, he discovered
what he called later "<i>a theatre of marionettes</i>", being silenced
each time when the defence of the working class was at stake. Most had
thought that the parliament could be used as a tribune for the revolution.
He quickly experienced that it was only a show. Many other militants underwent
the same experience, from Karl Liebknecht to Domela Nieuwenhuis and Otto
R&uuml;hle, who broke with parliamentarism at different periods but on
the same basis. In 1878, Most was re- elected to the Reichstag, but the
same year, he broke with the party and, at the same time, with parliamentarism.
<p>1878 is the year when socialist activities were banned by the Bismarck
government. In fact, these anti-socialist laws (they were called 'Exceptional
Laws') did not prevent the SDP from taking part in the Reichstag, far from
it. These were laws against militant activities, that is to say against
the militant press, against propaganda, meetings, demonstrations... Therefore
all these activities had to be done illegally, and the SDP refused to organize
them, arguing that the party was safe and should organize legally. Social
Democracy used the anti-socialist laws to clean its own organization, to
get rid of the "trouble- makers" and to impose, even more strongly, reformism
and pacifism as the program on the workers. These anti-socialist laws were
introduced against the last revolutionary militants of the SDP. The party
justified its refusal to organize illegally by arguing that it was a necessity
to defend the acquisitions of the organization (schools, seats in parliament,
trade-unions,...), arguing that it was a necessity to defend the achievements
of the workers saying that there was a danger of losing them in confron
tations with the State. The same arguments were used by the same party
later, to justify the vote for the war credits in 1914.
<p>For a lot of militants this was the last straw. Johann Most is one of
them. Expelled from Berlin, he went to London where he published the first
issue of "Freiheit" ("Freedom"), a journal he will publish until he dies
in 1906. The SDP of Germany officially expelled him in 1880 at the Congress
of Wyden, arguing that Most had anti-organisational attitudes and a bad
character.
<p>In 1881, the International Social Revolutionary Congress of London took
place thanks to Most's and other European militants' initiative. These
militants' aim was to re-establish a true revolutionary International.
Johann Most could not attend the Congress for he was in jail because of
an article applauding the assassination of Alexander II.
<p>The Congress took the name of the "First International" but it refused
any central committee or executive bureau, since no central authority was
accepted except for a bureau of information. We can see the weakness of
this refusal to organize around a direction, around leaders, whatever name
they take, central committee, executive organ,... Because, for sure, a
direction will exist anyway and if it is not the revolutionary one, it
will be the one of the bourgeoisie, of democracy. The militants will learn
it through their own experience and will draw the lessons. On the other
hand, while this weakness is pres ent in many attempts to gather militant
forces, while this refusal of any kind of leadership is clearly written
in the programs of these organizations, it is visible that the practice
of the same militants is quite different, as we will see later. The threat
that this so called Black International posed, in the eyes of the bourgeoisie,
never became a reality. In Europe, it died soon, but in the United States
it had sequel as we will see later.
<p>As we have said, while staying in London, Most published the first issues
of "Freiheit". By 1880, the journal pushed revol utionary con spiracy in
the Blanquist sense of the term (that is to say the organ ization of clandestine
struc tures prepared to attack the State at its strategical points in order
to seize power) and propaganda by the deed. If it is clear to us that the
need for direct action, for proletarian violent actions against the bourgeoisie
and its State, as well as the need to organize illegally are essential
features of the revolutionary process; nevertheless, we must make it clear
that the proletarian insurrection, the communist revolution is something
completely different from an isolated conspiracy. If it is very important
for the revolutionary militants to be aware of the necessity of direct
action and conspiracy in order to seize power, it is at the same time as
important to be able to evaluate the period and the balance of forces between
the classes to avoid the trap of the Blanquist ideology (3) claiming that
the revolution could be achieved by an isolated coup.
<p>"Freiheit" called for the violent destruction of capitalism, denouncing
all partial reforms as mere betrayals; the lesson Johann Most drew of his
experience as deputy will lead the struggle of all his life. Most said
one day:
<blockquote><i>"that the end is to be made to the mockery of the ballot,
and that the best thing one can do with such fellows as Jay Gould and Vanderbilt
[american railway magnates] is to hang them on the nearest lamp-post."</i></blockquote>
Most urged the working class: if it did not crush their oppressors, the
oppressors would crush them, they would
<blockquote><i>"drown the revolution in the blood of the best and rivet
the chains of slavery more firmly than ever. Kill or be killed is the alternative."</i></blockquote>
And he added,
<blockquote><i>"We are revolutionists not from the love of gore, but because
there is no other way to free and redeem man kind. History has taught that.
No use of trying reform. The Gordian knot can be cut only by the sword,
and within a ew years the masses will write the history of the world."</i></blockquote>
It was indeed very clear to Johann Most that the only alternative to the
barbarity of this society was the social revolution and he was convinced
of the necessity to organize and arm in order to overthrow and defeat Capital.
<p>In 1882, facing very strong repression in England, Most answers positively
to J.H. Schwab's invitation and left London for Chica go.
<p>When he arrives in the USA, it is the time of a deep and hard crisis:
unemployment, misery, homelessness and starvation. In Chicago alone almost
34,000 workers were thrown out of work. Unemployment, added to the awful
living conditions, housing, ... led to social unrest, spontaneous upsurge,
demonstrations, boycotts. Strike after strike, the proletarians had to
face the local police and vigilantes, the National Guard units, the state
militias, the Pinkerton agents,... Bosses made blacklists and lockouts
whenever they needed them and the federal troops were always there to protect
them.
<p>As to political organizations, Social Democracy represented by the Socialist
Labor Party of the USA endured, around the end of the '70s, lots of divisions
and disagreements especially concerning two questions: the question of
self-defence and the question of political compromise. Some militants of
the SLP, as early as 1875, founded the "Lehr-und-Wehr Verein" ('Education
and Defense Society') in order to never again be beaten by the police or
the militia without fighting back (4). Under various names, these groups
of self-defence drilled with rifles and bayonets. Their purpose was to
protect mass meetings, demonstrations or any kind of proletarian gathering
from the brutality of the State guards. In 1878, the year of the anti-socialist
laws in Germany (that is to say the year the SDP purged its ranks), the
National Executive Committee of the SLP banned any armed organization and
ordered its members to withdraw. One more confirmation of the aim of Social
Democracy: to disarm the proletariat and to clean its own ranks from any
practice of direct action against the State. The National Executive Committee
dissociated itself from any armed organization "<i>that tries to accomplish
by force what could be obtained through ballot</i>". In 1879, the State
of Illinois proclaimed a new law forbidding all "<i>groups of men wearing
weapons without licence</i>" that "<i>associate as military company or
instruct or file past, wearing arms, in whatever city, without the government's
permission</i>". The "Lehr-und-Wehr Verein" and other similar structures
it engendered (such as the "Bohemian Sharpshooters", the "Jaeger Verein",
the "Irish Guards",...) went underground. Moreover, the SLP proposed to
unify with the Greenback-Labor Party (a liberal party) to be stronger for
the presidential elections of 1880. But an "anti-compromise" opposition
was born that was very virulent in favouring self- defence organizations
and refusing any kind of alliance with what they called a reformist party.
A little later, during the elec tions, electoral officials falsified the
election results in Chicago to prevent the victory of a SLP member and
even though he eventually got his mandate, it was the last straw convincing
many militants to break with the SLP and turn to direct action. Amongst
these militants two currents could be seen: one preaching trade union work
and fighting for direct economic gains, the other willing to abandon political
and economic reforms in favour of revolutionary action. Nevertheless, together
they created in November 1880 a new organization in New York: the "Socialist
Revolutionary Club", whose most famous members were Parsons, Spies, Schwab,
Grottkau and Neebe (5), led by Wilhelm Hasselmann, an ex-member of the
SDP of Germany, which had expelled him together with Johann Most in 1880.
<p>The militants claiming that revolutionary action was urgent and should
begin right now no longer believed that ballots could change the system.
They urged direct action and armed struggle against the State, the Parliament
and reforms. And that's what they called on proletarians to do: the direct
and final confrontation with Capital. One of Parsons' phrases expresses
at the same time the force and the limit of the militants in that period
as far as the necessity to overthrow the State is con cerned. Parsons said:
<blockquote><i>"The State in every form is nothing else than an organized
conspiracy of the propertied class to deprive the working-class of their
natural rights."</i></blockquote>
We do agree with this quotation. But we would like to add that by "natural
rights" we mean, just like Parsons does, the natural needs that human beings
feel as soon as they are born: the need of human community, love, food,
shelter and the need of reproduction of his species. These are the "natural
rights" of human beings. Of course, there is an easy confusion that can
be made, and that is being made and maintained by Democracy. Indeed, Democracy
is the reign of the citizen, that is to say, the total negation of the
existing classes (and therefore of the antagonism between these two classes).
The citizen has many rights as long as he behaves as a good citizen, i.e.
as long as he defends Democracy. But those rights we are talking about
now (constitutional rights, right of vote, liberty, equality, fraternity,...
in short the rights and duties of any good citizen who loves his country
and is ready to die for it) are only the recuperation and the deviation
of so called "natural rights". Let us mention that as soon as the citizen
behaves like a proletarian, as soon as he defends his interest against
exploitation, rights cease to exist. No right is granted to the working-class
when it acts as a class. Rights are only granted to citizens. Repressive
terror for all those who do not behave as good citizens is a logical response
to the bourgeois ideal of democratic paradise (6).
<p>As we have said, the International Social Revolutionary Congress of
London died very soon after it was founded, but it had consequences in
the USA: on 21st, 22nd and 23rd October, 1881, on the initiative of the
New York Social Revolutionary Club, the first attempt to centralize the
revolutionary socialists on a national scale took place. The Congress took
the name of "Congress of Socialists of the United States". Schwab, Parsons
and Spies played the leading role. The Congress condemned the British government
for the repression in Ireland, expressed its support to the "populists"
in Russia for their "unrelenting warfare" against the tsar, it denounced
private property and "wage slavery", endorsed the decisions of London,
and declared it was in favour of "armed organizations of workingmen who
stand still to resist, gun in hand". Nevertheless, a compromise had to
be made between those saying that parliament could be a useful means of
agitation and those claiming that nothing could ever be obtained through
the ballot. The compromise which was adopted let each group decide for
itself whether to engage in parliamentary activity or not. Once more, we
can discern, in the formal program of the Congress, the many confusions
and weaknesses that reflected the more general lack of a breaking with
Social Democracy. Indeed the support for the "populists in Russia", the
endorsement of the decision of London on the question of organisation,...
<p>The Congress founded the "Revolutionary Socialist Party", a very contradictory
organization to which Most tried later to give a clearer direction, and
which defined itself as a branch of the IWMA recently revived in London.
Like the former, it was a network of groups all over the country, linked
together through the Information Bureau centred in Chicago. This organization
remained inactive and virtually dormant until the arrival of Johann Most,
who managed to close ranks (7).
<p>Most's life is a permanent attempt to organize revolutionaries, to give
a direction to the movement, to centralize activities outside and against
Social Democracy. He made tour all over America and held meetings, demos,
picnics, etc., in which he defended the need to organize or invited SLP
members to argue with them in front of the crowd. In each city where he
held meetings and speeches calling the proletarians to organize, new groups
sprang up. His aim was to gather the different socialist currents, to gather
under the same flag all those who fought for the revolution. It was in
the same perspective that Johann Most called for a unification congress
of all the new-born groups and the already existing associations. This
congress was to take place in Pittsburgh in 1883.
<p>J. Most, Spies, Drury, Parsons, etc. drafted the charter of this Congress,
this charter remained in history as "The Pittsburgh Manifesto", also known
as the "Pittsburgh Proclamation", and became the charter of revolutionary
militants in that period. The Manifesto opened as follow:
<blockquote><i>"Fellow Workmen: - The Declaration of Independence says:</i>
<blockquote><i>'But when a long train of abuses and usurpa tions, pursuing
invariably the same object, evinces a design to reduce them [the people]
under absolute Despotism, <b>it is their right, it is their duty</b>, to
throw off such government, and to provide new guards for their future security'.</i></blockquote>
<i>This thought of Thomas Jefferson was the justification for armed resistance
by our forefathers, which gave birth to our Republic, and do not necessities
of the present time compel us to re-assert their declaration?"</i></blockquote>
Was the government anything but an oppressor, "a conspiracy of the ruling
classes" against the people? demanded the Proclamation. It went on denouncing
the capitalist system as "unjust, insane and murderous", condemning the
State, the church and the educational system as instruments of "class domination".
Time had come "<i>to totally destroy it with and by all means</i>", it
declared. Rejecting political reforms because the ruling class would never
surrender without fighting, it defended the position that <i>"the struggle
of the proletariat with the bourgeoisie must have a violent revolutionary
character"</i>. <i>"So"</i>, the Manifesto continued, <i>"we must agitate
for the purpose of organization; organization for the purpose of rebellion"</i>.
<p>The Manifesto ended as follows:
<blockquote><i>"The day has come for solidarity. Join ranks! Let the drum
beat defiantly the roll of battle: 'Workmen of all countries unite! You
have nothing to lose but your chains; you have a world to win!' Tremble,
oppressors of the world! Not far beyond your purblind sight there dawns
the scarlet and sable lights of the JUDGEMENT DAY!"</i></blockquote>
Besides this real attempt to centralize the militant forces of the country
and even the world, the program of the Manifesto carries some reformist
demands. First of all when it reproduces part of the Declaration of Independence
of the United States, moreover, then when it claims for the improvement
of the capitalist system through a better respect of the rights and duties,
etc. These weaknesses are in fact the weaknesses of that period. Indeed,
almost throughout the whole world, militants believe it is still possible
to change the system thanks to the strict application of the Constitution.
They think its strict application would wipe-out forever the injustices
of this world. They demand equal rights for all and call for the overthrowing
of a government that wouldn't respect the Constitution,... Doing so, they
are in contradiction with their previous affirmations that defined any
government as a conspiracy of the ruling class. The "Manifesto" also contained
important theoretical weaknesses as far as the way of organizing was concerned.
It proposed a federation of organizations of producers linked by free contracts,
without commerce or profit-mongery, etc.
<p>To better understand the internal contradiction and the lack of a break
of the revolutionary organisations of that period with Social Democracy,
it is important to keep in mind the fact that very few militants were acquainted
with the polemics between Marx and Lassalle, knew about Marx's programmatical
developments and analysis. Their terrain was the terrain of agitation,
speeches, meetings, etc.; they did not deal with the programmatical analysis
of the capitalist system, its way of functioning. This lack of comprehension
had repercussions on the propositions they made for the future society,
and even limited their own struggle. Nevertheless, the federative way of
organization declared in the platform of the Pittsburgh Manifesto was denied
later by the centralized way in which the different groups that composed
the new organization centralized their activities. For the militants who
attended the congress, the federative way of organization was considered
as an alternative to social democratic centralism; it represented a guarantee
against everything they had to confront in the social democratic parties,
that is to say bureaucratism, authoritarism, blind submission, parliamentarism...
Federalism is seen as a guarantee against and a response to democratic
centralism of social democracy and not (which it really is) as the other
side of the same coin that is the democratic way of organization. In the
federative way of organization bureaucrats are replaced by elected and
revocable delegates (who become soon bureaucrats as well); authoritarism
is replaced by anti- authoritarism, which, claiming the refusal of any
leadership, allows the society to give its own direction; parliamentarism
is replaced by assembleism, which has the same basis: the law of the majority
and/or the delegation that deprives the proletariat of the possibilities
to decide and act giving that the latter are delegated to the so-called
"higher" spheres.
<p>The Pittsburgh Congress gathered the delegates of 26 cities, nearly
twice as many as the Chicago Congress. And the Pittsburgh Manifesto was
issued at the same time in English, German, French, Czech, Spanish and
Yiddish.
<p>The Congress proclaimed the death of the Revolutionary Socialist and
called itself the "International Working People's Association" because
it considered itself as the true successor of the First International contrary
to the Second International and in opposition to the latter. And the IWPA
really was the heir of the First International, even if this attempt was
not, con trary to its predecessor, the expression of an international movement
of centralization of class struggle. Indeed, the IWPA was created in a
period that we cannot consider as a period of world revolutionary struggles
and in this sense it may be considered as a voluntarist attempt. But, one
cannot forget that the United States were shaken by a real revolutionary
movement to which it tried to give centralization and direction. Therefore,
it responded to a real need: the need to centralize struggles and militants
and to give them a revolutionary direction.
<p>From 1883 to 1886 the groups of the IWPA multiplied. From 2,000 in 1883
it climbed to 5,000 by the end of 1885 with perhaps three times as many
supporters and sympathizers. Chicago remained the centre of the IWPA, which
is not by chance. Indeed, Chicago was not only a pole of highly concentrated
capital (mines, railways, car factories,...) due to its geographical situation
(lake Michigan), but also the place where the class antagonisms were the
most obvious, where the police brutality was the most notorious and the
economic crisis the most cruel. Chicago had a long tradition of class struggle,
but, dramatically, there was a lack of the experience of previous militants'
nucleus, a lack of lessons drawn from the previous waves of struggle.
<p>Besides the economic crisis, the acceleration of the mechanization of
labour and the intensification of the division of labour changed the management
of society. The machinery and the division of labour provoked more sackings
and the situation worsened. In 1884, the average cuts amounted to 15 percent
and the year after even more, arousing waves of discontent.
<p>In this climate, the IWPA issued pamphlets, leaflets, journals, held
meetings, demonstrations, lectures, discussions,... denouncing the capitalist
system, the condition of wage-slavery, appealing the workers to wake up
and fight against the misery they were living in, to fight for another
society. Agitating "the Red Flag of the Commune", their placards said <i>"No
Quarter"</i>, <i>"Down with governments, god and gold"</i>, <i>"Exploitation
is legalized theft"</i>, <i>"Workingmen of the world, unite!"</i>. The
content of the slogans of the IWPA shows the clear will to destroy the
system, contrarily to the slogans of Social Democratic parties that claim
the pacific conquest of the State, ballots and elections,... The IWPA (contrarily
to the other organisations of the period such as the Knights of Labor,
the Unions, the SLP or later the ALF) proposed to organize not only the
proletarians working in the mines or in the factories, but also the unemployed,
the "unwanted" , the tramps, and others rejected with disdain by reformist
organizations. To all the discontented, the IWPA proposed to organize and
fight against the misery of this world and those responsible for it.
<p>During those years of crisis, many strikes broke out, nearly all for
better wages and (unfortunately often with reformist slogans claiming "the
right" to organize) against the repression of proletarian organization.
Each time, the State militia opened fire on the strikers and the bosses
answered by lockouts, blacklists, strikebreakers, etc. Apart from its work
to organize and unite the working-class, the IWPA organized armed sections
in many cities. These armed sections, following the model given by the
"Lehr-und-Wehr Verein", drilled and instructed their members in procuring
arms (guns, knives,...), in using them, in making bombs and grenades, etc.
Their purpose was the <i>"arming of the proletariat and the application
of the latest discoveries of science, especially chemistry"</i>, that is
to say, they were deter mined to take an eye for an eye (8). These calls
of the IWPA are not to be understood as all the pacifists (intentionally
or unintentionally) misinterpret them (as being calls to light class struggle
thanks to throwing bombs), but as they are: a real comprehension of the
terrorist nature of Capital and of the framework in which struggle against
Capital is imposed on us. As Parsons said in a speech about dynamite:
<blockquote><i>"...It is the peace-maker; it is man's best friend; it emancipates
the world from the domineering of the few over the many, <u>because all
government, in the last resort, is violence; all law, in the last resort,
is force</u>."</i> (our emphasis)</blockquote>
If it is clear for us that dynamite in itself does not emancipate the world,
that is has no emancipating virtue in itself, and that it all depends on
the hand that throws it, we nevertheless want to stress the fact that at
that period all around the world revolutionaries considered dynamite as
the weapon par excellence. If we look back at the historical context we
can see that dynamite was almost only used by the proletariat, the bourgeoisie
preferred using guns and riffles... With this quotation we wanted to insist
on the one hand on the militant comprehension of the nature of all governments
and laws, and on the other hand, on the militant comprehension of the necessity
to use violent means against bourgeois terror.
<p>The revolutionary militants were convinced that the revolution was around
the corner and did whatever they could to be sure this time would be the
right time. In the USA, class struggle was so sharp and the climate was
so tense that it aroused a deep fear within the bourgeoisie. Its press
began to talk of "a new Paris Commune". A huge propaganda effort was launched
against the IWPA and its members, who were accused of being assassins,
arsonists, bombthrowers, devils,... The fear of the bourgeoisie gives an
idea of the strength of the proletarian movement. Revolutionary militants
in the USA tried to organize the proletarians struggling against the misery
of their living conditions.
<p>In this sense, it seems important to mention that a lot of proletarians
arrived in the USA attracted by a myth created in Europe: the myth of "the
land of promises", the country of political freedom and work for all, etc.
Parsons said in February 1884, when someone told him that America was superior
to other countries:
<blockquote><i>"America is not a free country. The economic condi tions
of the workers are the same as they are in Europe. A wage slave is a <u>slave</u>
everywhere, without any regard to the country he may happen to have been
born in or may be living in."</i></blockquote>
He added that the workers had no other choice but organize and rebel or
remain slaves. We can find exactly the same idea in "The Beast of Property"
when Most says:
<blockquote><i>"Indeed it seems as though this young American republic
had for the present but one historical mission, of demonstrating beyond
controversy to the people on this side of the Atlantic as to those of the
other by the presentation of bare, tangible facts what an outrageous monster
the 'beast of property' really is, and that <u>neither the condition of
the soil nor the vastness of domain, nor the political forms of society
can ever alter the viciousness of this beast of prey...</u>"</i> (our emphasis)</blockquote>
In "The Beast of Property", written in the year of the Pittsburgh Congress,
the strongest part lies in its denunciation of reformism. First of all
the denunciation of "parliamentary windbags", as well as petitions, elections
and laws; the denunciation of those who mystify the Economy, all the teachers
of political economy, "lackeys of the bourgeoisie", "those charlatans"
who try to hide the revolutionary character of the proletariat behind a
fairer distribution of richness. Most also denounces, against the current,
those Socialists who claim the pacifist and gradual conquest of the power
by intellectuals and scientists who will plan everything and more specifically
the economy. In other words, the text spits on what Social Democracy praises,
on what Social Democracy claims to belong to. "The Beast of Property" claims
that the present system is worse than the previous ones: <i>"But the climax
of infamy has been reached by our present 'law and order' system..."</i>.
Against these same specialists, these teachers of economy who claim this
society as being the society of the welfare of humanity, Most affirms that
this system is worse than the previous ones. It engenders progress indeed,
into more barbarity, more capitalism, that is to say that the capitalist
progress is reactionary as far as communism is concerned. Educationism
and the enlightenment of the masses, cornerstones of the Social Democratic
programme, are also denounced and criticised when the text says:
<blockquote><i>"Some say, general education will bring about a change;
but this advise is as a rule and idle phrase. Education of the people will
only then be possible when the obstructions there to have been removed.
And that will not take place until the entire present system has been destroyed."</i></blockquote>
The only solution, says Most, is revolution, the communist destruction
of this world, and a <i>"society (...) organised on a communistic basis"</i>,
<i>"everything
is ripe for Communism"</i>, the text says, and Johann Most does not avoid
the most central point; the point that shows his permanent attempts to
organize the proletarian struggles outside and against Social Democracy
(and this confirms his practical struggle for the centralization of revolutionary
forces, negating his own claim for federative based structures): the necessity
of a <i>"well trained revolutionary nucleus"</i>. That is to say the necessity
of a revolutionary leadership! On this point, Johann Most joins all the
revolutionary militants who insisted on the necessity to organize around
the highest level of rupture, around a revolutionary vanguard.
<p>The first part of the text, focusing on economy, is in fact quite confused
and even sometimes wrong. This is due to the fact that Social Democracy
used "marxism" as a bible to justify its defense of the system, therefore
revolutionary militants (unable to differentiate between Marx and "marxism")
refused to reappropriate Marx's criticisms of society. This led to the
situation that the number of militants who had notions of the way the capitalist
system functions were very few. This part of the text is an attempt to
vulgarize "Capital". A previous attempt of this kind had already been strongly
criticised by Marx when Most tried to rewrite "Capital" so as to be understood
by everyone. First of all, Marx's Capital was written to be read by proletarians
in an organized framework; secondly, Marx also treated the question at
another level of abstraction in "Wage labour and Capital" and "Wage, price
and profit". These books are excellent examples of the possibility of saying
the same thing at different levels of abstraction without betraying the
common content. When J. Most tried to write a new version of "Capital",
accessible to everyone, he changed the content of the book, its essence,
which led him to falsify Marx's positions.
<p>Some will say other weak points exist in this text, and we will not
deny it. We are well aware of the weaknesses and the limits of this text,
we clearly see that they are due not only to the period but also to the
weakness of the rupture with Social Democracy in the historical sense of
the term. Nevertheless, the interest of the text exists and lays less in
what it says than in what it reveals as an attempt to fight practically
against the monopoly Social Democracy claims to hold as far as the organization
(we would rather say disorganization) of the proletariat is concerned.
Moreover, this text is also a witness of the class struggle movement in
the USA. We intend to carry on studying the history of our class struggle
in that part of the world and call on our readers to help us by sending
criticisms, information, texts,...
<h3>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">Notes</font></u></h3>
1. Nevertheless, Social Democracy is not only the formal parties organized
in and around the Second International; it has a much larger dimension:
the concept of Social Democracy, in its full meaning, refers to the historical
party of the counterrevolution, that is to say that it refers to the framework
in which Capital enrols the workers on behalf of "socialism".
<p>2. Here we talk about the necrological content of the analysis made
by revolutionaries. By "necrological content" we mean the intrinsically
catastrophical essence of Capitalism. Indeed, Capitalism, as everything
else, carries in itself its own contradictions, its own gravediggers, its
own death; in this case the proletariat. It is what Marx develops in "Capital",
and it is what Social democracy (and more particularly, the "marxist" current,
very fond of political economy) tried hard to transform and recuperate.
And it is very logical: the aim of Social Democracy being the preservation,
the maintenance of this system, it cannot see in "Capital" anything else
but a <u>biology</u> of capitalist social relationships, an analysis of
their function ing. Of course this is totally coherent, since the Social
Democrat point of view is the improvement and the reform of this mode of
production. On the contrary, we, revolutionaries, have a totally antagonistic
view point and a totally antagonistic aim: we only care and fight for the
<u>destruction</u>
of this system; and it is also in this sense and from this point of view
that Marx wrote "Capital": a
<u>necrology</u> of capitalist social relationships.

de notre critique de l'Economie: Le marxisme en tant qu'&eacute;conomie
politique en opposition avec l'oeuvre de Marx"
<p>3. By "Blanquist ideology" we mean the ideology based on the weaknesses
of Blanqui's practice.
<p>4. The german name of this structure reveals the numerical importance,
in that period, of the immigration of militants coming from Germany.
<p>5. Parsons and Spies, are two of the militants that will be accused
of murder after the events of May 1886 at Haymarket. They will be hanged
on the 11 november 1887 as well as Engel and Fisher; Lingg will commit
suicide in jail, and Schwab and Fielden will be condemned to life imprisonment.
<blockquote>"<i>The day will come when our silence will be more powerful
than the voices you are throttling today</i>"</blockquote>
Spies' last words still echoes and it is to prevent them from fading away
that we publish this text. The day will come when our comrades' prophecy
will quell for ever the terror of the proletariat's torturers... we are
working in this perspective.
<p>6. For more details on this subject, see in this review
"Against the
Myth of Democratic Rights and Liberties".
<p>7. All the proletarian attempts to centralize and constitute themselves
as a force will take the structure of groups organised according to geographical
repartition and also according to the language of the participating militants.
Maybe the division of the United States into federated states is not alien
to this fact. Anyway, the bourgeoisie will use and abuse this weakness,
invoking american (sic) nationalism to divide the proletarians and design
the strangers (and more particularly the militants of German origin, the
more numerous at that moment) as being responsible for all evils.
<p>8. Militants of the IWPA call for the using of the progress of science.
J.Most in his book "Revolutionary War Science" writes:
<blockquote>"<i>To be sure of success, revolutionaries should always have
on hand adequate quantity of nitroglycerine, dynamite, hand grenade, and
blasting charges..."</i></blockquote>

<blockquote><i>"Proletarians of all country, arm yourselves! Arm yourselves
by whatever means you can. The hour of battle is near.</i>"</blockquote>
"The Alarm" and the "Die Arbeiter Zeitung" (two of the fourteen journals
of the IWPA) often publish articles such as "<i>The Manufacture of the
Dynamite Made Easy</i>" and "<i>Explosive: a Practical Lesson in Popular
Chemistry</i>". At that time, all throughout the world, the proletarians
use dynamite against their class enemy. Just remember Ravachol in France,
at the end of the 19s century, or a few years later, the Bande &agrave;
Bonnot, etc.

<center>
<h1>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">* <font size=+4>*</font> *</font></h1></center>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Among the beasts of prey, man is certainly
the worst." This expression, very commonly made nowadays, is only relatively
true. Not man as such, but man in connection with wealth is a beast of
prey. The richer a man, the greater his greed for more. We may call such
a monster the "beast of property". It now rules the world, makes mankind
miserable, and gains in cruelty and voracity with the progress of our so-called
"civilization". This monster we will in the following characterize and
recommend to extermination.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Look about you! In every so-called "civilized"
country there are among every 100 men about 95 more or less destitute and
about 5 money-bags.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">It is unnecessary to trace all the sneaking
ways by which the latter have gained their possessions. The fact that they
own <u>all</u>, while the others exist, or rather vegetate merely, admits
of no doubt, that these few have grown rich at the expense of the many.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Either by direct brute force, by cunning,
or by fraud, this horde has from time to time seized the soil with all
its wealth. The laws of inheritance and entail, and the changing of hands,
have lent a "venerable" color to this robbery, and consequently mystified
and erased the true character of such actions. For this reason, the "beast
of property" is not yet fully recognized, but is, on the contrary, worshipped
with a holy awe.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">And yet, all who do not belong to this class
are its victims. Every off-spring of a non-possessor (poor man) finds every
nook and corner of the earth occupied at his entrance into this world.
There is nothing which is "lordless". Without labor nothing is produced;
and in order to labor, there are required not only ability and will, but
also room to work, tools, raw materials and means of sustenance. The poor
man must, therefore, by force of necessity, apply to those who possess
these things in plenty. And, behold! the rich give him permission to continue
his existence. But in return for this he must divest himself of his skill
and power. These qualities henceforth his pretended "saviors" use for themselves.
They place him under the yoke of labor - they force him to the utmost of
his mental and physical abilities to produce new treasures, which however
he is not entitled to own. Should he desire to deliberate long before making
so unequal contract, his growling stomach will soon convince him that the
poor man has no time for that, for there are millions in the same position
as himself and he will risk that, while deliberating, hundreds of others
will apply - his chance is gone and he again will be at the mercy of the
winds.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">It is the lash of hunger which compels the
poor man to submit. In order to live he must sell -<u>"voluntarily" sell-
himself</u> every day and hour to the "beast of property".</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">The bygone times, when the "ruling" classes,
on their slave-hunting raids, threw their victims in chains and forced
them to work, of which the rulers had all the benefit - the times when
christian-germanic robbers stole entire countries, deprived the inhabitants
of the soil, and pressed them to feudal service, were indeed terrible enough.
But the climax of infamy has been reached by our present "law and order"
system, for it has defrauded more than nine-tenths of mankind of their
means of existence, reduced them to dependence upon an insignificant minority,
and condemned them to self-sacrifice. At the same time it has disguised
this relation with all sorts of jugglery that the thralls of today - the
wage slaves - but partially recognize their serfdom and outlawed position,
they rather incline to ascribe it to the caprices of fortune.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">To perpetuate this state of affairs is the
only aim of the "prominent" classes. Though not always united among themselves
- one seeking to gain advantage over the oother by tricks of trade, cunning
in speculation and diverse machinations of competition - yet in opposition
to the proletariat they stand in one united hostile phalanx. Their political
ideal is, therefore - in spite of all phrases - a most powerful, centralized
and brutal beadle government.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">If the poor man, who is momentarily unable
to sell himself to an exploiter of labor, or is already flayed to complete
helplessness by the "beast of property", has recourse to begging -then
the glutted bourgeois terms it vagrancy, and calls for police; he demands
pillory and prison for the poor devil who refuses to starve between mountains
of food.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Should the unemployed apply a little of the
much vaunted self-help, that is, should he do in a small way, what the
rich do daily with impunity on a grand scale, should he, in fact, steal,
in order to live - the bourgeoisie will heap burning coals of "moral indignation"
upon his head, and, with austere visage, hand him over relentlessly in
charge of the State, that in its prisons he may be fleeced the more effectively,
i.e., cheaper.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">When the workers combine in order to obtain
better wages, shorter hours of labor, or similar advantages, the money-bags
immediately decry it as "conspiracy", which must be prevented.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">When the workers organize politically, it
is denounced as resistance to the "divine" order of things, which must
be nullified by laws or exception or discrimination.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Should the people finally contemplate rebellion,
an unceasing howl of rage raised by the "gold tigers" will be heard throughout
the world - their pant for massacres and their thirst for blood is insatiable.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">The life of the poor man is valued as nothing
by the rich. As the owner of vessels he places the lives of entire crews
in jeopardy, when his object is to fraudulently obtain high insurance for
half decayed hulks. Bad ventilation, deep excavation, defective supports,
etc., etc., annually bring death to thousands of miners, but this system
of operation saves expenses, therefore augments the gains, and gives the
mine owners no occasion to be sorry. Neither does the factory-pasha care
how many of "his" laborers are tom and rent apart by machinery, poisoned
by chemicals, or slowly suffocated by dirt and dust. Profit is the main
thing.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Women are cheaper than men: for this reason
the capitalistic vampires with insatiate rapacity seek their blood. Besides,
female labor procures them cheap mistresses.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Child flesh is the cheapest: what wonder
then that the cannibals of modern society continually feast upon juvenile
victims? What care they that the poor little ones are thereby bodily crippled
and mentally ruined for life - that thousands of them, miserable and worn
out at a tender age, sink into their graves? Stocks rise; that suffices.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">As the bourgeoisie, by means of its capital,
completely monopolizes all new inventions, every new machine, instead of
shortening the hours of labor and enhancing the prosperity and happiness
of <u>all</u>, causes, on the contrary, dismissal from employment for some,
reduction of wages for others and an increased and intensified state of
misery for the entire proletariat.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">When increase of production is accompanied
by an augmented pauperization of the masses, consumption must simultaneously
decrease, stagnation and crises must ensue. A superabundance of actual
wealth in the hands of the few must create hunger, typhus, and other epidemics
among the many. The injustice - yea the idiocy - of this state of affairs
is evident. The money-bags of course merely shrug their shoulders. This
they will continue to do until a rope well tied <u>over</u> their shoulders
will end all further shrugging.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">The worker is not only fleeced in manifold
ways as producer, but also as consumer. Numberless parasites seek to despoil
him of his paltry income.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">After products have passed through various
exchanges and storage and their prices have been raised by jobbers and
brokers' profits, by taxes and custom house duties, they finally reach
the retailers, whose customers are almost exclusively the proletarians.
The wholesalers "make" (that is, fraudulently obtain) perhaps 10 to 20
per cent profit by their transactions; the retailer is dissatisfied with
less than 100 percent. . He makes use of all sorts of tricks for securing
this result, especially the most shameless adulteration of food. In close
relationship to these swindlers are the numberless poisoners and adulterators
of beer, liquors, wine, etc., who render the streets in all our great cities
and industrial centers unsafe with their nefarious traffic. Then there
are the tenement-lords, who ceaselessly seek means to embitter the existence
of the poor. The condition of the rooms becomes steadily worse, the rents
higher, and the contracts more galling. The workers are crowded together
more and more into rear houses, attics and cellar-holes full of vermin,
damp and musty. Prison cells are frequently far healthier than these pest-holes.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">When the worker is out of employment, he
is again at the mercy of a horde of speculators in hunger, who are ready
to pounce on him in order to complete his ruin. Pawnbrokers and others
of similar ilk advance small sums at high interest on the last possessions
of the poor. Their contracts are usually so arranged that they can hardly
be kept: the pawned objects are forfeited and the poor wretch takes another
downward step. The cut-throats, however, amass fortunes in a short time.
The beggar is looked upon as quite a well-paying figure by certain sharks.
Every copper which he has gathered in his unenviable way arouses the covetousness
of the keeper of dirty holes and vile dens. Even thieves are subject to
this capitalistic spoliation. They are the slaves of crafty concealers
and "fences", who receive their stolen goods for a song. Yes! even those
unfortunate women, whom the present accursed system has driven to prostitution,
are shamelessly plundered by keepers of brothels and "houses of ill-fame."</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">This is the lot of the poor from the cradle
to the grave. Whether he produces or consumes, whether he exists or merely
vegetates, he is always surrounded by ravenous vampires who thirst for
his last drop of blood. On the other hand, the rich man never stops his
work of exploiting, though he may be utterly unable to assign a reason
for his greed. He that has $1,000,000 would have $10,000,000; he that has
$100,000,000 would have $1,000,000,000.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">The greed for wealth is closely associated
with the greed for power. Wealth is not only a generator of more wealth,
it is also a political power. Under the present capitalistic system venality
is an all-pervading vice. It is as a rule a mere matter of price which
will buy over those who may be of service either by speech or silence,
by pen or by press, by acts of violence or any other means, to the "beast
of property" which by its golden dictates is the absolute, almighty divinity.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">In Europe and America there are several hundred
thousand priests and ministers, specially provided for to poison the common
sense of the masses. Numberless missionaries wander from house to house
spreading senseless tracts, or commit other "spiritual" mischief. In the
schools strenuous attempts are made to nullify what little good the training
in reading, writing, and ciphering may bring with it. Idiotic maltreatment
of "history" excites that blatant prejudice which divides people, and prevents
them from recognizing the fact, that their oppressors have long ago leagued
together against them, and that all politics, past and present, has the
only object in view of firmly establishing the power of the rulers, and
thereby ensuring exploitation of the poor by the rich.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">The hawking trade in "loyalty and order intoxicants"
is attended to by the inkslingers of the daily press, numerous literary
perverters of history, by political heelers of the various predominating
cliques, rings, combinations and organizations, by parliamentary windbags
with seductive smiles, pledges on their lips and treason in their hearts,
and hundreds of other politicians of all degrees and shades of villainy.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Whole squads of bushwackers are specially
employed in mystifying the social question. The professors of political
economy for instance, play the part of lackeys to the bourgeoisie, extolling
the golden calf as the true sun of life, and using falsehood and knavery
so "scientifically", that they make the tanning of workingmen's hides appear
as a benefaction to mankind. Some of those charlatans recommend social
reform, or in other words, processes, based on the maxim of washing without
wetting; not to mention their celebrated recipes for economizing and educating.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">While thus bamboozling the masses the capitalistic
knights of plunder continue to perfect their mechanism of power. New offices
are created. High positions in these are filled in Europe by the progeny
of the former highwaymen (now a "nobleman") in America by the most crafty
office hunters and the most wily thieves, who combine with their original
purpose of authoritatively gagging the proletariat, the very pleasant business
of till-tapping and forgery on a grand scale. They command armies of soldiers,
gendarmes, policemen, spies, judges, prison-keepers, toll-keepers, tax
collectors, executors, etc., etc. The lower class of the beadledom are
almost wholly recruited from the ranks of the non-possessors, and are only
rarely better paid. For all that they display great zeal as spies, eaves-droppers,
and pokenoses, as claws, teeth and suckers of the State, which institution
is evidently nothing more nor less than the political organization of a
horde of swindlers and spoliators, who without the tyrannizing machinery
could not exist for one day before the just wrath and condemnation of the
oppressed and plundered people.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">In most of the old countries this system
has naturally reached its points of culmination in the outer form. The
entire disciplinary apparatus of the State concentrates in a monarchic
power. Its representatives "by the grace of God" are, in accordance, the
very quintessence of villainy. In them all vice and crime common to the
ruling classes is developed to a monstrous degree. Their most agreeable
occupation is a wholesale murder (war); when they rob, and they do it often,
they always rob entire countries and hundreds, even thousands of millions.
Incendiarism on a colossal scale serves to illuminate their atrocities.
They adhere to the notion that mankind exists for them to kick, cuff, and
spit upon....</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">By direct blackmail these crowned murderers
of Europe annually pocket $50,000,000. Militarism, their pet progeny, annually
costs $1,000,000,000, not taking in consideration the loss of life and
labor. An equal sum is paid as interest on $20,000,000,000 of state-debts,
which these scoundrels have incurred in a comparatively short time. Monarchism
in Europe then cost annually $2,050,000,000 that is to say, more than 10,000,000
of workers, the supporters of 50,000,000 of people, earn as wages in the
same time.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">In America the place of the monarchs is filled
by the monopolists. Should monopolism in the alleged "free" United States
of America develop at the rate it has in the last quarter of century, there
will remain free from monopolization only daylight and air. Five hundred
million acres of land in the United States, about six times the area of
Great Britain and Ireland, have been divided within a generation among
the railroad companies and the great landlords of Europeo-aristocratic
origin. Within a few decades Vanderbilt alone amassed $200,000,000; several
dozen of his competitors in robbery bid fair to outdo him. San Francisco
was settled hardly thirty years ago, today it harbors eighty-five millionaires!
All the wealth of this great republic, although established but a century,
its mines, its coalfields, its oilwells, etc., etc., has been "taken" from
the people and is the property of a handful of daring adventurers and cunning
schemers.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">The "sovereignty of the people" falls prostrate
into the dust before the influence of these money kings, railroad magnates,
coal barons and factory lords. These fellows carry the whole Unites States
in their pockets, and that which is vaunted as untrammeled legislation
and free ballot is a farce, a delusion and a snare.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">If this be the condition of the green wood,
what may we not expect of the decayed timber? If this young American republic,
with its nearly boundless territory and its almost inexhaustible natural
resources has been so fatally corrupted and ruined in such a short time
by the capitalistic system - why be surprised at the results of long continued
abuses of similar nature in servile, rotten Europe?</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Indeed it seems as though this young American
republic had for the present but one historical mission, of demonstrating
beyond controversy to the people on this side of the Atlantic as to those
on the other by the presentation of bare, tangible facts what an outrageous
monster the "beast of property" really is, and that neither the condition
of the soil nor the vastness of domain, nor the political forms of society
can ever alter the viciousness of this beast of prey; but to the contrary,
it proves that the less a necessity naturally exists for individual greed
and rapacity, the more dangerous to, and obtrusive upon society it becomes.
It is not voracious to satisfy its wants - it devours for the sake of devouring
only!</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Let those who labor to live understand that
this monster cannot be tamed, nor be made harmless or useful to man; let
them learn to know that there is but one means of safety: unrelenting,
pitiless, thorough war of extermination! Gentle overtures are for naught;
scorn and derision will be the result, if by petitions, elections, and
like silly attempts the proletariat hopes to command the respect of its
sworn enemies.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Some say, general education will bring about
a change; but this advice is as a rule an idle phrase. Education of the
people will only then be possible, when the obstructions there to have
been removed. And that will not take place until the entire present system
has been destroyed.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">But let it not be understood that nothing
could or should be done by education. Far from it. Whoever has recognized
the villainy of the present conditions, is in duty bound to raise his voice,
in order to expose them, and thereby open the eyes of the people. Only
avoid to reach this result by super-scientific reflections. Let us leave
this to those well meaning scientists, who in this manner tear the mask
of humanity from the "better class" and disclose the hideous countenance
of the beast of prey. The language of and to the proletariat must be clear
and forcible.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoever thus uses speech will be accused
of inciting disturbance by the governing rabble; he will be bitterly hated
and persecuted. This shows that the only possible and practical enlightenment
must be of an inciting nature. Then let us incite!</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Let us show the people how it is swindled
out of its labor force by country and city capitalists; how it is euchered
out of its meagre wages by the house, store, and other lords; how priests
of pulpit, press, and party seek to destroy its intellect; how a brutal
police is ever ready to maltreat and tyrannize it, and with a soldiery
to spill its blood. Patience, at last must forsake it! The people will
rebel and crush its foes.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">The revolution of the proletariat - the war
of the poor against the rich, is the only way from oppression to deliverance.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">But, some interpose, revolutions can not
be made! Certainly not, but they can be prepared for by directing the people's
attention to the fact that such events are imminent, and calling upon them
to be ready for all emergencies.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Capitalistic development, of which many theorists
assert that it must proceed to the total extinction of the middle class
(small bourgeoisie), before the conditions favorable to a social revolution
are at hand, has reached such a point of perfection that its farther progress
is almost impossible. Universal production (in civilized countries) can
only be carried on, industrially as well as agriculturally, on a grand
scale, when society is organized on a Communistic basis, and when (which
will then be a truism) the reduction of the hours of labor keeps pace with
the development of technical facilities, and augmented consumption with
production.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">This is easily comprehended. By wholesale
production from 10 to 100 times more may be produced than the producers
need in goods of equivalent value, and there lies the rub. Until lately,
this entire surplus value has been but little noticed, because by far the
greater portion of this so-called profit has been in turn capitalized,
that is, used for new capitalistic enterprises, and because the industrially
most advanced countries (the "beast of property" in those countries) export
enormous quantities of merchandise. Now, however, the thing is beginning
to weaken mightily. Industrialism has made great progress the world over,
balancing exports and imports more and more, and for that reason new investments
of capital become less profitable, and must, under such circumstances,
soon prove entirely unremunerative. Universal crises must ensue and will
expose these glaring incongruities.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Everything therefore is ripe for Communism;
it is only necessary to remove its interested inveterate enemies, the capitalists
and their abettors. During these crises the people will become sufficiently
prepared for the struggle. Everything will then depend on the presence
of a well trained revolutionary nucleus at all points, which is fit and
able to crystallize around itself the masses of the people, driven to rebellion
by misery and want of work, and which can then apply the mighty forces
so formed to the destruction of all existing hostile institutions...</font>

<blockquote><font face="Comic Sans MS">"The working people thirst for the
truths of Socialism and welcome their utterance with shouts of delight.
It only lacks organisation and preparation, and the time for the social
revolt is at hand. Their miseries have become unendurable, and their necessities
will soon compel them to act, whether they are prepared or not. Let us
redouble our efforts and make ready for the inevitable. Let us strain every
nerve to awaken the people to the dangers of the coming storm between the
propertied and the propertyless classes of America. To this work let our
lives be devoted. Vive la r&eacute;volution sociale !"</font></blockquote>
