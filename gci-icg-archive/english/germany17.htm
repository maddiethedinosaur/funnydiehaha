<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">Introduction</font></u></h2>
Whatever the struggle of the world proletariat, considered in Russia, in
Germany or elsewhere, we will invariably get a vision about it -in its
more concrete expression in a place and in a given period of time- through
the world relation force between the enemy classes.
<p>The revolutionary convulsions, the movements of rupture that the proletariat
will show against the society of Capital, will produce vanguards (communist
hard cores) which will constitute transition expressions of the general
process of these movements. But these vanguards are, in fact, expressions
produced by the historic struggle of the proletariat, by its historic party,
that is to say by a much larger and more global movement (in time and space)
which overcomes them.
<p>This is why we don't start from the specific and particular history
of the various communist organizations or groups, but
<u>from the highest
moments of revolution and counterrevolution</u>, and in these moments,
<b><u>from
the clearest ruptures with counterrevolution, and from their organization
in force</u></b>.
<p>Facing each apprehension attempt of the historic movements, many myths
emerge which aim to explain the revolutionary defeats. These myths lean
on an anti-dialectic method, which sees lab assistants of history standing
above the movement and clinically analyzing the processes outside their
historic reality, to finally come to sanction the revolutionary confrontation
under form of platonic and "plekhanovian" decrees of deficiency: lack of
Party, lack of centralization, of internationalization,...
<p>To this incomprehension of the revolution, we oppose the dialectic materialism.
We understand history as a contradictory process of revolution and counterrevolution,
a process of confrontations, where the development of the centralizing
forces of a class pushes, forces and constrained the enemy class to surpass
itself in order to tempt to break the adversary, by its own organization
in force, by its own centralization (cf. our texts against the ideology
of courses). All historic analysis must start from the understanding of
the enemy forces.
<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">A. The process leading to the 1918-19 insurrectionary
attempt</font></u></h2>
1. The SPD, the trade-unions and more extensively, the whole of the left-wing
bourgeois forces, are determining in the terrorist throwing of the proletariat
into war, and in the imposition of social peace and national union. This
policy will provoke with the progression of the development of the struggles,
a process of rupture with the SPD. This one will then know a directional
crisis to which the bourgeoisie will answer by the emergence of left-wing
alternatives: the Spartakus League, the "community of work" (becoming later
the USPD).
<p>Revolution will express itself as for it, notably by the sudden appearance
(already before 1914) of a lot of lefts, and later by the constitution
of the ISD; it will also appear through a lot of attempts in order to organize
the struggle of the proletariat against war (Internationale Group, Pfemfert
and "Die Aktion", Borchardt and "Lichtstrahlen", the clandestine organization
of Reichpietsch's Soldiers and Sailors League...), as well as in the organization
of worker strikes and sabotages, through among others the Revolution&auml;re
Obleute ("Revolutionary Confidential Men", taken over later by the USPD).
<p>2. Mutinies break out to the front. The German army is subjected to
the running fire of the revolutionary defeatism, it is disorganized and
defeated.
<p>The bourgeoisie fears a fraternization with the proletarians in struggle
in the cities, and tries to organize the demobilization and the smoothly
return of the soldiers by researching some political alternative cards:
"it is necessary to prevent the disruption from down below by the revolution
from above", the military chiefs say, and they propose a government including
social-democrats.
<p>Sailors mutiny in Kiel. The proletariat, drawing the lessons of the
past, generalize the struggle and create councils to take and occupy the
cities (in Hamburg, one occupies war ships, harbours, trade-union houses,
barracks,...). One of the highest expressions of this arming process and
this will to widen the struggle is the creation, in Berlin, of a division
of revolutionary sailors: the Volksmarinedivision which, with the Red Soldiers
League, constitutes one of the most organized combative centres of the
proletariat.
<p>The proclamation of the Republic and the taking of control of the councils
by the SPD and the USPD, will constitute the answer of the bourgeoisie
to the proletarian assault against the State.
<p>Organized around the watch-word of dismissal of the imperial government
and proclamation of the Republic, the SPD and the USPD will quickly control
the councils. This seizure will be denounced by the communists who will
leave most of the councils, denouncing these as being the most adequate
form to destroy the struggle.
<p>3. The proletariat tempts to give a quality jump in the programmatical
and organizational rupture by the creation of the KPD and the reaffirmation
of incompatibility between parliamentarianism and destruction of the State,
between syndicalism and revolution.
<p>But the limit of this quality jump expresses itself by the existence,
by the side of the communists, of social-democrat forces gathered around
their spokeswoman, Rosa Luxemburg. She and her partisans will oppose the
revolutionary process of rupture with centrism within the KPD. A long time
opposed to the split with the USPD, Luxemburg, Liebknecht, Jogiches, Levi,...
will prevent the classist split within the KPD between on the one hand,
the communist hard cores working for the preparation of the revolution
and advocating to leave the trade-unions, and on the other hand, the centrists
recommending the electoral preparation and the collaboration with trade-unions.
<p>The communists will let these former social-democrat leaders occupy
the ruling positions of their organization.
<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">B. The insurrectionary tentative of 1918-19</font></u></h2>
4. The political crisis breaking out, two insurrectionary processes clash
and strengthen: one claiming the dictatorship of the proletariat and structuring
around the Volksmarinedivision, the other, launched by the USPD, aims to
the government overthrow.
<p>5. The clearest fractions of the bourgeoisie manage to understand the
role of the Volksmarinedivision and do everything possible to destroy it.
The Ebert's government provokes the sailors while suppressing their wages
and a military confrontation follows with divisions faithful to the power,
which will quickly be defeated by the massive involvement of the proletariat.
<p>Noske starts from this failure to take in hand the free corps formation
(corps specifically prepared against the insurrectionary struggle).
<p>6. January 5th, the proletariat rises up in Berlin, asking in the facts
for the question of insurrection. The USPD constitutes an insurrectionary
committee in order to tempt to reduce the confrontation of the proletariat
to the State, into a struggle against the government in place. Liebknecht
and the R.O. submit themselves to the instructions of this "insurrectionary"
committee, while the centrist forces are at work within the KPD, paralyzing
this one in the indecision and procrastination facing the counterrevolution.
<p>Luxemburg and the rest of the Berlin Central, mainly composed of former
social-democrat chiefs, are opposed to the insurrection, put forward the
"small revolutionary forces" and, facing thousands of proletarians in insurrection,
push so the party of revolution to turn into party of workers' democracy
and negotiation, throwing the door wide open to the reorganization of the
counterrevolution by its "bloody dogs".
<p>7. This policy allows Noske to bring in his free corps in Berlin and
to crush the struggles. Under way, he will continue on his strong-arm policy
of disarmaming the proletariat while assuming in whole Germany the repression
of the revolutionary movements, and this until the end of May 1919.
<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">C. From the Berlin massacre to the Ruhr insurrection</font></u></h2>
8. In spite of the massacres in Berlin and in whole Germany in 1919, the
SPD doesn't succeed in disarming the proletariat. The proletariat's answer
to the repression showed, indeed, a more clear-cut rupture towards the
SPD, the USPD, the trade-unions... It will materialize by a massive desertion
of these bourgeois organizations, by the creation of various workers' associations,
by a more marked centralization around its revolutionary program, by the
formal creation of classist centralization organs (Unions). The proletariat
is centred from then on around the KPD which manages to constitute a formal
hard core of reference of the rupture, that is to say a leadership. Within
the FAUD and the FVDG, a process of clarification also occurs, making emerge
more determined communist groupings.
<p>9. After the defeat of the struggles of 1919, the Levi's tendency, supported
by Radek and the Bolsheviks, follows in the continuation to Rosa Luxemburg,
Karl Liebknecht and Leo Jogiches, and leads the struggle against the communists
inside the KPD.
<p>This struggle aims to empty the program of the KPD of all revolutionary
substance, while diverting the antiparliamentarianism towards a question
of tactics, while eluding the syndical question around a problem of leadership
and while advocating a policy of entryism, while reducing the question
of the party at the level of the conception of any bourgeois political
party only able to answer to the call for an involvement to a workers'
government at a crucial moment of the struggle.
<p>At the second congress in Heidelberg, in October 1919, a takeover by
force endorses this program cleaning and practically expels all the KPD's
revolutionary elements, ending then the transformation of the "spartakist"
organization into a left social-democrat sect, now ready to fully align
itself with the Bolsheviks' policy.
<p>The communists are then reorganized through three tendencies:
<p>* a tendency crystallizes around Gorter who refuses this takeover by
force and calls for a conference of the party gathering all the tendencies
(the revolutionary communists (1) being extensively the majority) to conquer
so the party.
<p>* the tendency of Hamburg calls for the constitution of a new party
regrouping the left organizations; it puts forward the understanding of
the bourgeois role of luxemburgism and the USPD, but its defense of national-bolshevism
will discredit it and will bring it quickly in the camp of the counterrevolution.
<p>* the tendency organized around R&uuml;hle and Pfemfert in "Die Aktion"
which denounce the role of the KPD (Bankruptcy of the KPD).
<p>10. All these organizational modifications are only the reflection of
the proletariat's practical attempts to overthrow the State. The confrontation
with the State is thus going to carry out a clear demarcation line between
pacifism and direct action, between syndicalism and workers' associationism,
between parliamentarianism and dictatorship of the proletariat,..., leading
sometimes to the organizational rupture, sometimes to classist splits.
<p>Thus, various anarchist, revolutionary syndicalist, anarcho-syndicalist...
organizations, are also going to be submitted, in different senses, to
the upheaval of the communist movement.
<p>The FVDG comes from a rupture process with the social-democracy (ADGB).
Dissolved in 1914, -it was one of the only organizations to refuse the
war and the national union, it reconstituted since 1918. From November
1918 to May 1919, a big part of anarcho-syndicalists of the FVDG, regrouped
around Roche, will meet up by the sides of the revolutionary elements of
the KPD, in order to boycott the elections, to reject pacifism, to destroy
in acts the trade-unions and to theorize these actions as the expression
of the proletarian movement. Shortly after, Rocker and Kater, following
the crushing by Noske of the struggles in May 1919, will give a pacifist
orientation to the organization and will thus determine Roche to leave
the FVDG in order to come closer to Otto R&uuml;hle, with who he will later
constitute the AAUD-E.
<p>The FVDG will turn from then on into FAUD(S), created in 1919, the leadership
remaining exercised by a group around Rocker. This leadership supported
some pacifist positions, was opposed to the bombings and sabotages and
defended a frontist position, putting forward the first since 1918, the
watch-word of unification with all the centrist tendencies (from the spartakists
to the USPD): the political social front. It took position against the
movement of March/April 1920 in the Ruhr, against the action of March 1921
(both labelled as putschist), against sabotage actions of trains which
brought weapons to the bourgeoisie to put down the revolution in Poland,...
It violently sabotaged the communist lefts unification attempts (2).
<p>11. One of the strong points of the proletarian struggle was the more
generalized armament in answer to the SPD's calls to lay down arms. Every
workers' association was practically centralized by a programmatical recognition
of three essential points: denunciation of the social-democrats, claiming
of the dictatorship of the proletariat and generalized armament of the
class.
<p>12. Considering the inability of the SPD to disarm the proletariat,
the bourgeoisie tempts a harder answer. Kapp and his generals get rid of
their social-democrat ally and organize a coup.
<p>13. The SPD and the USPD put forward the watch-word of general strike
against the coup. The proletariat answers by direct action and the claiming
of generalized armament and of the dictatorship of the proletariat.
<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">D. The insurrection in the Ruhr</font></u></h2>
14. In the Ruhr, where the first fights take place, the Red Army organizes
itself spontaneously. The revolutionaries (as Appel and Pl&auml;ttner,...)
rush up from various regions of Germany to take part to its constitution,
its armament, its fortification through the occupations of barracks and
strategic points,... Everywhere, the proletariat disarms the Free Corps
and goes gradually from the defensive action to the armed insurrection.
<p>This process of armament and military centralization leads to an occupation
of the Ruhr and a generalization of the fights to practically all the regions
of Germany. A call is made for the military organization of the proletariat,
around organizations from which every supporter of the bourgeois democracy
is expelled.
<p>Action committees act thus as revolutionary military leadership and
the Red Army goes then into offensive against the Reichswehr which withdraws,
and is dispersed; Kapp runs away from Berlin. The insurrection is enlarged
to be victorious in all the cities of the Ruhr, from east to west up to
the Rhine, controlled at the west bank by the French army.
<p>The three main centres of the insurrection are set up around the action
committees of Hagen, Essen and M&uuml;lheim (but there exists much more
military leaderships!); in M&uuml;lheim, the presence of the communist
militants expelled from the KPD some months earlier, at the leadership
of
the action committee is especially strong.
<p>15. The process of exacerbation of the social confrontation is going
to lead to a clarification of the role of the various opposing forces.
<p>On one hand, the KPD is going more than ever to constitute the backbone
of the counterrevolution and to tempt to bring back in the social-democracy,
the process of rupture started up by the proletariat towards this same
social-democracy: the KPD is first going to slow down the movement while
refusing to support the general strike launched against Kapp, while denouncing
as "adventurist" the armament of the proletariat, while calling for staying
on a defensive position within factories,... to tempt then to take the
lead of the movement through the negotiations around the formation of a
"workers'" government.
<p>On another hand, the various communist groupings which are developing
in rupture with the centrist expressions, gathers in a community of action,
where the communists coming out from the KPD, collaborate in a more or
less organized way with elements in rupture with the FAUD. The practical
regrouping of the revolutionaries centralizing themselves from the ruptures
with all the fractions of social-democracy, breaks once more the social-democrat
myth of the separation between "Marxists" and "anarchists".
<p>The KPD will have a global policy against the insurrection. Facing the
generalization of the insurrection, the KPD will progressively disarm the
movement while submitting it to a policy of negotiation. It will oppose
assemblyism to direct action aiming so to bring back the workers to the
bosom of democracy. In Chemnitz, Brandler is the caricature of this: he
is opposed to the Max H&ouml;lz's armed detachments while denouncing him
as agitator, he avoids by all means the armament of the proletariat and
the widening of the struggle, he advocates some new elections facing the
bankruptcy of the bourgeois that the proletariat has just brought down,
he calls for the unity at any price with the social-democrats, he submits
the direct initiatives of proletarians to the diktat of the big assemblies
democracy,...
<p>16. The international bourgeoisie becomes unified against the insurrection
of the Ruhr. Even the French State manages to leave aside its particular
interests towards its will to occupy the Ruhr, to allow a better unification
against the proletariat.
<p>17. The trade-unionist Legien calls for the formation of a workers'
government, KPD included. The USPD and the KPD sign the Bielefeld agreements
with the SPD. These agreements were centred on the means to succeed in
the disarmament of the proletariat. The representatives of the KPD, present
at the agreements, accept the idea of a workers' government composed by
the three parties (SPD, USPD, KPD). However, they will be disarmed by the
leadership of the KPD which will rather pronounce itself in favour of a
"loyal opposition" (!) policy, committing to give up to prepare any violent
action against the government, in order to create "a bourgeois democracy
situation to fight against the capitalism".
<p>18. The Red Army refuses the Bielefeld agreements, but, disorientated
by the policy of the KPD, the insurrection rushes headlong into the crushing.
The proletarians draw the lessons while denouncing the KPD as party of
the Capital. The formation of the KAPD in 1920 was the answer of the proletariat
to this process.
<p>19. The birth of the KAPD in April 1920 expressed a programmatical quality
jump in the organic centralization, in time and space, of the various communist
groups in Germany and of the practice they had assumed until there, while
leading direct action to the heart of all the big revolutionary fights
since the early war, while tempting to organize a rupture with the bolshevized
Third International, while leading internationalist actions aiming to reinforce
the proletariat independently of the national frontiers, while assuming
organizationally the programmatical ruptures with the various centrist
and social-democrat
fractions (SPD, USPD, Spartakists, KPD, national-bolshevism,
leninism, "revolutionary" confidential men,...), while assuming a leadership
of the Unions and other proletarian associations stemming from the struggles,...
<p>Through whole of this experience and this revolutionary practice, the
communists within the KAPD could practically affirm their programmatical
ruptures (3).
<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">Conclusion</font></u></h2>

<h3>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">1. About Social-democracy</font></u></h3>
"This was not an accidental catastrophe but, on the contrary, a logical
stage for a movement of which evolution, since the congress of Erfurt,
had always tended in this sense." J. Knief in "Arbeiter Politik" - 24th
June 1916.
<p>With the experience of the struggles in Germany, the communists affirmed
the programmatical understanding of an invariance of the essence of social-democracy
(and of capital generally speaking) and of the communists' tasks: the revolution
must go through the destruction of social-democracy and through the organization
of the communists outside and against it.
<p>Through the successive ruptures that the communist hard cores assumed,
social-democracy has been unveiled as historic force, much larger than
such or such formal organization. It was revealed as impersonal force bound
to the adjusting program of the capitalistic exploitation. Its characteristic
and its force is to pass the necessary adjusting of the capitalistic system
as the program for the proletariat.
<p>All along this historic phase briefly defined and described above, in
its daily struggle practice, the proletariat rejected the social-democracy
while associating outside and against the SPD and its trade-unions. This
rejection is expressed before 1914 by the calls to get organized outside
the SPD; it is reflected in the watch-word outside and against the Second
International, as well as in the understanding of the SPD as being the
backbone of the Capital in Germany; it occurs again in the denunciation
of the USPD, and especially of luxemburgism, as radical expressions of
social-democracy (cf. Wolfheim's and Laufenberg's criticisms), and at last
in the understanding and the rupture with the KPD as becoming a left-wing
of social-democracy.
<h3>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">2. About revolutionary parliamentarianism</font></u></h3>
At all the stages of the struggle, the communists were in confrontation
with the revolutionary parliamentarianism:
<p>* in November 1918, the communists recognize the newly created councils
as structures subsumed by the centrists who tempt to make new small "between
revolutionaries" parliamentary tribunes from them: "... one week of experience
was enough to realize that the compromise (with the social-democrat SPD
and USPD) is intolerable; the revolutionary and counterrevolutionary currents
cannot unify." Otto R&uuml;hle and his group, when they leave the Council
of Dresden, 16th November 1918.
<p>* in December 1918, the German Communist Party is created and the foundation
congress is marked by the majority opposition to the involvement to the
elections and to the work in trade-unions.
<p>* in March 1920, the communists oppose the generalization of the armament
and of the insurrection to the assemblyism and negotiation orders of Brandler,
Levi and Co.
<p>* in April 1920, the KAPD is founded in rupture with the reformist orientations
of the KPD, and on basis of a total opposition to parliamentarianism, "revolutionary"
or not,...
<p>* in June 1921, militants of the KAPD go to the 3rd congress of the
CI with the aim of organizing an opposition there, while starting from
the opposition towards the revolutionary parliamentarianism.
<p>The social-democracy presents socialism as the result of an electoral
victory and the government occupation by the "Party"; the revolutionary
parliamentarianism emerges of this conception while presenting as a rupture
with this last. The main postulate of the defenders of this tactics is
that the parliament can be used like a tribune to spread the proletarian
ideas.
<p>In total rupture with this conception, the communists situated the heart
of the social contradiction on this question between, on the one hand,
the Party of the reform of Capital, necessarily interested to attract the
revolutionaries in the nets of democracy, to drown the communist action
in the parliamentary chitchat and the electoral preparation, and, on the
other hand, the Party of revolution, which knows this is not while picking
holes in the bourgeois tribunes that the proletariat draws near to the
historic goal, but well by the organization of direct action and the preparation
of the insurrection. The strength of the proletariat strengthens in the
practice, by the assumation of the whole organisative process which ensues
from this last processes.
<p>In the heart of the debate which opposed revolutionaries and centrists
during all these years, there was the problem of the State. It is the understanding
of the nature of the State, of the role of the proletariat and its vanguard
towards this one (the matter is not about occupying the State, but to destroy
it!), that lead the communists to break with the centrist tactics. The
parliament is a device of the bourgeois State which it is the duty of the
revolution to destroy.
<h3>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">3. About proletarian associationism</font></u></h3>
In the heat of the revolutionary struggle, the vanguard of the proletariat
practically demonstrated that it had appropriated a lot of important programmatical
ruptures formulated before, during and after the war by various communist
minorities (the "Linksradikalen" in Bremen, the "Tribunists" in Holland,
the Borchardt's group in Berlin, the ISD, IKD, etc.).
<p>The revolutionary experience in Germany produced an exceptional wealth
of organization forms and discussions about these forms: territorial and
factories organizations, revolutionary syndicalism, councils, unions,...
These discussions provoke ruptures with social-democracy. They crystallize,
in Germany, the preoccupation of the movement all over the world. The forms
of association and organization are the expression of the evolution of
the relations of forces. As this, in the practice of the struggle, the
proletariat gives itself the organisative forms corresponding to the state
of the struggles. In the evolution of the revolutionary movement, the requirements
of revolution call for forms adapted to these. The revolution must therefore
assume these upheavals for fear of succumbing under the ossified, brought
into line forms.
<p>The social-democracy will tempt each time to destroy the process of
the proletarian associationism while leading the struggle astray on the
defense of the existing organizations. The renewal of leadership doesn't
change the nature of an organization, this one doesn't restore; and this
is how the communist movement endows itself at each time with new organs.
<p>From there the invariant watch-word emerges: "let's organize outside
and against trade-unions". The force of the communist vanguards in Germany
was to practically assume this position and to affirm the dictatorship
of the proletariat while associating and while getting organized at many
levels trying always more to centralize itself, setting up thus new class
associations expressing always more the dictatorship of the proletariat.
<h3>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">4. About Luxemburgism</font></u></h3>
Luxemburgism is a social-democrat ideology using again in a more radical
way the Lenin's and Luxemburg's arguments on the necessity of the mass
party, of workers' democracy,... The "assembly" looks like the means to
affirm the democracy for workers, and the "council", like the finally found
form for the revolution, is the new name of the parliament supposed guaranteeing
the revolutionary course.
<p>This ideology, stemming from the back surge of the struggles and from
militants organized around the GIK between 1926 and 1940, is based on the
opposition of form of Luxemburg towards Lenin as well as on the Rosa Luxemburg's
sublimated practice after the war triggering off.
<p>It is today repeated by new councillist groups, which want to ignore
that the "spartakist" hard core regrouped around Luxemburg and Liebknecht,
as well as those who gave it a continuity within the KPD, practically materialized,
and at every stage of the struggle, the party of the negotiation against
the party of direct action. Each time the proletariat will affirm a quality
jump in the confrontation to the bourgeoisie (January 1919 in Berlin, March
1920 in the Ruhr,...) and in the rupture with a level of centralization
of its forces dominated by the centrism (rupture with the USPD, rupture
with the "right-wing" of the KPD, rupture with the KPD, later,...), these
hard cores whose the councillists today praise, constituted the centrist
forces which put a break on the rupture, calling to take the dominant ideology
within the workers into account, drowning the vanguards just because getting
organized "where are the masses", leading thus each time the party of revolution
to turn into party of workers' democracy and of negotiation, thus throwing
the door wide open to the reorganization of the counterrevolution by its
"bloody dogs".
<p>The most "glorious" and the most accomplished demonstrations of the
hard cores, that today the councillists are claiming, were among others:
<p>* Rosa Luxemburg's and her partisans' opposition to the revolutionary
rupture process with centrism within the KPD, during its foundation: it
will prevent the classist split between the communist hard cores working
to the preparation of the revolution and advocating the leaving of the
trade-unions, and the centrists advocating the electoral preparation and
the collaboration with the trade-unions.
<p>* the policy of negotiation and indecision facing the SPD/USPD during
the insurrection of January 1919 in Berlin, preparing thus their own martyrdom.
<p>* the affirmation of the process which permitted to empty the KPD of
its revolutionary pith, to set it up in driving force of the counterrevolution
during the insurrection starting from the Ruhr.
<p>As expression of social-democracy as historic force, Luxemburgism is
a particular form of centrism, since it directly starts from the fundamental
preoccupations of the revolution to affirm the victory of workers' democracy
upon the proletariat.
<p>Luxemburgist ideology is notably based on the vision that the formal
organizations are always late towards the proletarian struggle which revolutionizes
them and revitalize them during the revolutionary rises. It is therefore
in the mass strike, action which goes beyond the organizations, that their
putting right is possible.
<p>Luxemburgism therefore advocates the permanent contact with the masses,
which may only be done through the organizations regrouping them. In fact,
"the worst workers' party is better than no party at all" (Rosa Luxemburg),
history being in charge of putting things back in their own place.
<p>Luxemburgism, with the leftist argument to be where are the workers,
fights against the communist ruptures and aim to re-frame its hard cores
in social-democracy while preventing their real centralization around a
revolutionary program.
<h3>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">5. About some current myths</font></u></h3>
Concerning the lessons of the revolutionary and counterrevolutionary movement
in Germany, we see emerging in the centrist ideology a lot of mythical
and idealist explanations trying to explain the revolutionary defeat by
the lack of centralization of the struggle (what is always true!) while
particularly denouncing the movement for its supposed federalism, and for
the vanguard's anti-partitism...
<p>Although there are always deficiencies at a time where the revolution
doesn't yet impose its absolute dictatorship against the bourgeoisie; for
us, one of the highest moments of the revolution/counterrevolution confrontation
happened in Germany, and the big force of the revolution, contrary to the
big centrist tales about the supposed federalism of the revolutionaries
in Germany, has precisely shown:
<p>A/ in a permanent process of rupture with the bourgeois organizations
(SPD, USPD, ADGB,...) and much more specifically, with organizations stemming
from the proletariat in its struggle, and brought into line by the bourgeoisie
(KPD, FVDG, FAUD, councils...).
<p>B/ the continuous research and creation of programmatico-organizational
centralization levels every time higher.
<p>The force of the counterrevolution marked its paroxysm in the recuperation
of the KPD by the centrism, its fast and violent integration in the bourgeois
State and its constitution as backbone of the counterrevolution, assuming
in depth its function of struggle-breaker during the highest moment of
the revolutionary offensive, that is to say during the generalization of
the insurrectionary movement of March 1920 started from the Ruhr and central
Germany. The communist answer to the destruction of revolution by the KPD,
asserted itself one month later, as reaction of our class' life in the
revolutionary forces centralization around a new organization: the KAPD.

The communists in Germany always had the reputation for being antipartitists,
anti-centralists, anti-formalistics. This fairy tale is only a creation
of social-democracy in its effort to be self-glorifying under all its expressions:
Leninist, bordiguist, councillist,...
<p>The central problem was the role to play by the minorities towards the
destruction of the State. For the centrism in its Leninist version, the
destruction occurs thanks to propaganda and education that the Party would
bring through parliamentarianist, frontist, syndicalist,... tactics; the
dictatorship of the proletariat, as for it, is dissolved in workers' governments!
This leads to the theorizing of the mass Party.
<p>To this falsification of their objectives and their methods, the communists
opposed the program of the revolution: the bourgeois State is destroyed
in the process of the revolutionary struggles of the proletariat. During
this process, the proletariat is brought to create its own organs, to build
its power, and the communists' task is to constitute themselves into a
party to lead this process. This party is a hard core cemented by the struggle
around the program of revolution, it is produced by the struggle, for the
struggle. It is by this practical affirmation of a force organized around
clear principles guiding the disruption of the whole world, that the leadership
of the revolution is due to the communist party.
<p>In the rupture with the counterrevolution, the communists in Germany
place themselves outside and against the bourgeois polarization between
(democratic) centralism and federalism. This process of rejection, rich
of negation, already draws the fundamental orientations of the programmatical
bases of the organic centralism. The communist minorities in Germany asserted
with force their centralization around the communist program and their
organization into a party, whose ruling action has such a centrifugal force
that each member has the tendency to represent and to reproduce the totality.
<p>In the same way, the organization of the proletariat into a Party is
understood as being directly worldwide (all the organisative efforts of
the communists in Germany were called "internationalist"). The International
cannot be the addition of various national parties. The CI is considered
like an effort of proletarian internationalism aiming to the destruction
of the world State, but its degeneration didn't prevent the communists
to denounce the resurgence of social-democracy within it. The KAPD will
send out several delegations in Moscow in order to tempt to stop the course
followed by the CI; they will organize thereafter a rupture with the International,
eaten into by the centrism, while tempting to organize an opposition ready
to assume the constitution of a new international force, first inside,
then outside and against what they denounced as a more and more reformist
organization ("Your tactics is still the one of the Second International!"
- H. Gorter).

<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">Notes</font></u></h3>
1. We only agree with the terminology "left communists" used to designate
the revolutionary forces stemming from the period 1917-23, as historic
denomination, as historic materialization of a rupture with the social-democracy.
Those designated by the counterrevolution as "left" communist are, mostly,
<b>the real and only real communists of this period.</b> They don't have
programmatically -and in spite of the common terminology imposed by the
revisionist history-, any things in common with those they were, in fact,
continually opposing to all along their fight.
<p>The fact that Lenin -and behind him other red-painted social-democrats,
other speech "communists"-, persisted to denounce the communists as "infantile
sicks", as "anarchists", as "leftists", as "anti-partitists",..., is only
the demonstration of the demarcation that growed every time clearer between
the Bolsheviks' counterrevolutionary policy and the revolutionary expressions
which continued to fight against the current of the centrism.
<p>Lenin for himself, while he stood in a process of practical rupture
with the social-democracy of which he stemmed from, while reaffirming in
April 1917 the revolutionary theses of the proletariat, was found himself
accused of being an "anarchist" and a new "Bakunin".
<p>The "communist" definition, as Marx said, is not determined by what
a militant says from himself, but well by what he makes, that is to say
therefore by his real communist action.
<p>The "left" communism doesn't exist no more than the "right" or "centre"
communism. Communism can be defined in and by the revolutionary practice
of men who fights for the destruction of the State, and stand therefore
on the point of view of the destruction of the Army, the Nations, the organs
of capitalistic management, Capital and Work, etc.
<p>This is not innocently that the left-wing of the social-democrats put
so much determination to denounce as "infantile", "sick" and "agitator",
those who were opposed to their policy of reconstruction and management
of the State, those who advocated the revolutionary war against the peace
agreements with the bourgeoisie, those who fought against the entryism
in the trade-unions and the revolutionary parliamentarianism. The social-democrats
-and we speak here in historic and not forrmal terms, in terms of the forces
which apart from their denomination practically assumes the reform of the
world!- intended so to appropriate for their own, the "communist" title
(without other word), because it was the surest way, at a time where the
revolution was on the agenda, to protect themselves of all who would denounce
their practice of reconstruction of the State as counterrevolutionary.
<p>And as they could not deny the revolutionary character ("the good intentions",
they would say!) of the actions of those who were opposed to them, they
attributed to the communist militants the "left" adjective, to designate
them as "sick" as well as to stand on a political line, where no qualitative
rupture does appear, not even in the terminology.
<p>In our texts, we sometimes use pleonasms as "revolutionary communist",
"internationalist communists" or even this distortion expressed by "left
communist", whereas we don't accept the terminology of our enemies. It
is because the weight of history rewritten by the stalinists and other
right- or left-wing bourgeois, is, like all ideology, a force which materialized
all along these seven decades of counterrevolution. We must resort to such
rough tricks of language to distinguish ourselves from all those -and they
are numerous!- who have thus violently looted our flags.
<p>2. This short part about the syndicalist, anarchist and other organizations,
only to point out <b>the method and the framework
</b>to give for a wider
research, that is to say the formalistic nonattachment to denominations
or origins often confused of these organizations. Our analysis starts from
what the revolutionary practice within, and sometimes against these organizations,
determined as rupture between revolution and counterrevolution. It is probably
the part of our work about the revolution in Germany, for which we don't
yet reached a sufficient level of homogenization.
<p>3. We are aware that there is here a development missing around the
rupture points formulated by the militants who were centralized around
the KAPD: this organization constituted politically the clearest workers'
association during all this period. As real internationalists, the militants
of the KAPD carried all their efforts on the organization of actions putting
up the development of the revolution at the international level; they also
tempted to organize the "lefts" within and against the erring ways of the
Third International in order to organize, when the impossibility to fight
further on this ground appeared, a consequent rupture with the CI.
<p>On the other hand, the work at the sources (newspapers of the KAPD,
etc.) about the discussions within the KAPD, between R&uuml;hle, Gorter,
Roche, Appel, etc. should allow us to deepen, then to homogenize our understanding
of the ruptures which occurred within the KAPD.
