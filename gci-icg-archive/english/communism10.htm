With each bourgeois commemoration, the masters of historical falsification
expend all their talent in reinforcing their hold over the amnesiac mass
of citizens. In 1989 the bourgeoisie celebrated, in the course of the bicentenary
of the so-called "French Revolution" (1), the purified reign of democracy
and its sacrosanct "Human Rights": "Liberty" to sell your labour power,
"Equality" in exploitation and "Fraternity" between classes. During the
fall of the Berlin Wall they made great preemptory clarion calls about
<i>"the
victory of democracy over totalitarianism", "the failure of communism"</i>
and even <i>"the end of history"</i>... in short, these are ideal occasions
for reinforcing the enlarged and structured framework of democracy as the
only possible outcome for the future of humanity.
<p>The sickening ceremonies of commemoration of the "Liberation" followed
the same strategy. These campaigns of promotion of democracy addressed
themselves directly to isolated individuals, the basic kernel of this society,
in order to integrate them, to fuse them together, to gather them behind
the defence of the State. Even if today the gigantic media shows, organising
lasers and noise in the street or in a packed stadium, have replaced the
great Nazi masses of yesteryear, like the Nuremburg rallies and torch-lit
marches with their compact, disciplined crowds in orderly ranks... all
these mobilisations contribute very well and in an identical fashion to
the same irrational and collective communion of adhesion to the fictive
community of capital. Did not Hitler affirm, in his megalomaniac pretensions,
just like "our" experts and economists today, that he had put an end to
the existence of classes for at least a thousand years? In the manipulation
of crowds and their irrational emotions, anti-fascism plays on the same
scale as fascism. During the great collective masses, the bourgeois project
affirms itself openly as was it is: a logic of the market tempered in steel,
excluding any other approach to the future of humanity apart from that
of the capitalist mode of production. Obtaining the adhesion of the isolated
individual to the Nation, to the Community of citizens requires that the
war which can be seen every day between those who possess everything and
those who have nothing but their labour power must be definitively hidden.
So every critique is banished, every calling into question of the official
historiography is equivalent to "revisionism". Here we can see how the
fascist and anti-fascist myths have as their principal function the gathering
of citizens into a fraternisation with the State and must serve as an outlet
to reassure each person as to their future and above all the war-like future
which capital is preparing.
<p>Concealed behind this unanimous concert, the real causes and objectives
of the war, which put the planet to fire and blood from 1939 to 1945, along
with the causes of all the other wars, are more than ever hidden by a vast
media campaign which promotes "the horror of the camps", "Nazi cruelty",
"the excesses of war"... On one side the "goodies", on the other the "baddies".
Apart from this truth there is nothing! The "anti-fascists" (2) quickly
wash away their own massacres in the foul-smelling waters of the horrors
of their fascist competitors. The bourgeois polarisation of fascism/anti-fascism
functions as the two jaws of the same vice in organising the conscription
of proletarians into two enemy camps, ending up inexorably in the preparation
of a new "final solution" to social antagonisms: WAR!
<p>In this struggle between the anti-fascist and fascist camps no one had
the monopoly in the domain of "horror" and "barbarism". The two competitors,
thirsting in the frantic search for new possibilities of profits, <b>both
responded to the same necessities imposed by capital</b> to take destruction
and death to a level never seen before. The totalitarian reign of democracy,
the highest expression of capitalist civilisation, is thus crystallised
in these moments of human prehistory that constitute the concentration
camps, nuclear bombs, battle-fields, massive bombardments, war taken to
extremes. It is under these terms that there materialised, to a degree
unknown until then, a complete negation of the human species by class societies.
We shall see here that, concerning this atrocious war which flaunted itself
from 1939 to 1945, the British, American, Russian, "allied", anti-fascist
bourgeois really had nothing to envy the fascists for in their capacity
to plan death.

<font face="Comic Sans MS">oOo</font></h2></center>
In this text we will illustrate, on several occasions, the bourgeoisie's
capacity to consciously realise the central objective of war for the reorganisation
of capital: the destruction of productive forces and the destruction of
the proletariat. Using various examples, we show how the massive destruction
of the proletariat is carried out with impressive cynicism and consciousness.
Does this imply a machiavellian viewpoint of history? Or the abandonment
of dialectical materialism? No - and this for various reasons.
<p>The first is that, above all, the bourgeoisie realises its class objectives
and subjective expressions of the capitalist social system by seeking to
liquidate its immediate enemy in war: by destroying its infrastructure,
logistics and by the liquidation and demoralisation of its troops and working
population, so indispensible on the productive front.
<p>Secondly, the worldwide bourgeoisie has drawn lessons from past wars
and revolutions and every bourgeois fraction is haunted by the spectre
of Russia in 1917. Whilst revolutionaries at that time were hoping for
a resurgence of the class out of the catastrophe of the war, all capital's
military and civilian strategists knew that what they had to fear most
was proletarian revolt in capital's most disorganised cities, in particular
in countries such as Italy and Germany in which the army was disintegrating
(as was also the case in Russia, despite the fact that this state was on
the "winning" side of the war).
<p>Lastly, although certain bourgeois fractions have always been aware
that their system needs imperialist war, particularly the destruction of
large sections of the proletariat in order to impose a cycle of successful
accumulation, the bourgeoisie cannot voluntarily change the course of history.
The bourgeoisie is not the subject of history, but always and necessarily
a puppet of capital carrying out its determinations independently of consciousness,
always relative, by one or another protagonist.
<p>In summary, the bourgoisie as a class does not do what it wants, but
what its social system historically obliges it to do. This does not imply
that we are ignoring that certain fractions of the dominant class act with
consciousness and determination to maintain their social system. They always
bear it in mind that, beyond their immediate enemy (the opposite side in
imperialist war), it is a trap for their historical enemy (the proletariat)
and these fractions do not spare any effort in their machiavellian preparation
for its massacre.
<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font color="#FF6666">Terror From the Sky</font></font></u></h2>
From 1940, the British strategy put in place by "Bomber Command", the Head
Quarters of those flying heavy bombers, had as its objective the massive
scattering of death and destruction on German towns. To justify putting
in place such a veritable strategy of terror, to ideologically cover its
launch, the British bourgeoisie used the bombings of London and Coventry
during the Autumn of 1940 and those of Rotterdam by their German competitors,
deliberately exaggerating their extent. With the ideological misinformation
thus orchestrated, the brass-hats were able to put all the science of killing
at the service of sick capitalism. In March 1942, they affirmed:
<blockquote><i>"An offensive of extensive bombing could sap the morale
of the enemy <b>provided they are directed against the workers' districts</b></i>
[our emphasis] <i>of 58 German towns, each one having a population of 100,000
inhabitants. Between March 1942 and the middle of 1943, it should be possible
to make a third of the total population of Germany homeless."</i></blockquote>

<blockquote>(Final Report of Professor Lindemann from 30 March 1942 at
the request of Bomber Command)</blockquote>
While the bourgeoisie has the advantage of being so clear amongst themselves,
a second discourse was very rapidly put into place with a view to reinforcing,
amongst the citizens of the "free world", the belief that the anti-fascist
camp was organising the war in a humanitarian way. It was obviously a question
of presenting "barbarism" and cruelty as being the unique prerogative of
the opposing camp. Mystification feeds off itself - it turned out to be
necessary to reinforce its impact amongst the crowds submitted to the war
project of the bourgeoisie in their confiding that:
<blockquote><i>"... Bomber Command only bombs for purely military purposes
and only aims at achieving military objectives, any suggestions of attacks
on working class or residential areas we reject as absurd and an attack
on the honour of the airmen who sacrifice their lives for their country..."</i></blockquote>
However, despite all the lies intended to camouflage the sinister reality,
nothing was going to stop the bourgeoisie, with all its characteristic
cynicism, from specifying more precisely the aim of these bombings: systematic
carnage.
<blockquote><i>"... it is clear that the aiming points are to be the built-up
areas, <b>not</b>, for instance, the dockyards or aircraft factories...
This must be made quite clear if it is not already understood."</i></blockquote>

<blockquote>(Report of the Chief of Air Staff Sir Charles Portal, 14 February
1942)</blockquote>
After three years of putting in place various bombing strategies, the degree
of precision of terror reached a very appreciable level of effectiveness.
At this point, more than a hundred four-engined aircraft would take part
in successive waves of bombing of a single town. The first highly bloody
illustration of this reality was the bombing of Wuppertal in May 1943,
where the military objectives concentrated in the Elberfeld district were
at first systematically avoided in favour of the workers' residential districts
of Barmen.
<p>But the anti-fascist pole, like its fascist competitor, came to surpass
itself in the organisation of horror. Capital, suffering from devalorisation
as if from a cancer, couldn't find provisory relief in any other remedy
than the growth of its destructive capacity. It is in effect <b>during
war and by war</b> that this dying system reaches the high point of the
overturning and complete revolutionising of its productive base, permitting
it thus to create new conditions for assuring a new phase of valorisation.
<b>Physical
destruction pure and simple</b> of the means of production is only at bottom
the pursuit of the commercial war that the various competitors abandon
themselves to even more than usual. For open war earns its keep not only
in the area of development of the productive forces, but also in its extension
in the military economy. It should not be surprising therefore that that
epoch was one in which new inventions, new technologies, new concepts saw
the light of day. It is still and always in death that the white-coated
worshippers of Mammon surpass themselves. While the V1 rocket was being
patiently elaborated on the fascist side, in July 1943 the bombardment
of Hamburg by anti-fascist aircraft marked the inauguration of the <b>era
of fire-storms.</b> It was by the massive utilisation of incendiary bombs
that the death of more than 50,000 people was to be caused, along with
40,000 wounded on the same occasion. The centre of the town was entirely
destroyed and, in three nights, the total number of victims in Hamburg
reached, without entering here into a polemic of macabre figures, the number
killed on the British side during the whole duration of the war. After
this it was the turn of Kassel where, in October 1943, 10,000 civilians
would perish as if in a giant brasier. The fire-storms materialised the
capacity of Capital to refine and rationalise death to an ever greater
extent:
<blockquote><i>"... the sudden linking of a great number of fires, the
air above was heated to such an extent that a violent updraught occurred
which, in turn, caused the surrounding fresh air to be sucked in from all
sides to the centre of the fire area. This tremendous suction caused movements
of air of far greater force than normal winds. In meteorology the differences
of temperature involved are of the order of 20&deg; to 30&deg;C. In this
fire-storm they were of the order of 600&deg;, 800&deg; or even 1000&deg;C.
This explained the colossal force of the fire-storm winds... No sort of
civilian protection measure can ever contain a fire-storm once it has emerged.
They are clearly monsters created by man</i> <b>[sic, we would say Capital!]</b><i>which
no man can ever tame."</i></blockquote>

<blockquote>(Report of the Police President of Hamburg of the bombing of
July 1943)</blockquote>
The only response to this unprecedented human genocide was to be found
in the concrete shelters where the inhabitants crammed themselves, like
frightened animals, in the hope of escaping the explosions and flames.
But in these bunkers, transformed into gigantic pressure cookers, men,
women, children... were done in inexorably by lack of oxygen or by being
cooked, literally like meat on a grill.
<blockquote><i>"When the rescue teams finally, at the end of several weeks,
forced their way into the bunkers and the hermetically sealed houses, the
heat created inside had been so intense that there was nothing left of
their occupants: they found only a fine layer of undulating grey dust in
one bunker, they could only estimate the number of victims as being between
250 and 300 (...) The abnormal temperatures in these bunkers were also
attested to by the pools of melted metal which were originally the pots,
pans and cooking utensils kept in the houses."</i> (3)</blockquote>
Faced with the scale of damage caused to civilian populations, questions
began to be asked. It was impossible to unload all those bombs without
causing horrifying damage to civilians. Invariably the anti-fascist British
government responded to this with the same assurance and the same arrogance:
<blockquote><i>"... no instruction has been given to destroy dwelling houses
... the targets of Bomber Command are always military."</i></blockquote>

<blockquote>(Secretary of State for the Air Sir Archibald Sinclair, 31
March 1943)</blockquote>
Then, in the world of lies erected into a system of a single permitted
thought, the useful idiot of capital continues to swallow and reproduce
the dominant discourse. The infernal round of bombers, carrying in their
holds the future promise of good business, once more carried out the aim
of foretold carnage, and returned again. During 1944, perfecting their
technique to the point where not a single square meter of an inhabited
area could escape the incendiary bombs, raids on K&ouml;nigsberg (end of
August), Darmstadt (September), Braunschweig (October), Heilbronn (December),
Bremerhaven etc. claimed many tens of thousands of victims, caught in the
jaws of gigantic brasiers. Ideological misinformation remained total and,
day after day, hundreds of bombers, dropping thousands and thousands of
bombs, took off from Britain for Germany. For the man in the street this
represented the adequate response to the horrors of the other camp.
<p>While public opinion mumbled the stupidities that its masters concocted
for it, on both sides of the front, others arranged to remove all traces
of the desired carnage, thought out and organised with full knowledge of
what would happen. Thus, the American General Eaker declared at the same
time:
<blockquote><i>"We should never allow the history of this war to convict
us of throwing the strategic bomber at the man in the street."</i></blockquote>
All the same, fifteen days before this declaration, a raid carried out
by American bombers on Berlin had caused the death of 25,000 people, something
that this brass-hatted jackal did not ignore. You can't help thinking again
about the lies and cynicism which prevailed during the whole of the Gulf
War (4), and discovering there a long and solid tradition, not only in
the US Army, but equally in all of the bourgeoisie past and future. Lies
which have no other aim than to mask the gigantic effort which leads this
capitalist society to perfect its arsenal of terror and destruction. War
represents for it a gigantic living laboratory of technological experiments
and above all a gigantic source of profits.
<p>If the fascist camp came to profit from putting in place a great number
of scientific discoveries such as the V1 and V2 rockets, thanks to the
concentration camp slaves, what can be said about their direct competitors?
Bombs which were always bigger, always more powerful and still more destructive
were systematically developed. Thus, faced with the ineffectiveness of
traditional bombs, which rarely hit their target, armour-piercing bombs
were developed, so that a maximum number of proletarians could be massacred.
They must have known that during bombardments, when proletarians buried
themselves in subterranean dwellings or cellars, the explosion of a classic
bomb on impact with a building would only take place most of the time at
the highest part of the building. The genius of the bourgeoisie therefore
came to struggle to get the better of the bomb fodder, who were not allowing
themselves to be massacred so easily. Consequently, the scientific scum,
who never miss a dirty trick, invented an armament capable of finding the
human flesh where it had hidden itself. It is logical that the bombs should
explode in the deepest rat holes. So, during the first impact, the new
bomb doesn't explode. It goes through the roof, penetrates the floorboards
and only explodes once its real objective is reached: the reinforced cellars.
<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font color="#FF6666">The Everest of Terror:
the Bombing of Dresden</font></font></u></h2>
The torrent of deaths following the aerial bombardments, with workers as
the principal victims, was to reach its paroxysm in Dresden, in February
1945, in the raid which was the most terroristic and the most incomprehensible
of the whole war - incomprehensible to those who still had illusions in
the humanity of the imperialist, anti-fascist camp. From a strictly military
point of view, nothing could justify the additional massacre which took
place when Germany was already defeated. Nothing, if it wasn't the immediate
announcement of the coming end of the blood bath and the obvious desire
of the victorious fraction of the bourgeoisie to destroy everything which
still could be destroyed.
<p>Dresden did not have any strategically vital industry, nor any important
military installation. And it is, moreover, for this reason that the town
constituted a refuge for hundreds of thousands of people fleeing the bombings
and the advance of the Soviet army, another joyous army of massacrers.
Blinded by the propaganda of the Allies, persuaded that Dresden would never
be bombed, all these refugees crammed themselves into the numerous hospitals
of the town and stormed the schools, the railway stations and so on. The
British government did not ignore these facts, and this is true up to a
point that some military chiefs of Bomber Command expressed serious reservations
as to the military validity of such an objective. In effect it was something
difficult to swallow, even for the pilots, that a few weeks before the
end of the war, when on all fronts the German troops were in open retreat
and disarray, that there could exist any military objective in the organisation
of the biggest massacre of the whole war. To this, it was drily replied
that Dresden constituted a <b>priority</b> objective: in the midst of the
Yalta conference, it was a question of putting themselves in a position
of strength, thanks to the bombings, in the face of the rapid advance of
Russian troops.
<p>The bombing of the town took place on 13 and 14 February 1945. The bourgeoisie
wasn't unaware that there were close to a million and a half people, of
which a great number were refugees from the province of Silesia, many injured,
prisoners of war, labour deportees... The greatest tonnage of bombs ever
used was thus unloaded over two nights: close to 3000 tonnes, 650,000 incendiary
bombs fell on the town, producing the biggest fire-storm of the whole war.
The fire winds which consumed the town travelled at from 200 to 300km per
hour. Dresden would burn for eight days during which the glow of the fire
would be visible from 300 kilometres! Some parts of the town burned so
strongly that it would only be several weeks later that the cellars could
be entered. The whole panoply of the most murderous bombs was used: phosphorus,
napalm... People, veritable human torches, threw themselves into the Elbe
where they continued to burn, the flow of fire which descended from the
centre of the town towards the Elbe reached the river and continued to
destroy. Decapitated corpses, victims of "anti-personnel" fragmentation
bombs, littered the streets. Of 35,000 inhabited buildings, only 7,000
remained standing. The whole centre of the town disappeared over an area
of 18km&sup2;. Most of the hospitals were destroyed, while the railways
were hardly touched and neither the military airfield nor the various factories
round about were targeted.
<p>The intervention was carried out in a methodical fashion: those who
conceived it had even taken account of the wind so that the fire could
develop with a horrifying rapidity. On the night of 13 and 14 February
1945, more than a thousand British bombers came to sow terror. The next
day, 450 American Flying Fortresses took up the relay in unloading 771
tonnes of incendiaries, of which a great number were delayed action. This
"novelty" allowed Bomber Command to assure for itself an even more impressive
bag. These bombs, which didn't explode until several hours after the aeroplanes
had passed, would kill not only those who tried to put out the fires, but
all those careless enough to flee from the burning town. The balance sheet
which was without contest one of the highest expressions of Civilisation
and Progress surpassed the figure of 250,000 dead, almost all civilians,
to say nothing of the tens of thousands of wounded, burned, dying, maimed,
insane...
<blockquote><i>"... ten days after the bombing, a group of prisoners had
cleared the steps leading into a basement, but they refused to go in. Something
out of the ordinary had happened inside. The men stood sullenly around
round the basement entrance, as the civilian Director, wishing to set an
example, marched down the steps to the cellar, an acetylene lamp in his
hand. He was reassured by the lack of the usual smell of decay. The bottom
steps were slippery. The cellar floor was covered by a twenty centimetre
deep liquid mixture of blood, flesh and bone; a small high-explosive bomb
had penetrated four floors of the building and exploded in the basement.
(...) They learned from the caretaker of the block that there must have
been 200 to 300 people in the cellar on the night."</i></blockquote>

<blockquote>(Hans Voigt, director of "Abteilung Tote", the "dead person's
bureau" charged with cleaning the city of corpses)</blockquote>
Because of the risk of an epidemic the centre of town was declared to be
off-limits. Each day thousands of bodies, or at least what was left of
them, were dragged into the central square of the town, to be, after a
last attempt at identification, crammed onto pyres of 400 to 500 corpses
to be burnt. Close to 70,000 victims were thus incinerated on the Altmarkt
as a protective measure. For the first time in the history of the war the
survivors were not numerous enough to bury the dead. The apocalypse hit
this region like a thunderbolt. For several weeks a horrible smell of putrefaction
mixed with that of charred human flesh hung over the ruins and the surrounding
area. Packs of dogs roamed the rubble looking for corpses. Ten of thousands
of ghostly figures wandered the roads in search of refuge, with haggard
eyes and in rags, the veritable living dead. It is almost impossible with
these words, or with figures, to be able to describe in its deepest reality
this veritable apocalypse. The vocabulary which we use to communicate today
is too poor to express the disgust, the hatred that is inspired in us by
such a systematic, methodical, scientific organisation of terror, of death!
And the disgust which we feel towards these greatest acts of the anti-fascist
bourgeoisie is all the deeper because of the way that they bury all critique
against themselves by denouncing precisely... <b>the systematic, methodical,
scientific organisation of terror</b> as being the monopoly of their competitors.
Here capital has hit hard, very hard.
<p>But the horror that the bourgeoisie is capable of deploying is without
limit. The Allied hunters went on to machine-gun the columns of refugees
who were fleeing from the town put to fire and blood, just as help was
arriving from the neighbouring areas. Ordering the bombing of Chemnitz
in the days following, the Allied commander didn't mince words, declaring
to the pilots:
<blockquote><i>"The reason you are going there tonight is to finish off
the refugees who managed to escape from Dresden."</i></blockquote>
Like a pack intoxicated by the smell of blood, these guard dogs of capitalism
cried out for new orgies of blood-letting to assuage their hunger for more
corpses. The anti-fascist alliance had decidedly nothing to learn from
the fascist coalition when it comes to the refinement with which they assured
the survival of this moribund civilisation. In 18 months of bombings, 45
of the 60 principal German towns had been completely destroyed, razed,
crushed. At the very least, 650,000 proletarians, the majority civilians,
were to perish in the course of the terror raids, without even mentioning
those who, having escaped this hell, would spend the rest of their lives
in hospitals and lunatic asylums. It is truly on mounds of corpses that
the victory of the anti-fascist camp would be celebrated on 8 May 1945.
<p>A beautiful "Victory" indeed, that of having hidden their own crimes
under the mattress of the horrors of the competitor. A beautiful "Victory"
celebrated with lanterns on a field of corpses!
<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font color="#FF6666">The Capitalist Necessity
for War</font></font></u></h2>
The more Capital develops the more all its contradictions grow, are exacerbated.
It is not by chance that war always exists in one part of the world or
another, that it regularly extends itself in a more and more generalised
form. The struggle to maximise profit, competition, commercial war and
war in general, are as essential to the capitalists as breathing is to
a human being.
<p>It is a matter of fact that this society cannot live without war. To
express it very schematically here (5), the reason is that the mass of
capital grows more rapidly than the possibilities of its valorisation.
Thus, cyclically, an overproduction of capital occurs, having as a consequence
that the valorisation of one part of social capital excludes the valorisation
of another part of the same world social capital. The closure of factories,
or the scrapping of other fixed capitals, is never enough to re-stabilise
the situation. A generalised depression regularly occurs, leading inevitably
to a general devalorisation of all existing capital. When Capital encounters
no possibility of profitability, it must "normally" lead to the generalised
bankruptcy of the less profitable capitals. These, like all the others,
organise themselves to <b>resist</b> this inexorable law of capital. The
organisation of some or other of them, at various levels of centralisation,
with the aim of carrying out this war in the best possible circumstances
(associations, cartels, national states, blocs or constellations of states)
renders war periodically effective: it presents itself as a partial solution
to the problems of world capital. In destroying an important part of capital,
and therefore in preventing the functioning of it, war ameliorates the
general conditions of the whole of world social capital. War thus permits
it to relaunch, on a new basis, a new cycle of valorisation. On the other
hand, this solution only makes the problem even more insoluble for the
capitalists to come. A new phase of overproduction of capital, even more
important than the preceding one, intervenes, making necessary the violent
devalorisation - by destruction - of always more means of production.
<p>The so-called "Second World War" does not escape from these invariable
laws of capitalism. It is not in the head of some Hitler, any more than
in the head of a Stalin or a Truman, that we can find an explanation for
this gigantic carnage, but <b>only</b> in the entrails of this society
that many, above all amongst the proletariat today, find it difficult to
recognise for what it is: a class society. In place of this evidence, the
bourgeoisie presses to reinforce the stupidities that it fabricates for
its public opinion, showering the brave citizen, that sinister <b>homo
democraticus</b>, with commemorations, military parades, stories recounting
the psychology of such and such an idiot useful to capital, with the aim
of making him accept the unacceptable: participation in war to save its
moribund system.
<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font color="#FF6666">... and the proletariat
in all this</font></font></u></h2>
In this text so far we have spoken of the proletariat as an object of history,
as fodder for factories, cannons and bombs. We cannot publish this text
without at least mentioning the <b>tendencies</b> for our class to impose
itself as a subject, fighting for its own interests, imposing communism
as the only affirmation of our humanity. To say <i>"the proletariat is
a class which is exploited AND revolutionary"</i> (K. Marx), is not to
say that it is <b>either</b> exploited <b>or</b> revolutionary, that it
is <b>either</b> the object <b>or</b> the subject of history, but that
it is <b>dialectically</b> both. Even if it was defeated at the end of
the war, if revolution was not the order of the day, if it was enroled
into the bourgeois polarisation fascism/anti-fascism, and above all if
it was crushed by the bombs and the terror, the proletariat, like the old
mole of Marx, nevertheless always manifested itself to some extent as subject,
through its struggles, and in opposition to those who try to reduce it
to a simple object of exploitation.
<p>As we have seen already, far from being limited to a question of interbourgeois
competition, the war strategy of extermination aims to massively liquidate
a maximum of excess productive forces for the valorisation needs of this
society of death. But we cannot limit our analysis to this single aspect
of the question. The elimination of battalions of proletarians, those thousands
of tonnes of bombs dropped on working class areas, materialise the capacity
of our class enemy to preemptively hit every area of proletarian tension.
If the proletariat of the years 1939-45, atomised within the inter-bourgeois
polarisations, failed more or less to recognise itself as the proletariat,
the bourgeoisie, for its part, was able, beyond its ideological divergences,
to hit it wherever the danger appeared, in the impersonal interests of
its World State.
<p>It was also therefore so as not to see a replay of the preceding insurrectional
wave, that the Allied aircraft had as their mission the bombardment, during
the terrorist raids, of not only the German industrial centres, but also
the biggest population centres, massacring and terrorising always more
proletarians. Far from being blind, these bombings were on the contrary
very selective: it was above all working class areas which were the targets
of Allied carpet bombing.
<p>This annihilation was "justified" all the more urgently from the beginning
of 1943, when, amongst concentrations of proletarians in Europe, struggle
and resistance to exploitation once more appeared. Numerous bourgeois myths
perpetuated the idea that the social situation at the end of the war was
peaceful, or at least it was bathed in the consensus of "liberation from
fascism". We want to affirm against the current that, <b>in the whole of
Europe</b> at that time, under the blows of material necessity, <b>threats</b>
of proletarian conflagrations caused the <b>spectre</b> of social revolution
to reappear. A real movement seemed to reemerge, putting forward everywhere
the satisfaction of our needs.
<p>To be sure, <b>1945 was not 1918!</b>... and most of the few nuclei
of revolutionary militants of the period, who managed to maintain a classist
course in the storm of counter-revolution, had to a large extent overestimated
the perspective for struggle, concluding in a mechanical way that a proletarian
uprising was imminent in Germany as in 1918. The sites of struggle which
did appear were rather feeble and above all were marked by more than 25
years of counter-revolutionary terror: 25 years in which the communist
<b>avant-garde</b>
had been liquidated. Over more than two decades the bourgeoisie had perfected
its cycle of counter-revolution and a good number of militants of the wave
of 1917-21 had disappeared into the concentration camps, had been massacred
on the fields of horror, or had even been enroled into the Stalinist parties
and ground down by the "Party of Order".
<p>The world bourgeoisie, taking some lessons from the revolutionary wave,
had given itself such material means so that it no longer had to confront
a disintegrating army, a defeatist proletariat which was turning its arms
against its own generals, against its own bourgeoisie, able to transform
itself into new battalions of revolution. Thanks to the means of destruction
qualitatively and quantitatively superior to the previous phase of <b>this
class war</b>, the bourgeoisie made it their duty to take on class liquidation,
class "genocide", not merely of millions of proletarians in uniform but
also hundreds of thousands of "civilian" proletarians.
<p>It is not by chance either that the terror bombings were systematised
at the moment when important strikes broke out in Germany (and also in
Italy, France, etc. (6)) and when desertions in the German army began to
increase. This is an expression of the complementarity of the "rival" fractions
of the bourgeoisie in anti-proletarian repression. The working class was
caught between the frying pan and the fire: on one side the terror coming
from the sky and, on the other, the firing squads who force the strikers
to continue "war production" for the "final victory".
<p>At the end of the so-called "Second World War" the bourgeoisie closed
off a cycle of war by the temporary neutralisation of the proletariat.
The two world wars were two moments of a gigantic anti-proletarian massacre
extending from 1914 to 1945 and interrupted in 1917-18 by the proletariat
in struggle. It is only on this level of abstraction of the reality of
capital that we can make sense of events which, for bourgeois historians,
prove to be incomprehensible, to be the malicious work of an "evil genius":
Hitler, Stalin, Roosevelt, Churchill or some other... This is the idealist
personification of history which obscures the real, open, anti-proletarian
significance of all wars, whether they are anti-fascist, "for national
liberation", "for the defence of socialism" or some other anti-human justification.
<p>The end of the war therefore came to be a field of extraordinary experiments
for the bourgeoisie. They applied a number of lessons learnt from the preceding
struggles undertaken against the proletariat. More precisely, it was so
as to prevent the renewal of the revolutionary situation which had marked
Germany at the end of the so-called "First World War" (1914-18), it was
to preventatively suppress any proletarian uprising, that the bourgeoisie
came to orient its activity around three principal axes in 1945:
<ul>
<li>
Liquidating the proletarians able to constitute a threat and thus physically
crush any attempt at proletarian resistance in the cities;</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
in this sense to completely invade Germany and occupy it militarily using
the Allied armies charged with upholding order; the German government is
dissolved, the Allied armies enter Berlin;</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
maintain outside Germany for several months, even several years, the imprisoned
soldiers (interned on a massive scale) so as to avoid reproducing the upsets
of November 1918; clearly the prospect of demobilised "German" soldiers
returning to their destroyed homes made an impression on the world bourgeoisie
to the point that not only did they send hundreds of thousands of these
soldiers into the Soviet Gulag, but they also interned more than 400,000,
some of them in Britain up until 1948! Others were sent to camps in France,
in Belgium, or on the other side of the Atlantic, to the USA (7).</li>

The proletariat, as we affirm in our thesis No.26 (see: "Theses of Programmatic
Orientation") has only one war to call for and to undertake: the social
war against the whole of the bourgeoisie.
<blockquote><i>"<b>Workers have no homeland</b>, one cannot take away from
them what doesn't belong to them. Any form of defence of the nation, under
whatever pretext is an attack on the worldwide working class. Under the
reign of the bourgeoisie, all wars are <b>imperialist wars</b> with two
or more opposing factions or groups whose interests are world capital.
Proletariat wages and claims only one war: social war against the whole
bourgeoisie. Independently of the direct intentions of the protagonists,
the essential role of wars is to affirm Capital and to smash objectively
and subjectively the subversive class within this society. In this sense,
wars are never merely wars between National States, between the forces
of "national liberation" and the "imperialist" forces, or wars between
"imperialists", they are essentially <b>wars of Capital against communism.</b></i></blockquote>

<blockquote><i>Against all interbourgeois antagonisms between "progressive"
and "reactionary" factions, "fascist" and "anti-fascist" factions, "left
wing" and "right wing" factions,... the logical continuity of which are
imperialist wars, the proletariat has no other solution but the intransigent
struggle for its own class interests against all sacrifices, against all
truce, all national solidarity: <b>revolutionary defeatism</b>, turning
its weapons against its "own" direct exploiters, against its "own" direct
oppressors. The proletariat's aim is to transform through the international
centralisation of this community of struggle against Capital) capitalist
war into a revolutionary war of the world proletariat against the world
bourgeoisie."</i></blockquote>
It is this long thesis that we are reaffirming in conclusion of this text
by recalling that, from Dresden to Rotterdam, from Hiroshima to London,
from Stalingrad to Warsaw, the only "Victory" which mattered in 1945 was,
definitively, that of the bourgeoisie. In 1945 capitalist exploitation
was able to endure on the basis of the crushing of the proletariat. A moment
of the perpetuation of this defeat was concentrated in the credit accorded
to the "Allied", "anti-fascist" crimes, under cover of the publicity given
only to the crimes of the other camp. It is good to remember that: <b>fascist
or anti-fascist, the dictatorship of Capital is democracy.</b>
<p>We call on our readers not to remain passive but to struggle with us
against the amnesia with which the bourgeoisie attack us. We ask them not
only to criticise this text, but also to make material available to us
which allows us to better understand the history of our class and its struggle
in the years 1939-45. We shall return to all this in succeeding issues.
<h3>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">Notes</font></u></h3>
1. If we distance ourselves from the dominant terminology concerning this
question, it is because for us the years 1789-1793 were essentially <b>revolutionary</b>
years from the point of view of the affirmation of the <b>proletariat</b>
as a revolutionary class. Where official History heaps praise on the coming
of the Enlightened bourgeoisie, we can find recuperation, the diversion
of a proletarian struggle to the benefit of the reinforcement of the capitalist
mode of production, whose revolution didn't take place in 1789 but throughout
the XIVth, XVth and XVIth centuries, through the generalisation of the
world market. We will return to this question shortly - we are already
circulating a series of theses within our group.
<p>2. We consider as definitive that <b>the only real enemy of fascism</b>,
or of any other Bonapartist attempt put in place by the bourgeoisie to
crush our class, <b>is the revolutionary proletariat.</b> But the revolutionary
struggle against fascism cannot be separated from the struggle against
all the other fractions of the bourgeoisie, including those claiming to
be anti-fascist, who show nothing more than a desire to maintain capitalist
exploitation under another form and under the dictatorship of other managers.
In this sense, "anti-fascism", proclaimed by these factions, is most of
the time <b>only the facade of anti-fascism which only makes use of this
terminology from opportunism with the aim of more easily confronting a
capitalist competitor.</b> Its "anti-fascism" is a banner under which it
is occasionally easier to regroup its forces for its war. We only have
to recall that Stalin started off choosing an alliance with Hitler and
fascism, before taking up an alliance with Churchill and Roosevelt. The
bourgeoisie is no more the enemy of fascism than any other form of capitalist
management: the proletariat constitutes the only real grave-digger of the
capitalist dictatorship, whether its attire is fascist, anti-fascist, popular,
republican, anti-imperialist or Bonapartist.
<p>3. This quotation is taken from the book by David Irving,
<i>"The Destruction
of Dresden"</i>, PAPERMAC, 1985.
<p>4. See our text "War or Revolution" in <i>Communism</i> No.7, April
1992.
<p>5. For a more important development of the question, we refer our readers
to our texts "Capital: totalit&eacute; et guerre imp&eacute;rialiste" in
Communisme No.33, May 1991, and <i>"Contre la guerre imp&eacute;rialiste:
la r&eacute;volution communiste mondiale"</i> published in our central
review then called <i>Le Communiste</i> No.14, July 1982.
<p>6. We can recall, as we have already done in our review
<i>Communisme</i>
No.41 of December 1994 (<i>"Nous soulignons: '50 ans de paix... cela se
f&ecirc;te!'"</i>) that the important class struggles developed not only
- as is better known - in Northern Italy ((43-45) and in Greece, but also
in Germany, in Belgium, in France, in Yugoslavia, even in Russia. And as
if by chance, while the concentrations of workers in places such as Milan,
Turin and Rome had never been bombed during the war, it was when Italy
fell into the Allied camp, and particularly during the outbreak of strikes,
that the Allied air forces felt the necessity to bomb these regions, to
restore social peace through terror.
<p>7. Is it really necessary to point out here that we are talking about
measures only taken against proletarians? As for the generals, the Nazi
officers, the industrialists, the scientists... apart from some odd scumbags
who were liquidated during the great spectacle of the Nuremburg trials,
most of the German bourgeoisie would be promoted to high positions in the
opposing camp (scientists like Von Braun, for example), would be imprisoned
for a while (which would in any case be less unpleasant than being subjected
to forced labour like most of the soldiers), then released to set out on
a capitalist career in the "new" Germany. So, when H. M. Schleyer was executed
by the Red Army Faction, we learned that this boss of German bosses had
in fact been an old Nazi dignitary.

<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">But how was such a massacre explained at
the time?</font></u></h3>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Reading <i>Le Soir</i>, the big official Belgian
daily paper, is edifying. The information about the bombing of Dresden
was given two days later, in a little box coincidentally between the obituaries
and the list of the day's shows. There we can read that 1,400 RAF bombers
have attacked Dresden with the petrol refinery of Bohlen as their target
(we should recall that this refinery remained intact). On the first page
there's not a single trace of the 250,000 dead of Dresden. They are crushed
under information about... the Yalta peace agreements. A little lower down,
by contrast, a little commentary concludes: <i>"also it is only by the
brutal force of arms that they will finish off that race of fanatics"!</i>
The demonisation of the enemy and the discourse of peace. On one side,
purely and simply covering up the crimes of the victors, on the other side:
the methods of disinformation of the "Allies" hardly differ from those
of the "Nazis", no more than the methods still used today to justify the
Gulf War or to hide the attendant proletarian insurrections, for example.
In all cases the disinformation has the same function: to chain proletarians
to a nation and deny the identity of interests of the proletariat across
all frontiers and all nations.</font></td>

<font face="Comic Sans MS"><font color="#FF6666">Additional notes on the
bombing of Dresden</font></font></h1></center>
Following the publication of the article "Le capitalisme &agrave; l'oeuvre:
le bombardement de Dresde - f&eacute;vrier 1945" in <i>Communisme</i> No.42
(French), a reader sent us some additional information which we have published
below. This comrade's notes confirm what we stated in the article, illustrating
that there is nothing to choose between the atrocities of the so-called
anti-fascists and the fascists. Whenever it is a question of annihilating
masses of proletarians who are either of no use to the State or are a danger
to social peace, War and Science work together in perfect harmony. The
class in whose service they are working then shows its true face: barbarity.
Whatever democratic colours it wears -Nazi, stalinist, liberal... - bourgeoisie
always means torture.
<blockquote><i>"It is of greatest importance to fight against the lies
justifying the '39-'45 war, as stressed by the article on the bombing of
Dresden. However, it seemed to me that the article had omitted certain
details which could be very useful in showing that the barbarity was in
no way confined to one side.</i></blockquote>

<blockquote><i>The bomb attacks on Hamburg, Kassel, Darmstadt and Brunswick
had not been specifically designed to provoke storms of fire, which had
been an unexpected outcome of the bombing. However, in Dresden, firestorms
were the aim. This is evidenced by the choice of bombs and the way in which
they were used: explosive bombs were dropped first, smashing windows and
roofs and then incendiary bombs (which made up 75% of the bombs carried
by the first wave bombers), spreading fire throughout the whole city, which,
by then, had airstreams blowing violently across it.</i></blockquote>

<blockquote><i>The second wave aimed at destroying the rescue brigades
that were trying to save any that could be saved, the fire brigades trying
to put out the fire and the convoys of trucks bringing aid. The rescuers
were not only the target of the fighter-bombers, but of a whole wave of
bombers who had been given specific official orders to destroy them. The
fighters' official mission was to go in and `finish the job' after the
bombers had completed their attack.</i></blockquote>

<blockquote><i>(...) The Dresden-Klotzsche aerodrome (where hundreds of
planes remained firmly on the ground during the whole bombing) (...) was
totally spared by the bombers flying over it. Thus a military objective,
easily within reach of the bombers that were supposed to attack only military
targets, was left intact.</i></blockquote>

<blockquote><i>During the Nuremberg trial (and while denouncing the Nazies'
horrors), the US government (instigators of the trial) integrated some
Japanese scientists into their research teams on bacteriological and chemical
weapons. These scientists had already acted extremely ruthlessly in occupied
Chinese territory, carrying out experiments in their research units on
prisoners-of-war and on the Chinese population on a large scale. They had
tested the limits of human resistance to cold and heat, means of spreading
diseases amongst civilians (provoking a plague epidemic in the region of
Nankin by dropping containers full of contaminated fleas) and other similar
experiments. When Japan surrendered, the Americans (who were lagging behind
Russia in the field of bacteriological and chemical warfare research) camouflaged
their rehabilitation of these criminals by sacrificing their Nazi alter-egos,
who were less advanced in such research. Therefore, the Nazi scientists
were not made to pay for the horror of the experiments they carried out,
but for the fact that they had failed to produce enough results!"</i></blockquote>

examples of the <i>PROGRESS </i>of the capitalist State</font></font></font></h1></center>

<center>
<h1>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">* <font size=+4>*</font> *</font></h1></center>
The positivist ideology of progress, inherent to social-democracy and more
generally to the whole of bourgeois leftism, always leads to support for
capitalist progress. In opposition to this vision, we have always demonstrated
the total antagonism between our interests and the progress of capitalism
and of the State.
<p>From capital's point of view, the colonisation of America represented
extraordinary progress, as did the generalisation of slavery. The same
goes for the war economy, the accumulation of value, technological development
and the militarisation and effective control of the population. The World
Wars, or more recently the Vietnam and Gulf wars, were yet further milestones
on the road of capitalist progress and barbarity.
<p>At the same time, the State - that is capital concentrated into a force
of oppression and domination - has also made much progress, such as the
generalisation of the vote, the massive development of prisons, police
control of whole populations, the unionisation of the working class, the
widespread obligation to carry an I.D. card and the scientific analysis
of fingerprints... In the same way, the State has reinforced its role not
only by deepening the historical separation between producers and their
means of production - so that every being depends on the sale of his labour
force, to an ever-increasing extent - but also by controlling and officialising
a large number of activities that were previously performed in a particular
way. The progress of capital and the State cannot be summarised by the
fact that the inhabitants of the tropics today consume Coca-Cola rather
than coconut milk or that they eat rice rather than fish: that the common
run of people give birth in hospital, are forced to register their children,
feel obliged to have a church or a civil wedding and can no longer even
bring up their own children as, in order to be able to go to work, they
have to leave them in a nursery.
<p>All these types of progress have a mutual influence on each other. The
more capital develops, the more it opposes humanity and the more necessary
oppression and dictatorship become. Throughout antiquitity there has never
been any king, any tyrant who had such vast control over his subjects or
such an enormous repressive apparatus as does any "small" State today (1).
To believe that modern society could ever manage with less police or less
prisons, or that one day everyone might work of their own free will, is
an incredible delusion that has been refuted by reality a thousand times
over. On the contrary, the more this society of exploitation and oppression
progresses, the more indispensable direct mechanisms of repression and
oppression become to maintain humanity as a labour force for capital.
<p>Slavery was never wiped out, but merely disguised. Forced labour has
been developed on the basis of other, more modern, mechanisms such as the
generalisation of wage labour, but without abandoning forced labour itself.
The big concentration camps organised by capital proved to have far greater
potential than was ever developed by the mode of production exclusively
based on slavery. Moreover, slavery itself (at the same time as wage labour)
continues to be a reality in this world, in all its modernity, in numerous
countries, including certain areas of the US (2) and in all prisons across
the world.
<p>The progress of capital is such that all prisons and every police force
in the world are no longer sufficient for its purposes. The more capital
progresses, the more its opulence and misery grow, the more its wastefulness
develops and even the most basic needs fail to be met... so the police,
courts and prisons become more and more indispensable.
<p>In this article we want to <b>highlight some remarkable advances made
more recently by capital and the State, which are clear confirmation of
what capital holds in store for us - more repression and barbarity - because
they represent appreciable progress in the usual mechanisms of repression.</b>
<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font color="#FF6666">1. Forced labour for
prisoners reinstated in the USA. When will the castration of delinquents
begin?</font></font></u></h2>
When the Clinton government came into office, it was announced that they
had budgeted for the recruitment of another 100 000 policemen. This is
the kind of news that should really shock humanity, yet merely produces
resignation; after all, it is only one small news item in the torrent we
are used to. When we state that in a country such as the USA (symbol of
human rights and free enterprise) forced labour has been officially instituted
and that they are planning to castrate sexual delinquents, we are likely
to be accused of lying, fabrication and subversive provocation and told
that such things no longer exist, that we are not in the Middle Ages. However,
such information is becoming more and more prevalent.
<p>For instance, according to the Ansa news agency: <i>"The state of Alabama
has reestablished the use of chains for its prisoners, reintroducing a
method that had not been used for over 30 years</i> (only!!!) <i>in the
US. The new prison chief, Ron Jones, declared that "to see the prisoners
in chains will make our young people think and will convince them that
crime does not pay!"</i>
<p>Even before the television screens of the whole world had transmitted
this sordid show of chained prisoners escorted by police and being submitted
to forced labour, the Ansa agency had reported: <i>"During the coming weeks,
400 prisoners will be forced to work on the roads and fields outside the
prison, and one will again witness the spectacle of prisoners being chained
together five by five, just like in some old films."</i>
<p>In another state of the USA, during the same period (February-April
95), fierce argument was raging as to whether those who had committed "serious
sexual crimes" should be castrated or not.
<p>In an international telegram dated March 29th 1995, Ansa reported: <i>"A
proposal to castrate those found guilty of serious sexual crimes provoked
fervent debate even before becoming law in the state of Texas. The bill,
approved by a large majority of the Senate of this state, offers such prisoners
the choice between castration or prison."</i>
<p>Senator Royce West (Democrats) became indignant, describing it as barbarity:
<i>"What
will be the next step? To cut off thieves' hands?"</i> And "why not?" we
ask. Are there not "other States" supported by these same capitalist factions
that practise precisely such methods? Do not torturers and killers in the
pay of the police across half of the planet receive instruction and training
from the same police forces that the Democrats and Republicans applaud
in the USA? And is the State that chops off hands in some parts of the
world not the same, in the end, as the one that is planning to cut off
balls in the US?
<p>Let's listen to the arguments of the republicans in Texas. This is what
the Republican Senator Teel Bivins had to say when referring to those who,
according to his judgment, should be castrated: <i>"Such persons often
fall victim of uncontrollable instincts, several have asked for surgery
voluntarily so as to put an end to their sexual appetite and start living
a normal life at last."</i>
<p>"A normal life" !!!? "A normal life" ???!!!
<p>We sincerely hope that the proletariat will not delay in inflicting,
in public, this kind of "normal life" on him!
<p>But let's return to his argument. Mr.Bivins maintains that this new
proposal will leave criminals the liberty to choose whether to be castrated
or not: <i>"The decision to amputate the testicles will be totally voluntary."</i>
As always, behind freedom of choice, lies the stick; and in this case,
moreover, blackmail. As far as the revolutionary proletariat is concerned,
it will not stoop to the level of blackmailing the honourable Mr.Bivins,
but will definitely not leave him the "right to choose"!
<p>Mr. Bivins adds further that he has <i>"carefully evaluated studies
on castration in certain European countries, which show that castration
enormously reduces the chances of repeating sexual crimes."</i>
<p>It is important to realise that this bill has <b>already been approved
by the Senate</b>, which shows to what extent this way of reasoning and
acting, more often attributed to the Middle Ages, is coming back into fashion,
corresponding to <b>increasingly modern and necessary forms of State oppression</b>,
not only to the barbarity of "Islamic States", as Western democrats are
fond of repeating.
<p>The Ansa news agency ends its report by commenting that for the bill
to become law it has to be approved by the Texan Lower Chamber, and then
signed by the Governor...
<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font color="#FF6666">2. Science and genetics
at the service of the police and State oppression</font></font></u></h2>
On the 10th of april 1995, the international press announced that from
that moment on, <i>"the British police will be equipped with the first
operational genetic file in the world dedicated to fighting crime and capable
of listing up to 5 million delinquants."</i>
<p>Even if this may be upsetting to many progressivists, we assert that
this constitutes major progress for capital, for State control of life,
an impressive development of the mechanisms of repression on which our
enemies can count from now on.
<blockquote><i>"The promoters of this project regard it to be the most
revolutionary tool at the disposal of the police since the introduction
of fingerprinting, nearly a century ago (3). The Home Office has welcomed
this exciting development that puts Britain at the forefront of the struggle
against crime."</i>
<p><i>"The file... is located in Birmingham (centre of England) and its
access is under strict security controls. It registers the DNA-code of
people who have already been convicted or of those simply questioned during
an investigation by analysing some saliva or a strand of hair."</i>
<p><i>"Since last year, the law has allowed such genetic samples to be
taken from all suspects, even without their agreement. The police's aim
is to put 135 000 British men and women on file in the first year, mainly
in cases of murder, sexual assault and violent robbery. Ultimately, 5 million
files will be stored, ie. 10% of the British population. Sixty full-time
police officers and scientists will be taken on to manage the files."</i></blockquote>
According to this news report, it will take only 7 days to compare the
information in the file with any evidence found at the scene of a crime
and to establish who's guilty (providing that person has already been put
on file). The margin of error will be less than one in several million.
The cost of such an operation, sample analysis and comparison with the
file, will be extremely cheap, around 65 dollars.
<p>Even the most appalling Orwellian predictions have become trivial compared
to the progress of this marvellous world we live in. Here are two more
examples of the progress made by the State in Great Britain.
<ul>
<li>
in the last few years, more than 1 million security cameras have been installed.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<li>
on the 10th of April 1995, the same day that the genetic file became operational,
a new provision of the penal code was approved, which scraps
<i>"... the
sacred right to remain silent, which is supposed to have benefitted all
those taken into custody. Henceforth, any refusal to answer police questions
will be held against the accused during a future trial."</i></li>
</blockquote>
During the same period, we realised, while reading Belgian newspapers,
that the English State is not as much at the avant-garde of repression
as we might have been led to believe. The newspaper <i>Le Soir</i> wrote:
<i>"In
Belgium, filing is also in full swing. After encoding fingerprints and
photographs of suspects and detainees, genetic fingerprints are being entered
into the National Institute of Criminology's (INC) computers. This is a
slow and progressive process that is being carried out under the watchful
eye of the December 1992 law concerning the protection of private life."</i>
All this comes complete with their guarantees for the protection of democratic
rights!
<p><i>Le Soir</i> continues: <i>"This filing is authorised by a royal decree
determining the INC's tasks. The computer system was installed recently
and about a month and a half ago they started to encode the results of
genetic reports provided by several official laboratories" ... "The genetic
fingerprints come from analysis of blood, sperm or human tissue samples
(skin, hair...). These allow a genetic fingerprint to be determined specific
to each individual and partially similar to one's parents. This technique
often used in cases of murder or rape, when it is possible to find some
sperm or blood originating from the presumed perpetrator. These samples
will allow, by way of the file, to establish a link with other cases in
which the accused's guilt has already been established. But only a magistrate
-the director of the file- will be allowedd access to make any link between
a print and a person.</i> (This is where they tell us that we don't need
to worry, that we are protected by law!) <i>This protection stems from
the law of 8.12.92 on the protection of private life. This law authorises
the constitution of files (the individual does not own the information
concerning him and cannot oppose it) but imposes some restrictions on files
allowing personal identification... Nevertheless, the law is more permissive
where judicial or administrative police enquiries are concerned."</i> (This
should come as no surprise to us!)
<p>And as if this wasn't enough, <i>Le Soir</i> also informs us that not
only judges and police are interested in the files, but bosses as well:
<i>"If
genetics can be useful to judges, it could be that it will soon be exploited...
by employers. Researchers from the School of the Sociology of Health at
the Universite Libre de Bruxelles (ULB), have started a study polling bosses
and unions in order to find out their opinion... Will bosses soon discard
a CV if a perfect health certificate does not accompany it?"</i>
<p>And we will still be told that it is not science itself that is bad,
but the way it is used to oppress; that we shouldn't challenge genetics
just because it is being used by the police. This point of view is common
to all "progressivists", as much to the bourgeois right as to Stalinism,
Trotskyism or more generally, the whole of social-democracy. This ideology
is just a particular application of a much more general conception that
considers productive forces to be neutral, at the service of either barbarity,
or humanity, according to who is using them and how they are being used.
<p>But what is forgotten in this conception, is that it is capital that
conceives the productive forces; the rate of profit determines what science
researches or produces. It is not the neutrality of research <b>but the
market</b> that directs genetics or science; it is money that rules laboratories
and "inspires" scientists, it is subsidy, and therefore the central State
apparatus, that have the last word in what type of research is to be undertaken.
And so the cycle is completed: not only does the police use science, but
science itself is entirely conceived as an <b>agent of the State</b>, as
a police department.
<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font color="#FF6666">3. Neuroleptics against
the homeless</font></font></u></h2>
<i>"When the slums revolt, bullets will not stop them."</i> This is a basic
axiom of the politics of bourgeois domination. Velasco Alvaro, the ex-military
president of Peru used this argument to explain to his colleagues the absolute
necessity for his progressive coup d'&eacute;tat, and to argue that it
is necessary to change many things in order to keep everything in its place.
<p>And since bullets are not enough, they use other means: progress of
course, but also the drug mafia, religious sects, new social services,...
This is how, following the wave of struggle of 1989, they set up police
stations and aid centres in different areas of Caracas to control the population,
to detect and chanel sources of rebellion and more generally, to get the
population used to repression. In the same way, all over the world, children
are put into files starting from school, even from nursery school. In these
institutions, different kind of social assistants operate: it is their
job to investigate and, in general, are efficient agents for prevention
and policing on behalf of the State. Lately, we have learned that in different
countries of Latin and non-Latin America (and we presume that it is the
same on other continents), humanitarian organisations, always so preoccupied
with health problems, are freely distributing Valium and other diazepam-derived
hypnotics in the hospitals they set up or run. Even worse, in certain shanty-towns
more than half the population are dependent upon these hard drugs... and
comrades who live in these areas consider this to be one of the main causes
for the general mood of passivity.
<p>But one cannot stop progress! All of this is no longer sufficient. In
the US they are preparing a law to make the use of neuroleptics (4) compulsory
for the "homeless".
<p>In concrete terms, Senator Nancy Kassebaum, elected by the State of
Kansas and president of the Labour and Human Resources Committee, has worked
out a draft law that, according to David Oaks (5), proposes "to apply the
status of IOC ("Involuntary Outpatient Commitment") to the homeless". This
report explains that the IOC are patients allowed to leave psychiatric
hospital on the condition that they attend on a regular basis to be given
injections of neuroleptics that keep them permanently drugged.
<blockquote><i>"I.O.C now exists in more than half of the U.S. States.
It usually amounts to this: people living out of their community, not at
that time violating any law or hurting anyone, must report regularly to
their community mental health facility for injections of long-acting neuroleptic
drugs, such as Haldol or Proxilin. They can be locked up simply for refusing
this chemical. The effect of this "depot injection" in the butt lasts weeks!
... When your name comes up on the computer, and you didn't report for
your injection, sometimes a "mobile aggressive treatment team" is sent
out to find you and inject you on the spot. These goon squads are known
by some on the streets as "needles on wheels".....Pharmaceutical fundamentalists
have embarked on a chemical crusade to forcibly inject us -especially homeless
Americans- with powerful neurotoxins, sometimes for life, wasting taxpayer
millions to create dependent people... our country is on the brink of accepting
a Brave New World "final solution" to poverty."</i></blockquote>
The same organisation DENDRITE denounces a collection of "side effects"
of such drugs:
<ul>
<li>
Neuroleptics can kill because one of their main effects is to prevent the
loss of body heat. This could partly explain "deaths due to the heat" as
reported in the press. Recently, during each heat wave, hospitals have
been full and many people have died, with the heat being the only explanation
given! The main reason is clearly related to pollution which, in the absence
of rain and wind, combined with high CO2 emissions, produces a high concentration
of ozone detrimental, in particular, to those with respiratory problems
(asthma, allergies,...) (6).</li>
</ul>

<ul>But it is clear that the use of neuroleptics is an additional lethal
factor hidden amongst the figures of those who die because of the "heat"!
(Do they really think we will believe this bullshit?). Referring to the
last heatwave, David Oaks said:
<blockquote><i>"The following item was in today's newspaper, 19th July
1995, via the Associated Press of Chicago, concerning the heatwave just
experienced by much of the USA: "In Milwaukee, officials said the heatwave
caused or contributed to 60 deaths. Among them were about 18 people who
were taking anti-psychotic drugs which block the body's ability to release
heat, said Medical Expert Jeffrey Jentzen. "Before seeing this, just yesterday,
I had posted some letters giving seven arguments against forced "outpatient"
psychiatric drugging (Involuntary Outpatient Commitment or I.O.C.). The
first argument I gave was that during heatwaves, forced neuroleptics can
kill..."</i></blockquote>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<i>"...neuroleptics can also kill and damage in many other ways... such
as heart attacks, brain damage in long-term users, including measurable
brain shrinkage."</i></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
It has been proven that <i>"long-term use of neuroleptics can induce a
permanent "rebound effect"... neuroleptics can produce more of the distress
the drugs are meant to suppress."</i></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
Certain associations of <i>"'Survivors' of forced neuroleptic treatment
call it "torture"... those who do not want to take neuroleptics often describe
the drug as feeling like a lobotomy... the areas affected in the brain
are the frontal lobes, as is the case in lobotomy."</i></li>
</ul>
What we have exposed here are just a few <b>examples</b> of the present
development of mechanisms of repression. News of this kind emerges on a
daily basis. We heard recently that, from now on, begging will be banned
in some French towns as well as in Brussels, the capital of Europe, and
all beggars will be expelled; in Europe's psychiatric hospitals, staff
are being replaced by cameras; in France, under the pretext of anti-terrorism,
bags, parcels etc, can be searched at any time on buses and in the underground.
"Big Brother", and all the macabre system Orwell described in his novel
"1984" look pathetic compared to reality. <b>In any case, this is the best
world that capitalism's progress and its State has to offer us.</b> Yet
these examples relate to what they call "peacetime"... in other periods,
it is far worse!

We cannot respond to every provocation, insult and slander aimed at our
comrades throughout the world by organisations such as ICC, but there are
excesses and methods that we are forced to denounce as being against the
proletariat.
<p>The ICC has never split from social-democratic and pacifist conceptions,
nor ceased to assert its europeist and euroracist conception of the world.
In concrete terms, it specializes in denigrating proletarian struggles
in the Middle-East (1), America, Africa, whilst vindicating many strikes
and pacifist demonstrations (usually trade unionist) that take place in
Western Europe, especially in France (2).
<p>Wherever the place, the ICC always knows which side to choose. In Europe,
it opposes every attempt at class rupture and denounces all violent action
by the proletariat, labelling it as provocation. Everywhere else, armed
with this good old eurocentrist social-democratic ideology, it denies the
class character of the revolutionary social movement, as well as the class
groups defending it.
<center>
<h2>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">oOo</font></h2></center>
Not long ago, comrades of the "Collectif Pour la D&eacute;fense du Communisme"
(Collective for the Defence of Communism) sent us a denunciation of the
social-democratic and "lambertist" character of the ICC ("social-democratic
shit"), along with the quotations upon which they based their statements,
taken from the periodical published by the ICC in France. In it, the ICC
labels all those who went on to direct action in the struggle of March
1994 as being <b>agents provocateurs in the police's pay.</b> We present
here some howlers made by these lackeys of the bourgeois State, selected
by comrades of the CDC. They take on their full relevence when it is taken
into account that the violent actions denounced by the ICC were rare exceptions,
counter-current to the general atmosphere of social peace reigning in France
at that time.
<blockquote><i>"It is obvious that the first brawls, if not directly fomented
by the police, were widely furthered by them..."</i>
<p><i>"Furthermore, these provocations were a good way for the bourgeoisie
to seek to intimidate the workers by the deployment of its repressive arsenal,
to make them believe that they had no way of imposing a balance of power
to their own advantage in the face of the State..."</i>
<p><i>"As for the "explosive actions" based on terrorism, not only have
they nothing to do with the proletarian struggle, but they feature increasingly
in the methods used by the bourgeoisie to perpetuate its class terror.
At best, they represent desperate reactions of the rebellious petite bourgeoisie
without a future and, at worse (in most cases), actions by small groups
manipulated by the State and its secret services..."</i></blockquote>
Note that this is exactly the same argument used by social-democracy against
proletarian groups all over the world, identical to that used by opportunists
and reformists against all those who won the revolutionary autonomy of
the proletariat on the streets in 1917-23. Those who opt for direct action
and do not accept social peace are accused of serving the enemy and giving
the bourgeoisie a pretext to harden State terror. As if repression ever
needed a pretext!
<p>The comrades of the Collectif conclude that <i>"a time will come when
those who write such things will have to take cover"</i>... and they are
right!
<p>Let's remember that these are the same social-democratic arguments used
by Domingo Arango and others such as Abad de Santillan against the violent
actions of revolutionary militants such as Di Giovani or Rocigna in Argentina
in the 20's. This sort of slander, <b>its usefulness for the State very
real in this instance</b>, led to Domingo Arango receiving a bullet in
the head, and we can only lament that Abad de Santillan did not share the
same fate. He went on, in Spain in '36-'37, to play a leading role in the
liquidation and republican disarmament of the proletariat following its
triumph in the insurrection.

<h2>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">oOo</font></h2></center>
In <i>Revoluc&iacute;on Mundial</i> No.21, the Mexican version of the ICC
dedicates a text of insults and slander to us entitled <i>"The ICG and
its support for the 'Zapatist movement'"</i>, one step further towards
the relinquishment of proletarian positions".
<p>As we said previously, we cannot stop at each falsification and every
lie, but will denounce the general method of falsification. As an example,
throughout the whole of their article the writers make out that they are
quoting from our texts by putting half-sentences in quotation marks when,
in reality, <b>they are constructions of the ICC's mind</b>, which bear
no relation to our assertions.
<p>Starting with the title itself: <i>"The ICG and its support for the
'Zapatist movement'"</i>. Our group has never supported any "Zapatist movement"
but rather the movement of the <b>proletariat</b> against the bourgeoisie
in Mexico.
<p>Another example: <i>"There is its 'critical' support for Shining Path
in Peru"</i>. Here, in addition to a perfect falsification, we find a true
<b>collaboration
with the policy of amalgam carried out by the police.</b> We have never
formulated any critical or non-critical support for Shining Path. We globally
denounced the group as a danger to the autonomy of the proletariat in the
region. Furthermore, we consider its positions on the peasants' war and
the fight for democracy to be counterrevolutionary and doomed to deadlock.
What we have done, and will continue to do, is support the struggle of
the proletariat in Peru, including the struggle of proletarian prisoners,
even if some, or even a large number of them, carry the flag of Shining
Path.
<p>And while this bunch of bastards that constitute the ICC were declaring
that there were no proletarian "political prisoners" in Latin America,
we were fighting to free imprisoned proletarians. The ICC remained indifferent
-and therefore became accomplices- to the  huge massacre of proletarian
prisoners orchestrated by social democracy in Peru, under the pretext that
they belonged to one or other organization, whilst our group openly defined
itself as being on the side of the prisoners and called for the denunciation
of the massacre and for international proletarian struggle (3). In reality,
for the ICC as for the bourgeois State, and in particular for the Peruvian
police, to stand on the side of the oppressed is to support Shining Path.
That is infact the basis of the whole police strategy in Peru, which consists
of repressing anybody by accusing him or her of collaborating with or supporting
Shining Path. It's precisely on the basis of this amalgam that many comrades
(internationalist or self-defined anarchist) are repressed. As we said
at the time:
<blockquote><b><i>"Anyway, we believe that to fail to show solidarity with
those repressed, on the pretext that they are Stalinists, Maoists or other,
is to become accomplices of the State and the whole international press
which identifies Shining Path and its ideology with the proletariat crushed
in blood in Peru today."</i></b></blockquote>
But clearly taking sides with the proletariat by confronting and denouncing
State terrorism has nothing to do with the critical support of this or
that formal organization, in the same way that, for example, support for
the proletarian revolution in Russia must not be amalgamated with support
for the policies of the formal Bolshevik organization. Moreover, the latter
did not demarcate itself from the terrain of left-wing social-democracy,
which is why it oscillated between insurrection and support for democratic
bourgeois government, between direct action and parliamentarism, between
confrontation with Capital and the economic policies for its development
(strengthening of "State capitalism", taylorism, NEP,...). In the workers'
camp, we have always considered those who contribute to this type of police
amalgam to be cops and informers, including those who "confuse" determined
direct action against the State with whichever formal organization that
is in hiding and being hounded by the police. As can be seen from the example
of the policies of the State in Italy over recent years, this policy of
amalgam is fundamental to State repression.
<p>Throughout ICC's article the passages in quotations marks are supposed
to contitute statements made by our group, <b>but are actually nothing
but lies and slander.</b> Thus, we learn that the ICG presents itself as
the <i>"continuator of the Bordigist tradition"</i> (ICC's quotations marks!).
If you were to read the thousands of pages we have written in all our published
languages, you would never come across any such absurdity. This is pure
ideology from the ICC. Neither our group, nor Bilan, nor Prometeo,... have
ever presented themselves as Bordigists and even less as continuators of
the Bordiguist tradition. The same applies when they quote us as calling
for the <i>"Mexican revolution"</i> or that we consider that <i>"the movement
of Emiliano Zapata was influenced by the proletariat"</i>. The ICC is just
spouting loads of bullshit whose only basis is its own social-democratic
ideology which makes a distinction between the "peasants" and the "proletariat";
this has definitely nothing to do with our positions.
<p>What is important in all this is not to denounce particular insults
aimed at us, but to disclose the methods used by the counterrevolution:
inaccurate quotations, falsifications, amalgams,... As if it were a trial,
the aim is to discredit us and, if possible, hand us over to the cops.
<center>
<h2>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">oOo</font></h2></center>
What lies behind all these dirty tricks, this jealous policy of lies and
slander? Disparagement and falsification of the struggle of our class,...
We quote, word for word:
<blockquote><i>"What are the 'majority of the proletariat in arms'? A handful
of peasants whose desperate misery served the purposes of the organizers
of this movement" ... "a few peasants who dream of a kind of autonomy for
ethnic groups, who do not look for the abolition of private property, but
for the 'restitution of land'... in fact, their aim doesn't go further
than the established order, they long for nothing else but to 'make exploitation
more humane and fair'"</i></blockquote>
Note that they haven't recovered from their mania of putting statements
of their own in quotation marks and attributing them to their opponents
(the proletarians in Mexico). Note particularly the vulgar manoeuvre in
which they put the words "make exploitation more human and fair" in quotation
marks, as if their contradictors had actually declared a such thing, thus
disparaging the struggle of the proletariat by inventing sentences that
only they assert!
<p>As is commonplace in social-democracy, they discredit the proletariat,
try to divide it, label proletarians as peasants simply because they live
in the countryside and, similarly, if they live in towns, try to dissolve
them into townsmen, citizens. Indeed, the ICC knows as well as everybody
that this is not a question of the <i>"small-holding (Parzellen) peasants"</i>
referred to by Marx in <i>"The 18th Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte"</i>, not
a question of small landowners but, on the contrary, of agricultural workers
dispossessed of everything (4), proletarians who have nothing to sell but
their labour force and whose only possessions are their "proles" (that
is to say, their descendants) and whom, as such, <b>are objectively opposed
to the world of private property.</b> In our opinion, this opposition does
not arise from any particular idea, expression or ideological declaration
but, on the contrary, from the life of the proletarians itself, from their
total deprivation of the means of survival, from the only class whose social
and material existence opposes private ownership of the means of life (and
production). Attributing any objectives other than social revolution to
proletarians (whether agricultural or not) is purely and simply <b>taking
sides with the counterrevolution, just as social-democracy has always done.</b>
<p>By attributing different interests from the rest of the proletariat
to those who are dying of starvation, the ICC are making the same assertions
that have always been made by the counter-revolution. Whilst the Maderos,
the Carranzas,... social-democracy, the ICC in Mexico and the EZLN have
designated reform and the defence of private property as being the aim
of the agricultural proletariat in that country, revolutionaries of the
past and of always, from Zalacosta to Julio Chavez Lopez, from Librado
Rivera to Flores Magon... to the revolutionaries of today have their objectives
firmly set on the <b>abolition of private property and the destruction
of the State.</b>
<center>
<h2>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">oOo</font></h2></center>
But there is more. In accordance with its social-democratic line, the ICC
goes further; it was not enough for them to denigrate the struggle of the
proletariat today and they have gone on to assert that the struggle of
the proletariat between 1910 and 1920 was not a proletarian struggle either.
Yes, however incredible it may seem, the ICC does not grant even the tiniest
certificate of proletarian struggle to this <b>gigantic revolutionary wave
of proletariat against bourgeoisie in Mexico which marked the beginning
of the whole worldwide wave of struggles.</b> Even worse, it asserts that
it was a struggle between imperialist forces. We quote word for word (translated
into English):
<blockquote><i>"The war in Mexico from 1910 to 1920 was not in the first
instance a proletarian revolution. The young and dispersed industrial proletariat
(5) did not constitute a decisive force during the war. In fact, its most
important attempts at rebellion, the wave of strikes at the beginning of
the century, had been completely crushed on the eve of war. In as far as
certain proletarian sectors did participate in the war, they did so as
carriages pulled along behind bourgeois fractions. As for the agricultural
proletariat, without his industrial brother as a guide and still very attached
to the land, he remained very integrated in peasant war... But what is
called the 'Mexican revolution' has not exhausted its content in internal
social conflict. It also remains fully within the framework of the imperialist
conflicts which shook the world at the beginning of the century and which
led on to the First World War... and to a change in the hegemony of the
major powers." (6)</i></blockquote>
As soon as the proletariat goes from a wave of strikes to armed struggle,
severs the bourgeoisie's head and expropriates, social-democracy can no
longer hide its repugnance and refuses to grant it the certificate of proletarian
struggle, accusing it of being <i>"terrorist"</i> etc.
<p>In our eyes it is normal that the ICC does not recognise the revolutionary
character of the proletariat's struggle and we have nothing more to add
to the basis of this question. We will leave it to the texts we have presented,
and continue to present, on revolution and counter-revolution in Mexico.
Eighty
years ago, the comrade Flores Magon replied to these <b>same slanders</b>,
putting their authors in the place they deserved. At that time, social-democracy
and the sectors of social-democratic "anarchism" (such as Grave or Galleani)
also denied the proletarian, the communist character of these struggles;
but in this period also, <b>the barricade only had two sides: either the
side of the proletariat and its struggle or against it.</b>
<blockquote><b><i>"Who are those who doubt that there is a revolutionary
movement in Mexico, and that this movement has the immediate aim, not to
bring a new president into power, but to appropriate the land and the machinery
of production?</i></b>
<p><b><i>Just a few rascals who by their silence or their attacks, help
the bourgeoisie and authority, taking the moral and material force away
from those who rose up in arms brandishing the Red Flag of the worldwide
proletariat."</i></b>
<p><b>Ricardo Flores Magon</b>
<br><b>in <i>"Class War"</i></b>
<br><b><i>Regeneracion</i>, 6th April 1912</b></blockquote>
As for the reactionary invention which consists of saying that this struggle
was within the framework of imperialist war, we can only add that only
<b>those
who confuse revolution with counter-revolution</b> could make such an assertion,
because it was only when the counter-revolution had triumphed, when the
extraordinary revolutionary movement of our comrades had been liquidated,
that the proletariat was transformed into cannon fodder for the interbourgeois
war. And this is not particular to Mexico. In all other major revolutionary
attempts of this century, as in Russia, Germany or, later still in Spain,
it was only once counter-revolution had triumphed (whether under the flag
of the revolution or not) that they managed to mobilise the workers as
the people and make cannon fodder out of them for the various bourgeois
fractions who were fighting over the leadership of the State, culminating
in the gigantic imperialist butchery which public opinion and its ideological
defenders still insist on calling the "second world war".
<p>Over and above the denunciation of this social-democratic organisation,
what interests us is to expose the methodology, the essence of the reasoning
behind it.
<p>As was exposed by Marx and the comrade Flores Magon (see our revue in
Spanish, <i>Comunismo</i> No.35), proletarian revolt is born from the needs
of the proletariat. In the same way, the socialist and communist content
of its struggle lies within its very life, within its opposition, which
is international and, as it were, pre-conscious of capital. Formal communist,
revolutionary programmes do not emanate from any particular individual,
but are contained within this reality. This does not in any way signify
a denial of the importance of clarifying the movement and therefore organisational,
conscious and disciplined action, the party's revolutionary action, in
the struggle for communist society.
<p>For social-democracy it is quite the opposite. As was developed by Kautsky,
Lenin and many others, the workers do not fight for their historical interests,
but exlusively for their immediate ones. According to them, socialism,
or the ideas of socialism, must come from outside the class.
<p>Here follows the famous explanation by Kautsky on the socialist consciousness
which comes from the exterior:
<blockquote><i>"...But socialism and the class struggle arise in parallel
and do not engender each other: they arise from different premises. Today's
socialist consciousness can only arise on the basis of deep scientific
knowledge. In fact, contemporary economic science is as much a condition
of socialist production as is, for example, modern technology and, despite
all its wishes, the proletariat cannot create either one or the other:
both of them arise out of the contemporary social process. Thus, the bearer
of science is not the proletariat, but <b>bourgeois intellectuals</b></i>
(underlined by Karl Kautsky)<i>: contemporary socialism was, in effect,
born from the brains of certain individuals of that category and was communicated
by them to the most intellectually evolved proletarians, who went on to
introduce it into the class struggle of the proletariat where conditions
allowed it. In this way, therefore, socialist consciousness is an element
imported from the outside</i> (von Aussen Hineingetragenes) <i>into the
class struggle of the proletariat and not something that arises spontaneously.
Also the old programme of Heinfeld said very rightly that the task of social-democracy
is to introduce into the proletariat</i> (literally: to fill the proletariat
up with) the consciousness of its situation and the consciousness of its
mission."</blockquote>
This thesis is taken up by Kautsky's disciple Lenin, who brings this ideology
to its maximum expression in <i>"What is to be done?"</i>
<blockquote><i>"Social-democratic consciousness... could only come from
the outside. The history of all countries testifies that, by its own forces
alone, the working class can only reach trade-unionist consciousness...
As for socialist doctrine, this was born from philosophical, historical,
economic theories elaborated by representatives instructed by the owning
classes, by intellectuals."</i></blockquote>
Social-democracy, in the Mexican version of the ICC, goes even further
than this in this negation of the proletariat, its struggle, its objectives,
its consciousness. It adds all of its europeist racist ideology to its
basic Kautskist conception. For the ICC, socialism not only comes from
the outside of the proletariat, the outside of Mexico but, worse still,
it stems directly from the contributions of the white European race. On
page 16 of the Mexican review that we have been commenting on, in an article
on unions in Mexico, we found the following gem.
<blockquote><i>"Strikes were extremely rare before 1870, starting to generalise
from that decade onwards. This transformation was not a 'spontaneous' acquisition
of the proletariat that was born in Mexico; on the contrary, it was the
result of the influence of organisations which were developing in Europe."</i></blockquote>
That is to say, according to the ICC, not even the generalisation of strikes
(the need for which is felt during every strike) could arise in the struggle
of the Mexican proletariat. The poor Mexican workers are not even credited
with a brain to manage that... probably because they are Indians, because
they do not belong to the European white race!
<p>The Mexican version of the ICC explains it like this:
<blockquote><i>"In general, there was less knowledge about the development
of socialism in Mexico than in many other Latin American countries. It
emanated, almost in its entirety from the activities and writings of a
few workers and immigrant intellectuals; Nevertheless, immigration did
not play such a substantial role in the formation of the proletariat in
Mexico. In 1910 foreigners made up 59.4% in Argentina, 32.2% in Brasil,
whilst in Mexico they only reached 0.77%, of those only 4.2% being workers.
Added to this is the immaturity of the proletariat in Mexico which saw
to it that those who reappropriated the organisational experiences of the
European proletariat were rich artisans."</i></blockquote>
This is the ICC's version of the Kautsko-leninist theory of consciousness
coming from the outside: <b>for them, it doesn't just come from outside
the class, but from outside the country and is clearly a creation of the
European white race.</b>
<p>This is not just a negation of the fundamental basis of materialist
historical determinism, but much more globally communism as a universal
being, a human community in historical opposition to the community of commodities
and money. The historical arc of communism is ignored, the centuries and
centuries of struggle by exploited against exploiters, the struggle of
the human race against property, against value in process,... and to put
the icing on the cake, communism is reduced to an ideology paticularly
invented in Europe. One can therefore see perfectly, even if it is sometimes
possible to think the opposite, that social-democracy does not go beyond
the judeo-christian conception of the world.
<p>So let's leave Kautsky's modern emulators here. We have no more space
to mention dozens of examples of practical, historical ways in which the
proletariat in Mexico, in its own struggle, opposed bourgeois society and
asserted its revolutionary, communist character, not only since 1910, but
well before. In any case, our class's revolutionary struggle has never
waited for the ICC to come with its ideological wild imaginings in order
to develop. Our class has no need to undertake theoretical investigations,
to import ideas to fight for its needs, for communist revolution and to
finish off its enemies.
<p>As Marx said in <i>"The Class Struggles in France"</i>:
<blockquote><b><i>"As soon as it has risen up, a class in which the revolutionary
interests of society are concentrated finds the content and the material
for its revolutionary activity directly in its own situation: foes to be
laid low, measures dictated by the needs of the struggle to be taken; the
consequences of its own deeds to drive it on. It makes no theoretical inquiries
into its own task."</i></b></blockquote>

<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">Notes</font></u></h3>
1. The ICC didn't feel the slightest bit ashamed to state that <i>"the
working class is a minority in Iraq... and possesses almost no historical
experience of combat against capital"</i>... at the very moment that workers'
insurrection broke out there!
<p>2. During the recent movement of struggle in November/December '95,
the ICC suddenly took an opposite course to this position (without departing
from its everlasting attitude of truncating reality to make it conform
it to their own positions). So, without, of course, ever referring to the
few violent ruptures expressed in this movement, the working class (as
seen by the ICC), up until yesterday guardian of class consciousness, suddenly
became a simple mass of trade union manoeuvres, incapable of affirming
its class interests. This reversed unilateral position probably resulted
from an nth modification of its biased ideology, decided during an nth
general congress. Disgusting egocentrism!
<p>3. On this topic, see our article "Large-scale massacre of prisoners
in Peru" in <i>Communism</i> No.6.
<p>4. Besides, on the American continent, where capitalism was despotically
imposed by the conquest and where feudalism never existed, the <i>"small-holding
peasants"</i>, the petit bourgeois, never existed as a force and never
played an important role. In North, South and Central America the class
polarisation (bourgeoisie/proletariat) has always been the unique reality.
The large masses in the countryside do not possess any property (and when,
exceptionally, they own property on a legally formal basis, it is only
a trick, any real economic property remaining absent). They are part of
the <b>proletariat</b> in the sense that revolutionaries have always given
to this word. The search for <i>"small-holding peasants"</i> by sociologists
and bourgeois left-wing militants in America clearly shows their cultural
alienation, making them apply the European model of passing
<i>"from feudalism
to capitalism"</i> in a mechanical way. It is not by chance that those
who talk about the existence of peasants in America also talk about feudal
society or feudal reminiscence and the need for bourgeois democratic revolution.
<p>5. We do not want to enter into comparisons between countries, as this
is not our terrain but, given that it constitutes the basis of the whole
ideology of the ICC (see their emphasis on this question in what follows)
we will at least say that this description is completely wrong. The "industrial"
sector of the proletariat in Mexico in the last century is comparable in
terms of quantity and concentration with that of continental Europe in
the same period and, more important, in terms of struggle, associationism,
strikes (since 1850 in Tarel, Guadalajara), programmes, communist organisations
(the first Communist Party that we know by this name was founded in Mexico
in 1878) was one of the most precocious sectors of the proletariat in the
world. Put simply, arguments of the supposed weakness of the proletariat
have always been used by the counter-revolution.

In this article, we want to highlight the new step taken by the State in
Italy in its repression of groups of proletarian militants. We denounce
the action of the State and want to show solidarity with comrades hit by
this repression. We also call for struggle and solidarity against this
recent warlike aggression by worldwide State terrorism.
<p>Italy, major laboratory of counterrevolution, model of repression, international
"example" of the technique of amalgam, factory of repentant and dissociated
people, of collaborateurs... has made a further qualitative step.
<p>A few years ago, the State in Italy came to the forefront of the international
scene through its profound exploitation of the tactic of amalgam. In short,
this consisted of lumping together and denouncing as terrorists whole sectors
of the proletarian movement, which could not otherwise be officially accused
of any specific offence. This repressive stroke of inspiration consisted
of making bombs, which were then placed by the State's own police force
(or sectors manipulated by it) in order to produce fear amongst the population
and legitimize the State's terrorist action. The State in Italy has been
combining terrorist action characteristic of any State (mostly physical
and psychological torture) with legislation favouring denouncement, informing,
collaboration, etc... for over fifteen years; little by little, this practice
has become an international legal model used as an example by the police
and legal forces of an ever-increasing number of countries.
<p>Today, on the basis of vague statements made by a repentant (1) and
following some raids in which some weapons were discovered and an "anarchist"
charged, the State investigators, represented by the roman judge Antonio
Marini, have launched a campaign against different groups and militants
calling themselves "anarchist" and are accusing them of forming an "armed
gang". It is clear that the cops are not looking for any culprit in particular,
but want to declare illegal the whole, very contradictory movement articulated
around different structures and positions, whose only point in common is
that they call themselves "anarchist" (2).
<p>It is clear that this kind of attack is not really directed against
"anarchists" in general, given that some of them defend, in Italy just
as elsewhere, clearly reformist and pacifist politics, providing an excellent
service to the State. Moreover, as in the past, the State's tactic aims
to put pressure on the different sectors it has amalgamated, so that they
try to dissociate and exonerate themselves, etc., this course of action
having been shown to produce excellent results. The proof of this can be
seen from the time of the <i>"Red Brigades"</i> or <i>"Prima Linea"</i>,
when such pressure provoked a stream of declarations of dissociation. Certain
sectors of official anarchism such as the <i>"Circulo Berneri"</i> or the
<i>"Italian
Anarchist Federation"</i>, didn't hesitate to openly dissociate themselves
from the accused, by way of communiques in which they declared that those
charged had nothing to do with anarchists, are provocateurs and that anarchists
would never carry out armed action.
<p>Agents of repression generally leave official "anarchists" alone, trying
to identify and strike hard at those whom they consider to be the real
enemies of the State. But, as judges and cops are unable to consider subversion
as a "natural" and inevitable product of misery and oppression, limiting
their imagination to a group of conspirators, numerous mistakes are made
which lead to the sentencing of militants or of whole sectors that are
not even developing any revolutionary activity (and vice-versa).
<p>From the end of 1995, and throughout 1996, a whole series of trials,
raids, arrests, prosecutions, amalgams, statements, campaigns,... followed
one after the other, climaxing on 17th September 1996 in a raid on some
60 houses and apartments in different towns in Italy and the arrest of
dozens of militants, pushing even more militants into hiding in its wake.
Some of the arrested militants have been accused of murder and bank robberies,
but the great majority are accused, with no evidence, of belonging to the
same "armed gang" (an organisation supposedly called <i>"Organizzazione
Rivoluzionaria Anarchista Insurrezionalista"</i>) and charged with: <b>being
an <i>"armed gang"</i>, having <i>"subversive associations"</i>, <i>"possessing
weapons and explosives"</i> and committing <i>"crimes against public utilities"</i>.</b>
<p>The reason why we are highlighting this amalgam of militants against
which there is no proof of armed action or use of arms is not because we
want to show solidarity with "innocents", as opposed to those who have
carried out armed actions against private property and the State. This
is the line always taken by reformist and opportunist political organisations.
We consider that the "guilty" will always be an integral part of our movement,
just as revolutionaries at the time of Marx and Bakunin or Flores Magon
and Rodolfo Gonz&aacute;les Pacheco always claimed. The reason why we are
drawing attention to amalgam is because we think it is fundamental to denounce
the fact that the State not only wants to repress those who committed whatever
"crime", but actually all those who represent any kind of danger to the
State, whether or not they have done anything illegal and whether or not
they fit their criteria for charges to be made against them. In short,
it is essential to denounce the State's tactic of amalgam (the creation
of informers, collaborateurs,...) as a method of repression of an extremely
wide social movement, a method that aims to ensure and reproduce class
domination. Let us add that the accused have formally denied belonging
any such clandestine organisation. They explain that, ideologically, an
<i>"anarchist
revolutionary organisation for insurrection"</i>, as a separate and specific
structure, would be a nonsense for anyone calling himself "anarchist" and
that the very concept of such a thing would actually be that of a leninist
organisation and thus contrary to their positions:
<blockquote><i>"Judges know perfectly well that the anarchist organisation
they talk about does not exist. They know that the model of an armed gang
-a mirror image of their own model- cannott be applied to the real relationships
between anarchists. Individuals who meet on the basis of affinity, ie.
according their own differences, and develop initiatives without formalising
any particular points of unity, individuals who do organise, it's true,
but never in a rigid manner, cannot be an armed gang. This is not only
because they refuse clandestinity (a refusal that is of significance in
itself), but because they cannot accept to enrol -neither as a name nor
as a programme- in a structure that makes armed encounters a reality separated
from the subversive totality. And if an anarchist, individually and assuming
all his responsibilities, decides to use weapons, nothing of this reality
is changed. Even if, letting our imagination run riot, all the accused
or even every anarchist in the world, in addition to writing, discussing,
making love, circulating leaflets, insulting bosses, deserting work, occupying
buildings and recuperating commodities were to use weapons, it still would
not make them an armed gang. Those in power need to invent the gang...
The judges want to impose the illusion that, apart from survival and waiting,
there is only armed organisation... Happily, insurrection is not really
what the repressive organs want it to be..."</i></blockquote>

One of the bourgeoisie's strengths is its presentation of the reforms necessary
for the accumulation of capital as working class conquests, as is the case
with the so-called 'reduction in working time', preached by unions and
left-wing parties throughout the world.
<p>In their continuous search for extraordinary surplus value, capitalists
are obliged to constantly update and modernise their means of production
in order to increase productivity. Increases in productivity result, above
all, from an ever more continuous, methodical and intense use of productive
forces, the most important of which is labour power. As capital changes
its methods of work, it also transforms labour power and men themselves,
since it changes the relation of men to work. For proletarians, this always
means an increase in the rate of exploitation; first, because wages do
not depend upon the production of wealth and second, because any growth
in productivity implies an increase in the intensity of work. Under capital,
the installation of new machines always gives rise to an accentuation of
the division of work, to the more rigorous, more scientific and more rational
organisation of working time, submitting proletarians to stricter rules,
regulations and obligations. This is the hunt for 'dead time', the struggle
against absenteeism, the development of mobility of the workforce, continuous
surveillance, stepping up the pace...
<p>Faced with this perpetual reinforcement of exploitation, one of the
working class's constant demands has been, and still is, the reduction
in working time. The bourgeoisie is therefore trying to identify this proletarian
demand with a <i>"legal limit on the working day"</i> (without which social
labour could not be intensified and rendered more productive of surplus-value)
in order to make the <i>"workers' movement"</i> the linchpin of reformism,
of capital's permanent reform.
<p>The <i>"legal reduction in working time"</i> has nothing to do with
a reappropriation of time by the workers and is just a formal reduction
in working time, only measured quantitatively by the chronometer without
any regard for its quality (intensity, density). This measure, far from
being a step towards the emancipation of the proletariat, only aims to
adapt the labour power, the living labour, to the new conditions of exploitation,
to make them accept the increasing dependence of the worker on capitalist
machines, to reinforce the division and programming of their lives according
to the needs of capitalist production, making them, at work as in their
leisure time, simple reproducers of surplus-value.
<p>The reduction in working time as an expression of the proletariat's
emancipation from its secular enslavement to work can only be real in the
context of intense struggle between proletariat and bourgeoisie, in which
the class imposes its demands, antagonistic to the capitalist mode of production,
by force.
<p>It is therefore necessary to distinguish between increase in productivity
and intensification of work. Under capital, both concepts are closely linked
because productivity cannot be increased without reinforcing the intensity
of work and the exploitation of the proletariat. Under proletarian dictatorship,
however, any increase in productivity will lessen the intensity of work
and reduce the exploitation of the proletariat. Communism, because it responds
to human needs rather than the need to accumulate capital, because it will
free the development of productive forces from the shackles of the capitalist
production relationship, will achieve (for example by generalised automation)
a far greater productivity at the same time as abolishing all work.
<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font color="#FF6666">The constant increase
in surplus-labour</font></font></u></h2>
Whereas the serf, for example, worked half the time on his own land and
the other half on his lord's, which made his exploitation obvious, the
wage labourer receives a salary for his whole day of work, which then appears
to have been paid in full. The exploitation of free labour is hidden by
the abstract character of work, creator of value, object of a wage payment:
<blockquote><i>"The private works of isolated individuals do not acquire
the character of social labour in the concrete form in which they were
used in the process of production, but can only acquire it through exchange,
which represents an abstraction of particular objects and of specific forms
of work."</i>
<p>(I.I. Rubin, <i>"Essays on Marx's Theory of Value"</i>).</blockquote>
In the capitalist mode of production, all commodities (including labour
power) must be made equal, reduced to a common denominator, in order to
be able to be exchanged: value or abstract work, whose measure is the social
working time crystallized within it necessary for their reproduction. Every
commodity is therefore sold at its value (the law of supply and demand
making the prices oscillate around this average). So, the worker sells
his labour power by the day while, for example, one hour of work would
be enough to produce the value necessary to reproduce his own force. By
working one hour a day, the worker would have produced enough wealth to
exchange for his means of subsistence (food, clothes, lodging...) The wage
is the payment for this necessary work, without which the proletarian would
not be able to maintain nor reproduce himself. So, by paying the labour
power at its value, the capitalist can appropriate the work done during
the remaining hours of the day without owing anything to the proletarian,
since the contract and the principle that each merchandise is bought at
its value have been respected. We call this part of the work which is appropriated
by the bourgeoisie <b>surplus-labour</b>. The value created during this
surplus-labour is called <b>surplus-value</b>. The relation between necessary
labour and surplus-labour or between wages and surplus-value is <b>the
rate of exploitation.</b>
<p>We have just seen that the working day can be broken down into two parts:
necessary labour and surplus-labour. The capitalist mode of production
can only develop by continually reducing necessary labour and increasing
surplus-labour. For marxists, this relation between necessary and surplus
labour is fundamental <b>- not only is the reduction in daily working time
compatible with the extension of surplus-labour but it is one of the forces
permitting the extension of this free labour.</b>
<p>One possibility for the capitalists to increase surplus-labour is to
lengthen the working day, however the struggle of the working class to
reduce working time has been one of the elements that has pushed capitalists
to increase surplus-labour by reducing necessary labour (1).
<blockquote><i>"But when the surplus-value has to be produced by the conversion
of necessary labour into surplus-labour, it by no means suffices for capital
to take the labour process in the form under which it has heen historically
handed down, and then simply to prolong the duration of that process. The
technical and social conditions of the process, and consequently the very
mode of production must be revolutionised, before the productiveness of
labour can be increased. By that means only can the value of labour power
be made to sink, and the portion of working day necessary for the reproduction
of that value be shortened."</i>
<p>(Marx, <i>"Capital"</i>)</blockquote>
If a capital A can produce, using new production techniques, a greater
amount of goods with less workers than its rivals, it will be able to sell
its products at a lower price than its rivals (and will even be forced
to if it wants to move the greatest number of goods), but at a higher price
than their cost of production (less living work is crystallised in them
and, therefore, less wages and more profit) until the value of identical
commodities on the market decreases as a consequence of the generalisation
of the production process and extraordinary surplus-value thus disappears.
It is through this incessant process that every capitalist is continually
on the look-out for technical innovations, as it is only by conquering
rival markets that he can gain this extraordinary surplus-value.
<p>Forced to increase surplus-labour by reducing necessary-labour, every
capitalist is therefore pushed to increase productivity which decreeases
the social labour time crystallised in each commodity and, in this way,
gives rise to a fall in their value. This drop in value also applies to
the labour-power commodity, signifying a reduction in necessary labour.
Temporarily, this decrease in the value of labour power makes it possible
to realise extraordinary surplus-value. But within this need to reduce
necessary Iabour lies capitalism's fundamental contradiction, between the
process of permanent valorisation and devalorisation. Although the only
source of profit, surplus-value, is just the living labour contained within
each commodity, the growth in productiveness (or increase in the organic
component of capital) always signifies an increase in dead labour (technological
development) compared to living labour (development of labour power). The
realisation of extraordinary surplus-value thus accentuates the decline
in the rate of profit.
<p>One can therefore understand that the costs of investment are continuously
rising tend to lower the rate of profit (relation between profit realised
and the sum of invested capital). At the same time, the constant fall in
the value of commodities gives rise to <b>an accelerated devalorisation
of fixed capital</b> (buildings, machines, tools). The cost of these machines
has to write itself off in a shorter and shorter time, requiring the workforce
to achieve maximum profitability: the machines must be operated day and
night in order to extract enough surplus-value and decrease the cost of
the labour power. This is why, under capitalist production, any increase
in productivity means <b>an increase in proletarians' enslavement to machines</b>,
to dead labour.
<p>Productivity today is capital's productivity. Capital is not concerned
with producing two goods instead of one in order to halve man's suffering
- on the contrary, it is concerned, above  all else, that a greater surplus-value
be realised in these two goods in order to compensate for the devalorisation
of commodities produced with less and less living labour. Every increase
in productivity is therefore accompanied by <b>a relative decrease in wages</b>
(relative to the quantity of wealth produced), a decrease in necessary
labour and an increase in surplus labour. It is a fundamental reality of
Marxism that <b>the degree of exploitation is relative because it is social
and historical</b> that enables us to understand the growing antagonism
between proletariat and bourgeoisie and to demystify all the "social gains",
the "increases buying power", the "reduction in working time".
<p>In Belgium, for example, statistics from the "Universit&eacute; Catholique
de Louvain" show that there was an 11% cut in working hours between 1960
and 1973. But what the bourgeoisie does not reveal is that this "progress"
is due to the extraordinary rise in work productivity, enabling the workers
to produce the same amount of goods in 1973 as in 1960, in only 43% of
the working time. If this rise in work productivity had entirely been in
the workers' favour and had been used to reduce working time, it could
have been reduced not by 11% but by 57%, which would have meant working
less than 20 hours a week! (See the article <i>"Le 'Maintien du pouvoir
d'achat', un mot d'ordre reactionnaire"</i> in <i>Le Communiste</i> No.4)
<p>To limit the cost of new investments as much as possible, the capitalist
is obliged to slow down the development of fixed capital. To increase productivity,
he will centre the modernisation of his productive apparatus on <b>the
search for better ways of intensifying the work of proletarians.</b> It
is this need to increase the intensity of work that forces capital to reduce
the length of the working day, not in order to reduce work, but to increase
it.
<blockquote><i>"Given that any animal force's capacity for action is inversely
proportionate to the time during which it is active, at certain limits
one gains in efficiency what one loses in duration (...) The enormous impulse
that the shortening of the working day gives to the development of mechanical
systems and to cost-cutting obliges the worker also, by making more of
an effort, to provide greater activity over the same period and thus to
condense the work to a degree that he would never have been able to reach
without this shortening."</i>
<p><i>"There is no doubt that the tendancy of capital to save itself by
the systematic intensification of labour and to transform every perfectioning
of the mechanical system into a new means of exploitation must lead to
the point where a further reduction in working hours becomes inevitable."</i>
<p>(Marx, <i>"Capital"</i>)</blockquote>

<u><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font color="#FF6666">The duration of working
time: the expression of a worldwide balance of forces between the classes</font></font></u></h2>
Historically, capital developed itself by the use of forced labour and
by the extension of the working day to its most extreme limits. The descendants
of serfs, who were kicked off communal lands and driven out of the countryside
by farming, were sent where the first textile manufacturing was being set
up, crammed into new industrial centres and locked up in workhouses. Those
who tried to escape, the "vagabonds", were pursued pitilessly, maimed and
killed (in mass hangings), made examples of in order to terrify proletarians.
From Negroes and American Indians to European serfs, they all ended up
in these urban industrial penal colonies (factories) or rural ones (plantations).
All of them were subjected to the misery of "primitive" expropriation and
it was under the terror of weapons, hunger and total misery that they were
educated about the ultimate form of exploitation: <b>wage labour.</b>
<p>All the bourgeois who know a little about history admit the truth of
these facts but do not see the irreversible class antagonism indicated
by them. On the contrary, they only see them as past excesses that progress
has left behind, a bygone period. One of their most effective arguments
is to highlight the reduction in the working day (16, 14, 12, 10, 8...
hours). These are facts that the workers cannot refute, that can be used
to convince them that capitalism is not such an inhuman system and that
enable the bourgeoisie to paint the <i>"leisure society"</i>, the <i>"era
of free time"</i> in glowing colours, to present it as a just reward for
so many years of effort and work for capital, for all the services rendered
to society. But these are just pipedreams, confirmation of the narrow-mindedness
of the bourgeois, who substitute their ideal vision of their own class
situation, of their society, for the reality of the world.
<p>In the historical centres of accumulation and concentration of capital,
the big cities of South America, North America, Europe, Africa, where millions
have been put to work, the legal duration of the working day is on the
decrease. However, this is soley due to the fantastic development of productivity,
which has allowed capital to stabilize social turmoil and to impose social
peace by granting <i>"advantages"</i> to certain categories of proletarians,
whilst at the same time increasing the extraction of surplus-value, the
rate of exploitation. Similarly, the only way of achieving capitalist valorisation
in poorly populated, deserted areas is to maintain extremely long working
days to compensate for the weak organic composition of capital, making
the working conditions of these workers similar to "historically outmoded"
social relations.
<p>In some parts of the U.S.A., for example, (the symbol of "developed
society"), the extraction of surplus value takes the form of slavery (see
the article in <i>Comunismo</i> No.7 on the working conditions of the clandestine
immigrants in Texas, Florida, Virginia...). The flourishing multinational
food company "Gulf and Western" has its offices in ultra-modern buildings
in New York, where its employees work according to the U.S. company legal
standards. However, it obtains its raw materials in Haiti where it is public
knowledge that the sugar piantations are real slave-camps (work with practically
no rest, miserable wages, permanent military surveillance of the agricultural
workers...). But it is not only in America that wage labour can be seen
to be no more than a life sentence of forced labour. There are the Siberian
labour camps, those in South Africa, Mauritania, Mali, as well as the concentration
"communities" in Cambodia, China, Haiti... Where is the industrial centre
in which "black work" is not a major, or even an essential, factor for
the economy? New York, Chicago, Hong-Kong, they all have their "sweatshops"
and masses of home-workers:
<blockquote><i>"after eight or nine hours in workshops, the employees take
their piece of work home where they continue for another five or six hours...the
working conditions in the sweatshops are barely imaginable, it is not rare
to see thirty sewing machines crammed into a small room with no ventilation,
window, nor door other than the front door."</i>
<p>(<i>Le Monde Diplomatique</i>, March 1982)</blockquote>
The "clandestine" dress-making workshops of Paris are well known and factories
for children in Naples and Bangkok no longer surprise the bourgeois press.
<blockquote><i>"The number of children and teenagers less than 15 years
old who work throughout the world has increased again over the last two
years. Today we calculate at least 55 million, but experts state that this
figure grossly underestimates the true extent of the phenomenon."</i>
<p>(<i>Le Monde</i>, 10-11/5/1981, from an investigation by the International
Labour Bureau)
<p><i>"Industrial subcontracting drains sections of workers from major
metropolitan industry everywhere... In Italy, small businesses, revived
by the crisis, functioning on the edge of legality and clandestinity, are
often considered to be the basis of the 'second Italian miracle'. In Japan,
recent investigations have shown that subcontracting is an essential key
to the present success of Japanese products on the world market... Forms
of working at home, subcontracting techniques and the "sweating systems",
thought to have all but disappeared in the West, have taken on a new lease
of life as sectors controlled by major industry. Thus, the dispersed factory
(or, as the Italians call it, "diffuse industry") has to be regarded as
one of the particularities of the new organisation of productive space."</i>
<p>(<i>Le Monde Diplomatique</i>, January 1982)</blockquote>
By portraying these facts as excesses of the capitalist system, or as left-overs
from pre-capitalist social relations, the bourgeoisie does not only conceal
their true extent, but also gives credibility to "normal", "legal" work.
But whether produced in "clandestine" workshops or in recognised factories,
commodities are the same, produced to valorise capital, in both places
the proletarian selling his labour power in order to survive. The needs
of proletarians working there are never satisfied: unemployment, for example,
mainly affects workers in "official" companies but the black markets and
industrial penal-colonies feed off the misery emanating from society. For
us, there is no real difference between proletarian labour in New York,
Haiti and the Siberian mines and we think it is vital to assert the similarity
of wage-slavery all over the world (see the article on worker-aristocracy
in <i>Le Communiste</i> No.10/11).
<p>Some bourgeois claim that the "historical" reduction in working time
is a materialization of the gains of the workers' movement, proof that
capitalism and socialism can coexist and that there can be a progressive
and peaceful transition from one to the other. It is always dangerous for
the bourgeoisie to reverse reductions in working time that were give up
under the pressure of workers' struggles without compromising the credibility
of its social system (for example, the 40 hours in France in 1936, the
8 hour day in "Soviet" Russia and in Germany following the revolutionary
struggles of 1917-1923). After crushing the revolutionary wave of the 1920's,
in the name of the workers' well-being, the bourgeoisie was obliged to
increase productivity fast, in order to increase the rate of exploitation.
The resulting deep and violent changes in the organic composition of capital
(increase in constant capital compared to variable capital) led to an exacerbation
of competition and conflicts between the different centres of capitalist
concentration. The valorisation of capital forced the appropriation and/or
destruction of rival productive forces. This mutual destruction, especially
of labour power and the generalisation of forced and militarised labour-camps
across the planet, represent the supposed "gains" of the working class
movement.
<p>In 1848, when the English parliament voted the first laws limiting the
length of the working day (the Factory Act), it was to put an end to workers'
agitation that was threatening to turn into civil war. After the legislation
ruling a 10 hour day (which was accompanied by a wage-cut of 25 %) the
<i>"working
class, declared criminal, was struck by prohibition and put under the law
of suspects"</i> (Marx, <i>"Capital"</i>). In the same way, in France,
reforms promulgated after February 1848 <i>"enforced the same limit to
the working day on all workshops and factories, without distinction, (...)
declaring as a principle what had been gained in England in the name of
women, children and miners only."</i> (Marx, <i>"Capital"</i>). However,
they were soon followed by the bloody crushing of the June insurrection
in Paris. The bourgeois used this link between <i>"the constant pressure
of the workers' agitating from the outside"</i> and legislative intervention,
to rapidly transform working-class struggle into a fight for rights and
social laws passed by the State to reform its own system for "social gains".
<p>It was under the threat of proletarian revolt and brewing civil war
that the bourgeois class disciplined and unified itself, in spite of many
obstacles, at the heart of the State, defender of the general interests
of the bourgeois class. Laws limiting the length of the working day supervened
when the interdependence of companies had been sufficiently developed by
the division of labour and it had become vital for the bourgeoisie to avoid
social unrest -caused by the excesses of some capitalists who were "behind
the times"- unrest which could compomise the whole of capital. In the same
way it became necessary for social reproduction to adapt the workers to
their continuously transforming tools and new living conditions. This is
why the State passed laws limiting women's labour time and banning child
labour, yet at the same time introducing obligatory schooling and a family
code (the obligation of domestic work at home).
<p>But despite the reduction in labour time, the proletarian's time is
increasingly submitted to capital's needs, be it in his working time, the
time taken to travel between home and workplace, the time needed to sort
out all the administration imposed upon him - police, union, social security
business, etc., the time taken for professional training, the time he needs
to treat his work-induced ailments, the time to reproduce his labour power...
<b>all
this social time belongs to capital.</b>
<p>Social laws only materialise the bourgeois pretention to manage a system
of production based on enslavement to labour, whilst conferring it with
some scientific and humanitarian legitimacy. They are no more than the
formalisation of the bourgeoisie's humanist and progressist principles
that <i>"the worker sells his labour power in order to reproduce it, not
to destroy it"</i> and that <i>"even the interests of capital demand a
normal working day of him."</i>
<blockquote><i>"Their fantastic development (that of the major branches
of industry in which the 10 hour law had been applied) from 1853 to 1860,
hand in hand with the physical and moral renaissance of the workers, even
struck
the least perceptive. The manufacturers themselves, from whom the legal
limitation and laws on the working day had been torn limb by limb by half
a century's civil war, made the contrast that existed between the still
"free" branches of exploitation and the establishments that had submitted
to the law stand out ostentatiously."</i>
<p>(Marx, <i>"Capital"</i>)</blockquote>
At the time, Marx was already concluding that, far from being the product
of a revolutionary transformation of society, <i>"the minutely detailed
edicts which ruled the period militarily and precisely, the limits and
the breaks in work (...) were born from the circumstances and developed
bit by bit as natural laws of the modern mode of production."</i>
<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font color="#FF6666">The so-called "historical"
reduction in France</font></font></u></h2>
Affected by the world crisis, all states are faced with the collapse of
their "growth rate" (rate of profit). There is a surplus production of
goods and at the same time an accelerated devalorisation of fixed capital,
which forces the capitalists to restrain investment. In response to this
investment crisis (described by the left and the unions as "the flight
of capital"), the bourgeoisie busies itself with the umpteenth "industrial
restructuration" (discovery of new forms of organisation and management
of work). But they are unable to grasp and solve the fundamental factor
which gives rise to devalorisation: the contradiction and growing antagonism
at the heart of the commodity between use value and exchange value. The
measures they take only postpone the inevitable bankruptcies, whilst imposing
the needs and interests of the dominant class on the proletarians. By attributing
the causes of, or the answers to, crises to the question of form (neo-liberalism
or, on the contrary, Keynsian politics, self-management or co-management),
the bourgeoisie is arming itself to crush the revolutionary proletariat.
The "false consciousness" of the bourgeoisie is dictated by its dominant
class position which it has to defend. Thus, behind governmental reforms,
are always fundamental class interests. The call for <i>"a reduction in
working time to 39 hours a week"</i> by the Socialist government in France,
signifies the launching of a new period of systematic attacks on the proletariat.
<p>All capital needs is to render labour power more and more submissive
and available in order to control its use and its cost, according to the
demands of valorisation, restructuration and concentration. By trying to
pass off any increase in productivity as the result of mechanical advances,
without recognizing the inevitable intensification of work that it entrains
for proletarians, socialist governments make a purely capitalist measure
look like a "workers' victory", thus pushing the workers to consider their
interests and those of the national economy to be one and the same. Sacrifices,
austerity measures, discipline and work are the very principles of the
"solidarity" referred to so often by the government. The same principle
and reality exists behind any so-called alternatives such as unemployment
or a distribution of work that would permit a reduction in working time:
an absolute reduction in wages, a supplementary measure aiming to totally
submit the proletariat to the bourgeois state.
<p>The "historic" shift from the 40 to the 39 hour week in France must
be seen in the context of the general tendency of all governments, whatever
their political "colour", to reduce the legal working time. The official
length of the working week in manufacturing industry was changed between
1970 and 1979 from 44.9 to 43.22 in Great Britain, 43.3 to 40.6 in Japan
and 39.9 to 35.4 in Belgium. Between 1974 and 1980 the greatest reductions
were seen in Norway and Israel, being at least 4 hours. While the working
week was 40.6 hours in France in 1980, it was 39.7 in the USA, 39.1 in
Australia, 37.7 in Austria, 33.4 in Belgium and 32.9 in Denmark... (<i>Le
Monde</i>, 16.2.82).
<p>The whole agreement on <i>"the reduction in working time"</i> signed
by the bosses and trade unions in France was guided by the aim to make
their industry more competitive, thanks to a <b>more systematic use of
fixed capital</b> (the duration of use of equipment in the automobile industry
reached 6150 hours in the USA, 4000 to 4600 hours in Japan and 3700 to
4000 hours in France) and a <b>greater flexibility of the work timetable</b>
(in the USA as in Japan, timetables are well adapted to the needs of the
market and overtime is practiced on a large scale, between 10 and 15% in
Japan).
<p><i>"Investments in industrial equipment decrease by 12% in 1981"</i>
said a headline in <i>Le Monde</i> on 9 June 1982. According to the <i>Lib&eacute;ration</i>
on 14 September 1981, <i>"since 1975 all increases in wealth are the result
of efficiency improvements in production"</i>. In order compensate for
lack of investment, the bourgeoisie strives to maximise the profitability
of its machines by having them operated day and night, by a <b>more mobile,
flexible and less expensive</b> mass of proletarians.
<p>With the deepening of the crisis, teamwork and shiftwork has become
generalised. Shiftwork is standard for a third of the workers and half
of these work on night-shifts. The steel, textile and paper industries
and the mines traditionally had the greatest numbers of shift workers,
up to 85%. Over the past few years, this mode of work has extended to the
food industry and the service sector. The percentage of workers on shifts
in processing industry more than doubled between 1957 and 1977. This increase
in shift work has to be seen in relation to the record growth in productivity:
the quantity of goods produced in one hour by Belgian industry almost tripled
over the same period.
<p>The French Prime minister can say what he likes, that <i>"reforms will
make the machines sweat instead of men, that they will improve the relationship
between man and his work and that this will create new and more skilled
jobs"</i>, but a simple run-down of the application of their measures refutes
these promises:
<ul>
<li>
extension of shiftwork with a fifth team to enable work around the clock.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
generalisation of temporary work, with short term contracts.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
extension of overnight work for women and week end work.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
the fight against "dead time" to make the each of the 35 hours work effective.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
overtime payments to be limited to only 25% more of usual wages.</li>
</ul>
As Minister Auroux said: <i>"Increasing productivity is not a mechanical
operation, but rather reflects a kind of support by the wage labourers."</i>
<p>These working conditions plan the life of workers to the rhythm and
demands of capitalist valorisation. Frequently changing timetables disorganise
the rhythm of life of the workers, many of whom are exhausted, with disturbed
sleep and eating patterns. Experiments have shown that night work requires
more physical and nervous energy to achieve the same production and that
morbidity of shift workers is higher than the average. Consequently, the
<i>"socialist
government's 39 hour week"</i> is actually aiming to generalise
<b>an increase
in the intensity of work and of the exploitation of proletarians.</b> It
is this that Prime Minister Mauroy called <i>"the improvement of the relationship
between man and his work"</i> (2). For him, as for Stalin and all capitalists:
<i>"Man
is the most precious capital".</i>
<p>There was no need to wait for Raymond Barre to congratulate the Socialist
government to understand that the agreements on the "reduction in working
time" were the beginning of a major attack on the working class. Just a
few months after the legislation was passed the Socialist government established
what was referred to as "pecuniary compensation", which turned out to be
nothing but a direct attack on wages. New "solidarity taxes" were leeched
from civil servants and "solidarity" contracts drawn up between unions
and bosses (wage-cuts from 1,6 % at Gervais-Danone and B.S.N. to 20% at
Fleury-Michon). The left-wing government made generalised wage-cuts obligatory.
It was the rises in V.A.T. on manufactured goods and services, devaluation,
wage freezes, decreases in unemployment benefits -all attacks on proletarians'
real wages- that served to finance the aid to industry agreed upon in the
"solidarity contracts" (<i>"the companies which succeed in reducing working
time to 36 hours a week by September 1983 will be free from social security
subscriptions for any extra job vacancies arising from the reduction in
working time"</i>).
<p>The constant increase in unemployment (now more than 2 million under
the Socialist government) refutes the "socialist solutions" to unemployment
in practice. While Minister Delors admitted that <i>"the shift from 40
to 39 hours has not created new jobs"</i>, the so-called reduction in working
time, presented as the spearhead of the fight against unemployment, revealed
its true aim: <b>a systematic attack on the working class.</b> The French
Socialists' employment plans only signify <b>attacks on the "longterm unemployed",
cuts in unemployment benefit, increases in the intensity of work and general
wage-cuts.</b> The Mauroy plans are merely a repetition of those implemented
by the bourgeoisie throughout the world.
<p>In this way, the left not only brings in permanent cuts in relative
wages, as every reduction in hours must be accompanied by an increase in
productivity (of 10% at Gervais-Danone) and therefore of the intensity
of work, but they also plan a drop in real wages (buying power). Yet Mauroy
still declared that <i>"the excessive rises in nominal revenue and wages
are preventing our economy from creating jobs. The government has decided
to act!"</i> When can we expect a general drop in nominal wages?
<p>The French government, like all governments, tries to promote the distribution
of work, that is to say varying timtetables throughout the year in order
to, in the words of the president of Air-France, <i>"compensate for the
rigidity of the organisation of working time, which leads to the often
insufficient yearly use of more and more sophisticated equipment, thus
inhibiting the development of the productivity of such equipment."</i>
The principle guiding the limitation of working time is therefore that
of rationalisation, economy with the cost of labour power, whilst increasing
capital's productivity and thus the intensity of work.

limits although they are very extendable. These extreme limits are provided
by the strength of the worker. If the daily exhaustion of his vital strength
goes beyond a certain degree, he will not be able to undertake a new activity.
Nevertheless, as we said, this limit is extendable. A rapid succession

<td><font face="Comic Sans MS">In this text we have shown that capital
always tries to recuperate working class struggles, workers' demands always
expressing proletarians' permanent interest to work less. The formal reduction
in working time (the government's 35 hour week) corresponds to an important
increase in the rate of exploitation and in the rate of surplus value extracted
from the proletarians. In fact, the reduction in working time, from the
capitalist point of view (which includes all demands/promises made by governments,
unions, leftists...) always corresponds to a decrease in necessary work
so as to <b>increase the proportion of surplus work</b>, even if this is
occurs in a day of 7 instead of 8 hours. From this point of view, if the
working day is reduced in length, there must be an <b>increase in its intensity,
an increase in exploitation.</b></font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">The proletarian point of view is obviously
completely opposed to this increase in exploitation. Workers' struggle
always tries to limit exploitation as much as possible, in its intensity
as well as its duration. It is always the proletarians' interest to work
less, i.e. to create less surplus value and obtain wage rises. True workers'
struggle, real proletarian demands, correspond to this historical perspective
alone and therefore turn their backs on bourgeois demands, on pseudo-strikes
for the "government's 35 hours week", on the "maintenance of buying power"...
all of which amount to nothing else but the restructuration of capital
(camouflaging unemployment with part-time work, for example) and increased
exploitation (campaign against "dead time", increased work pace, wage cuts).
As long as there has been proletariat and bourgeoisie, workers' struggle
has expressed, even at the most basic level, the tendency to reduce working
time and to increase wages, be it by sabotage, by theft or by striking,
imposing, albeit on a temporary basis, decreased working time and/or higher
wages. It goes without saying that in certain struggles, the demand for
a 40 hour week really corresponds to the workers' struggle, whereas in
others this same concretisation actually signifies the liquidation of the
struggle. However, what is crucial is that the character of these demands
is directly antagonistic to capital's logic, to the production of surplus
value.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Capital aims to strip any concretisation
of proletarian interests of its class content, by legalising it and turning
it into a "workers' victory", implementing its capitalist content -increasing
exploitation. The class difference between, for example, the 1st of May
as an international day of struggle and its legalisation/transformation
into a holiday for the glorification of alienated labour is the same as
that between the reduction in working time seen from the perspective of
the abolition of wage labour, of all work and its legalisation/transformation
into capitalist restructuration. In the conflict between the reduction
in working time corresponding to the interests of the proletariat and the
same formula corresponding to the interests of capital, lies the whole
antagonism separating the revolutionary proletariat from the bourgeoisie.</font></td>

In April 1993, we published an article entitled "Aids, pure product of
Science" in French in <i>Communisme</i> No.38. Since then, it has been
translated and published in our central reviews in Spanish and English
(<i>Communism</i> No.8) and has been sent around the world, giving rise
to much reaction, republication and reproduction. In Argentina and Uruguay,
assemblies of proletarians from the health services used our text as a
basis for discussion about science and the scientific origin of AIDS. We
have had (and continue to receive) numerous expressions of support for
the arguments developed in the article.
<p>The reason we are returning to the subject today is that every day current
events confirm our arguments further and reveal the ocean of lies and confusion
upon which Science sails.
<p>To recap briefly, in the text we assert that AIDS had its origin in
the early '70's, a direct product of the new commercial possibilities opened
up by molecular biology at that time. In order to distance its scientific
origin from the appearance of AIDS, all scientists, researchers,... worked
furiously to separate the date of the illness's appearance from the period
in which material conditions made laboratory fabrication of the retrovirus
possible.
<blockquote><i>"... to distance the date of the appearance of HIV from
the period in which material conditions meant that it could be produced
in laboratories -as early as 1971 -, the researchers (of lies!) simply
"discovered" a few cases of AIDS plump in the middle of the 50's and 60's
in Africa. But it rapidly became apparent that tests supposedly demonstrating
antibodies to the deadly virus in those old test tubes were invalid. In
the end it was decided to diagnose it retrospectively on the basis of a
vague resemblance to symptoms described in the files of the patients whose
blood had been taken!!! To prove the truth of a premise, what better way
than to invent it?"</i></blockquote>
Since then, in order to persuade everybody that AIDS existed well before
1971, most of the "specialists" have based their justifications on tissue
analysis from a man who died in 1959. Hundreds of pages have been written
about this case in many scientific papers. At last Science had found proof
dating the origin of AIDS to long before the birth of molecular biology!
Here is what a journalist said in 1992:
<blockquote><i>"There are numerous scientists who think that AIDS first
appeared in Equatorial Africa. The first proof of its presence on the African
continent dated from a blood test taken in 1959 in what was then called
Leopoldville (Belgian Congo) now known as Kinshasa (Zaire)."</i>
<p>-Extract from "Rolling Stone" in <i>El Clarin</i> (Argentina), 22/03/92-</blockquote>
After the barrage of lies published by the press for so many years, people
have placed the responsibility for AIDS far away from Science. AIDS ? -
not Science's fault but Africa's!
<p>And now that there is no longer any interest in the origin of AIDS,
the AFP, creeping quietly on tiptoes, published these few lines:
<blockquote><i>"The case of AIDS of 1959 has been shown to be false. Analysed
again, the man's tissues contain a virus dating from 1990. The first man
recognized as dying of AIDS did not have that illness (...). Tissues that
had enabled this diagnosis to be reached had not come from his body (...)
Two
hypotheses: either an accidental mix up of tissue in the laboratories,
which is inconceivable</i> (sic!)<i>, or a deliberate swapping of test
tubes."</i>
<p>-A.F.P. in <i>Le Nouveau Quotidien</i> (Switzerland), 27/03/95-</blockquote>
