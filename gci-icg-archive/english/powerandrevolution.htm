The successive revolts in different places of the planet, and especially
in America, put again the proletariat and its revolutionary practice forward:
Ecuador, Algeria, Argentina, Bolivia, Peru, etc.
<p>However, the international ideological action of the counterrevolution
succeeds again and again to socially deny this reality throughout the world.
The proletariat is not recognized in these struggles and their revolutionary
character is even less assumed.
<p>As ever for the revolutionary struggles in history (e.g. the revolutionary
struggles in Mexico and Russia in the early XXth century were considered
as peasants' struggles against feudalism), the facts are ascribed to different
social strata, or even to "ethnic groups", that obviously cannot have a
revolutionary perspective as such: lumpenproletariat, peasants, indigenous
population, students, inhabitants of suburbs and shanty towns, miners,
workers, petit-bourgeois, etc. As we already emphasized in our previous
publications, this contributes to maintaining the quarantine lines that
divide the world in regions and countries so that proletarians from other
regions don't support these struggles. This issue is fundamental in the
current reproduction of the bourgeois domination. It's obvious that these
mechanisms of domination are working because the proletariat itself, at
the level international, is neither aware being one and the same class,
nor having a revolutionary social project, what is determining (and is
also deepened through) the greatest weakness and the isolation of the revolutionary
small circles at the level international.
<p>We want to stress here on a central main line: the analysis of this
negation of the revolutionary character of the proletariat struggle. A
negation that, as an invariant way in history, doesn't start from what
the struggle contains as antagonistic to the whole current society, but
from what the protagonists are expressing and supporting as watchwords
or are writing upon their flags. A negation that also takes as a basis
the propaganda of a whole of bourgeois solutions, reformist, managementist
and autonomist ones, that is tried to be imposed to the movement in order
to restrict it to the capitalistic prospects and to remove it from its
revolutionary perspective.
<p>We analyse the first aspect of this negation, while emphasizing, as
revolutionary militants always did, that the struggle of the proletariat
is revolutionary with its content and not with what the flags of the movement
are expressing; if not, it would be impossible to find a single revolutionary
struggle in history. With regard to class struggle in Argentina, we stress
on the practical and general antagonism between bourgeois society and proletarian
interests, between the whole of ideological expressions of the movement
and the objective practice of the proletariat, antagonistic to private
property and the State as well. It is on this basis that we assert the
invariant alternative: either the catastrophe, involved by this system
for human race, will carry on with getting worse, or the proletariat is
destroying State and capitalism in a revolutionary way.
<p>The second aspect of this negation is composed by fashionable theories
(or better said, by ideologies) that are denying this antagonism and trying
to show some compromise solutions. The common denominator of these ideologies
is to show the possibility to "change the world" without the revolutionary
dictatorship of the proletariat, that is to say without the social revolution
that will destroy capital and the bourgeois State.

We are going now to try to explain here, into some lines, the global antagonism
existing between the conception of social revolution and the ideology that
is nowadays especially fashionable, which would like to change the world
without destroying the power of capital.
<p>The enemy is always trying to distort the revolutionary conception.
This is the reason why the supporters of the theses about the non struggle
for power are persisting to assert that the difference between reform and
revolution is out of date. This is false; nothing has been out of date!
The antagonism between revolution and salvation of capitalism with the
help of reforms will remain until social revolution doesn't take place!
What happens in reality is that these reformists don't dare to simply assume
what they are. They know that in order to efficiently spread confusion
ideologically speaking, they have to look like a soft mixture of reformism
and revolution. But even on this issue, they don't show any original aspect!
Kautsky spent his life being a tightrope walker between what was at that
time called reform and revolution and, in practice, his conception acted
like one of the most powerful ideological brakes, that is to say like one
of the best weapons of the counterrevolution.
<p>It's not only the struggle for power that these people are rejecting;
what they reject first and foremost is the struggle for the destruction
of bourgeois power and therefore the struggle for the constitution of a
proletarian power, the revolutionary struggle as a whole.
<p>And indeed revolutionary struggle is inevitably a struggle for power.
Either power is in the hands of capital, or it is in the hands of revolution.
There is no half-measure! Even though, regionally, there can be a short
period corresponding to what has been defined during history as powers
duality (e.g. in Russia 1917) -and while leaving here to one side the fact
that this concept has never been useful for revolution but has always been
a source of confusion-, we have to assert that such a situation cannot
last, it has necessarily to be resolved, either in favour of the conservation
of order, or for social revolution: if the power of capital is not destroyed,
this one necessarily destroys the power that emerged from the revolt. Any
illusion about a counter-power without a destructive action of the power
of capital can only encourage the reorganization of this last. This is
what is voluntarily not mentioned by the current supporters of the theory
of counter-power. They also fail to say that there is no comparison between
none of the current situations and a situation defined as a powers duality.
In order to render the contrast still more obvious, let's recall that in
Russia in 1917, it was about a proletarian insurrection against the bourgeois
State and that, if there is a meaning to speak about "double power", it
referred to the revolutionary decomposition of the repressive forces that
more and more overtly refused orders of the State and that rose up with
entire regiments and began to serve the proletarian organs that the revolution
created in the process of its development.
<p>This being said, in this period where the proletariat and its vanguards
are asserting themselves in the streets but while the lack of knowledge
of the program is quite tragic, it seems for us essential to claim some
central elements of the revolutionary struggle that are systematically
hidden or distorted by whole the current theories, which want "to change
the world without taking the power" or advocating "socialization or communisation
of the world” without destruction of capital's power.
<p>Social revolution implies two inseparable sides:
<br>• the destruction of armed apparatus of the bourgeoisie and more globally
the destruction of capitalistic State as a whole, which obviously means
all the institutions that secure the reproduction of class domination and
exploitation (e.g. parties, unions, churches, jails, armies, schools, etc.);
<br>• the destruction of capital's economical dictatorship, which lives
on the autonomy of the productive structures, on the autonomous decisions
taken by the productive units based on the private property of the means
of production.
<p>If the first point is well known by internationalist vanguards, the
second point is unfortunately less known and had been very little clarified
by the different revolutionary groups during history. All along his work,
Marx emphasized that the key of merchant society (and capitalism is the
generalized merchant society!) lies in the fact that production is private
and that it becomes social only through exchange. The necessary destruction
of production for exchange implies the destruction of the private nature
of production, and therefore the destruction of the autonomous decisions
of companies and companies as well, as subject of free and independent
decision, i.e. the basis of democratic rights. It can be achieved only
if the production is directly social, what implies the organic centralization
of all the decisions concerning the production, which means the revolutionary
dictatorship of the associate producers. Revolution must not only destroy
the mode of distribution (as any bourgeois socialism would like to do),
it must also destroy the mode and the content of production and must decide
upon completely different bases what is to be produced and how to produce.
<p>In other words, the barbarism of the capitalistic society doesn't only
lie in the fact that the rich are more and more rich and the poor more
and more poor, as vulgar socialism wears itself out repeating. The barbarism
of the capitalistic society lies in the fact that the objective of the
production is not the human being but profit. Since centuries, the produced
commodities are only the caricature of what the human being needs (use
values are nothing else but a medium for the value!). Things and services
produced as commodities contain the indelible mark of private production
of commodities, a production whose goal is to reduce mankind into slavery.
Not only objects of consumption are contaminated by the historic dictatorship
of the profit rate -they are created, not for human life, but to be sold-,
but the means of production themselves have been conceived not to spare
labour but to increase the rate of profit. This is why social revolution
implies the fact that the whole of the material production is being called
into question; it implies the liquidation of any autonomous decision (in
enterprises, municipalities, assemblies, etc.), which are necessarily took
according to the possibilities of exchange. The basis for social revolution
can only be the complete change of the whole production relations and the
production objective; otherwise any speech about a “new society” is nothing
but idealistic masturbation. The depth of the social revolution will precisely
be assessed at its capacity to transform radically (at the root!) the whole
of the production, at its capacity to abolish the autonomous decisions
of private property and therefore the exploitation relations, at its capacity
to organically and generally impose the human needs, which turn any production
into a human production. For the first time, being human won't be determined
anymore by the production relations, but while deciding all the aspects
of material production, he will annihilate the domination exercised over
him by the objective world (the economy) and will be able to begin to live
his real history as conscious humanity.
<p>Reformists, with their theories of non struggle for the power, deny
the whole aspects of the revolutionary struggle: they not only deny the
necessity to destroy capital as political, repressive and ideological force,
what is obviously very serious at all, but they also refute the necessity
to destroy the private production, of which the principle of autonomy in
the decision yet constitutes the key of the production for exchange, the
essence of capitalism as generalized merchant mode of production. They
reject the destruction of capitalism, but also the consequent and indispensable
construction of a centralized revolutionary political force. The big theoretical
vacuum of these reformists about the transition period State obviously
ensues from their ideology of non destruction of the bourgeois State and
their rejection (implicit or explicit according to the cases) of the dictatorship
of the proletariat, which is the negation in act of any State.
<p>There is an apology towards autonomous units, enterprises occupation
and autonomous management, districts self-management in a local, productive
and distributive way. The very concept of defence of any particularism
into a superior entity (the multitude!) (1), the apology of exchange networks,
of diffuse networks, is only pushing to the development of these autonomous
(and in fact necessarily private) bases, which constitutes the key of merchant
society, of bourgeois society. Multitudes, diffuse networks, self-management,
exchange networks cannot make anything else but to produce as autonomous
private units, they can only replicate the private character of the production.
The maximum to which this very “libertarian” multiple exchange society
can long for is a small distributive reform (and we even see this as quite
limited because the present reformism, in a full social disaster, is incapable
of real changes). And even, this is possible only if this small reform
doesn't disturb too much one or the other force of the armed capital. But
multiple and varied units, Councils of good or bad governments, cooperatives,
big or small enterprises, ecological and/or self-managed farms, occupied
ones or under workers’ control, all of them will irreparably try to become
profitable and will therefore prove to be absolutely impotent facing the
absurd (inhuman) present production, fruit of centuries of dictatorship
of the value having reduced the human being in slavery. The dictatorship
of the profit rate will continue to direct what is produced and how to
produce.
<p>The revolutionary dictatorship of the proletariat, on the contrary,
will liquidate the very roots of this society, it will impose the dictatorship
of the human needs against all autonomous production and against mercantilism
that ensues from it, it will liquidate the production for exchange (and
therefore for profit) and will call into question the whole of the produced
“things” (that indeed have been conceived on basis of inhuman criteria),
in order to build a material production (2) finally settled by the human
being, finally conceived to release mankind from labour, a production according
to its real needs and human desires. Until now, mankind never determined
its own history; it is the material contradictions, and especially the
social relations of production, which imposed upon it. Without destruction
of capital, mankind’s freedom and autonomy in decision are nothing else
but dictatorship of the value upon the human species. The condition so
that the human being undertakes his own history is precisely that he imposes
his real needs of human being and that he destroys violently and without
any complaisance the economic law, which hides itself behind the words
freedom, autonomy, democracy, self-management, etc.: i.e. the law of value.

<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">Notes</font></u></h3>
1. For the advocates of the multitude, unity is a unity of categories separated
by capital. They insist to maintain workers’ peculiar specificity, on the
one of unemployed, housewives, students, natives, minors, etc. In brief,
they insist to maintain all the categories produced by wage labour, by
capitalism. The unity always claimed by the Communists is on the contrary
the unity of the class, which is opposes to private property and capital
on all the aspects of its life. The unity of the proletariat is not based
on the immediate time and the separation into categories, but on the community
of struggle against capitalism and therefore on Communism as a struggle
and as a social perspective.
<p>2. Absolutely everything must be call into question because absolutely
everything is determined by the rate of profit: all the objects of human
consumption have been historically determined by the maximisation of profit,
all the means of production have been conceived to spare capital and not
the human effort, all the shapes of extraction of nature products take
exclusively into account the rate of profit.
