Social-democracy, as the bourgeois party for workers, takes its program
from a positivation of aspects of the <b>present</b> society and from an
apology for the various institutions of the bourgeois world. The very definition
of social-democracy, which historically represents the alliance (that is
to say the dissolution) between the (proletarian) social party and the
(bourgeois) democratic party, contains the "socialist" positivation of
democracy. From Bernstein to Luxemburg and Kautsky, reformism always aims
at the conciliation of democracy (which is nothing but the social organization
peculiar to commodity production society guaranteeing the bourgeois dictatorship)
with socialism; a project which appears in all of its texts (of the 19th
or the 20th centuries) and even in its own name (social-democratic party).
<p>Therefore it is not surprising that social-democracy has tried, by fair
means or foul, to embellish the face of the state and to make it seem positive
by defending the necessity to set it "free", "popular", "democratic",...
This is a historical tendency which is inherent to the bourgeois state
inasmuch as the state can only fully fulfil its function if it hides its
real class nature, its intrinsically despotic character, and presents itself
as popular (and not as bourgeois!), as democratic, as the representative
of the whole society (and not only that of the dominant class!), as the
guarantor for the realization of the ideals of liberty (and not that of
dictatorship!).
<p>It is thus quite normal that this historical tendency appeared very
early and has been formulated in an explicit way by these bourgeois sectors
or parties, namely by the social democratic parties, especially conceived
to frame and neutralize workers, that is to say, by the historical party
of the social democracy, regardless of its label. This tendency has been
materialized, at least since the second half of the 19th century, by a
series of realizations and structuring of the capitalist state, more or
less openly supported by socialist parties. From Bismarck to Bonaparte,
from the Stalinist state to the people's states of the so-called "socialist
countries", the claims to <b>set the state more popular</b> and the demand
for <b>liberty for the bourgeois state</b> remain a permanent ideology
of the capitalist dictatorship, defended on innumerable occasions by avowed
or hidden heirs of the most classic historical fraction/section of social-democracy:
the German social-democracy.
<p>This is the reason why in such an important text about
<b>liberty</b>,
and particularly about the democratico-bourgeois claim of liberty as the
expression of the commodity producing development of the society, it seems
indispensable for us to include an appendix about the classic social-democratic
claim of
<b>free state</b> (a claim which contains such democratic demands
as "the liberty of Science", "the liberty of conscience", etc). Since the
demand for free state cannot be separated from that of
<b>people's state</b>
(which is also a democratic state), it is understandable that we found
it relevant to analyze these claims jointly and submit them together to
the criticism of our party.
<p>On the basis of what was said above and having been inspired by classical
texts produced by revolutionary militants, we want to lay emphasis on our
historical conception of the revolutionary destruction of the state. We
affirm:
<ul>
<li>
that between the capitalist society and the communist society, there lies
a period of transformation of one into the other, during which the state
<b>can
be nothing but</b> the revolutionary dictatorship of the proletariat (the
despotic destruction of the commodity producing society);</li>

<li>
that this state is obviously formed not in the name of liberty, but it
is based on the necessity to subdue its adversaries and to destroy the
dictatorship of the rate of profit, which rules the capitalist society;</li>

<li>
that, exactly for these reasons, (as it contains its self-dissolution),
this state is not a state in the traditional meaning of the expression
(1).</li>
</ul>

A long time before the first social-democratic parties formally constituted
themselves, the antagonism between revolution and counterrevolution had
already been crystallized around the question of the state, and especially
around the program which aimed at setting the state more free. Indeed,
at the time of the so-called "French revolution", while republicans of
all kinds called to set the state more free and proclaimed the political
rights and defended the citizens' liberty, revolutionaries defined this
liberty on the level of the state as a lie for the exploited; already at
this time they affirmed that any kind of liberty of the state, all formulations
of equality and liberty as regards rights, mean absolutely nothing <b>from
a social point of view</b> and that the political liberation is a bourgeois
tale aiming to perpetuate exploitation and social oppression.
<p>During the so-called "French revolution", when the distinction between
the bourgeois program, the reformist program for workers, the social-democratic
program regarding the liberty of the state and the revolutionary program
generated and affirmed by the proletariat in its struggle was already clearly
marked.
<p>For example, Buonarroti in his book <i>"Conspiracy for Equality"</i>
explains that those who took part in the revolutionary conspiracy (<i>"the
friends of Equality"</i>) knew that a constitution, does not matter how
democratic it is, could not guarantee happiness, and thus, first of all,
it was indispensable to <i>"destroy the contradiction established by our
institutions [...] and to drag out of the natural enemies of Equality the
means to deceive, to frighten and to divide: [...] finally, they knew,
and since the experience has too long already justified their outlook,
that to establish the constitutional order of elections without these preliminaries,
means to abandon the power to the friends of all abuses, and to lose forever
the opportunity to assure public happiness."</i> Following this Buonarroti
adds this significant note: <i>"As long as things will stay as they are,
the most free political form will be advantageous only for those who can
do without work..."</i> (2)

<font face="Comic Sans MS">oOo</font></h2></center>
We are now going to quote some key paragraphs of the program approved by
the <i>Gotha Congress of the German Workers' Party</i>. The Gotha Congress
took place from 22nd to 27th May, 1875 and it marked the constitution of
the German social-democracy into a big "Marxist" mass party (3). It was
this party which was to become the model for social-democracy of the whole
world. This organization - henceforth called <i>Socialist Workers' Party
of Germany</i> - is the result of the fusion operated at this Congress
between the <i>Social-Democratic Workers' Party of Germany</i>, the so-called
"Marxists", or eisenachians, controlled by Bebel and Liebknecht, and the
<i>General
Association of the German Workers</i>, the lassallian organization led
by Hasenclever, T&ouml;lcke and others (4).
<blockquote><i>"The working class strives for its emancipation first of
all
<b>within the framework of the present-day national states</b>, conscious
that the necessary result of its efforts, which are common to the workers
of all civilized countries, will be the international brotherhood of peoples."</i></blockquote>

<blockquote><i>"Starting from these basic principles, the German Workers'
Party strives by all legal means for the <b>free state</b> and socialist
society..."</i></blockquote>

<blockquote><i>"The German Workers' Party, in order to <b>pave the way
to the solution of the social question</b>, demands the establishment of
producers' co-operative societies with <b>state aid under the democratic
control of the toiling people</b>."</i></blockquote>

<blockquote>-excerpts from the Programme of the German Workers' Party,
1875-</blockquote>
It is obvious that the key of the bourgeois policy for workers invariably
consists of the will to integrate the proletariat into the state. In the
same way, the emancipation is not conceived as a rupture with the bourgeois
order as a whole, but as a rupture with something internal to the "setting
of the present national state", according to the German Workers' Party.
Even the evident conceptual confusion, which is peculiar to all social-democratic
formulations regarding the state, is part of the strategy which attempts
to subsume the proletariat in a policy which maintains it within the framework
of the state. Not only the fact that the state is the organised power of
the dominant class is ignored and masked, but the ambiguity about its nature
is also maintained, and as a result, it is always obscure if one speaks
about the governmental apparatus or about a country, about a given situation,
a given state or about the present society: the terms "present national
state" synthesize all these confusions because they try to trap the proletariat
in a national policy and to maintain its division by countries. These programmatical
ambiguities and confusions constitute the ideological antecedent of the
later Marxist-Leninist conceptions peculiar to "socialism in only one country",
to workers' state (degenerated or not), to the people's states and more
generally, to all the people's democratic republics which came into being
during this century in Russia, in China, in Eastern Europe, in Albania,
in Cuba, in Korea,... This is the reason for the importance of the revolutionary
criticism on this question made by the revolutionary party all along its
history.
<p>The official program of social-democracy insists on:
<blockquote><i>A. "The free basis of the state".</i>
<br><i>B. "The German Workers' Party demands as the intellectual and ethical
basis
of the state: 1. Universal and equal elementary education by the state..."</i></blockquote>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">oOo</font></h2></center>
Facing these windy discourses on the way to set the state more free, more
popular, more democratic,... all the revolutionaries of the time reacted.
<p>First of all, and independently of the programmatical disagreements
we might have with Bakunin, we want to underline the excellent criticism
this comrade made about the social democratic conception of people's and
free state; it was an open, violent, lucid and public criticism, which
even inspired Marx and Engels.
<blockquote><i>"Between a monarchy and the most democratic republic there
is only one essential difference: in the former, the world of officialdom
oppresses and rabs the people for the greater profit of the privileged
and propertied classes, as well as to line its own pockets, in the name
of the monarch; in the latter, it oppresses and robs the people in exactly
the same way, for the benefit of the same classes and the same pockets,
but in the name of the people's will. In a republic a fictitious people,
the 'legal nation' supposedly represented by the state, smothers the real,
live people. But it will scarcely be any easier on the people if the cudgel
with which they are beaten is called the people's cudgel."</i></blockquote>

<blockquote>-M.Bakunin, <i>Statism and Anarchy</i>, Cambridge University
Press, page 23-</blockquote>
The clarity of these programmatical affirmations marks out the uneven way
of the constitution of the proletariat into a revolutionary party opposed
to all bourgeois state; they decisively pave the way for the criticism
of democracy, people's republic and political liberty.
<blockquote><i>"This means that no state, howsoever democratic its forms,
not even the reddest <u>political</u> republic - a people's republic only
in the sense of the lie known as popular representation - is capable of
giving the people what they need: the free organization of their own interests
from below upward, without any interference, tutelage, or coercion from
above. That is because no state, not even the most republican and democratic,
not even the pseudo-popular state contemplated by Marx, in essence represents
anything but government of the masses from above downward, by an educated
and thereby privileged minority which supposedly understands the real interests
of the people better than the people themselves."</i></blockquote>

<blockquote>-M.Bakunin, <i>Statism and anarchy</i>, idem, page 24-</blockquote>
Bakunin rigorously criticised all kinds of state and particulary the democratic
conceptions of people's and free state. He unfortunately mixed this understanding
with a nationalist and racist vision of the events, which would inevitably
lead him to consider some races as statist and others as non-statist; he
placed the affirmations of social democracy regarding people's and free
state, in the framework of a German statist plot. Bakunin, considering
Marx and Engels as the powerful chiefs of this party (cf. bellow), attributed
to them erroneously the whole of the bourgeois policy of the German social
democracy, a policy for which they were not even responsible, but never
stopped to criticize. However, Marx and Engels, definitely due to opportunism,
didn't make public their criticisms, and they never overtly proclaimed
their rupture with social democracy, which rupture they announced in private
so many times (5); this reality undoubtedly contributed to the origin of
Bakunin's false opinion, and to the development of the confusion. The result
of all these was that the real class divisions between the social democratic
and the revolutionary positions, between the partisans of the free state
and those who strived for the abolition of the state, remained hidden behind
the quarrels of chapels between the Marxists and the Bakuninists, between
"the authoritarians" and "the anarchists", or even between different nationalist
and racist currents: behind the opposition between the "historical peoples"
on one hand, and the Slavic and Latin on the other.
<p>But let's come back to the real rupture between revolution and counterrevolution,
to the criticism made by revolutionaries in opposition to the social democratic
programme aimed at reforming the state on liberal and democratic bases:
<blockquote><i>"Is this not new evidence of that truth which we never tire
of asserting, in the conviction that the quickest resolution of all social
problems depends on its universal comprehension: that the state, any state,
be it vested in the most liberal and democratic forms, is necessarily based
on domination, on force, that is, on despotism - covert, perhaps, but all
the more dangerous?"</i></blockquote>

<blockquote>-M.Bakunin, <i>Statism and anarchy</i>, idem, page 34-</blockquote>
Similar to the criticism made by Marx and Engels, Bakunin's criticism starts
from the destruction of the idea of the emancipation of the state. Just
like the one of Marx and Engels, his analysis takes its strength from the
criticism of the people's and free state. But Bakunin had the courage to
clearly and publicly position himself outside and against social-democracy.
He understood its historical function (perfectly understanding its total
antagonism with the IWA) and defined social-democracy as it really is:
a mere bourgeois party for workers.
<blockquote><i>"[...] emancipation of the proletariat is absolutely impossible
within the framework of any state, and that the primary condition for achieving
it is to destroy every state. That is possible, however, only through concerted
action by the proletariat of all countries, whose organization first on
an economic basis is precisely the object of the International Working
Men's Association. [...]</i></blockquote>

<blockquote><i>But the Austrian workers did not take these necessary first
steps because they were brought to an abrupt halt by the propaganda of
Liebknecht and the other social democrats who came with him to Vienna,
I believe in July of 1868. Their objective was to direct the true social
instinct of the Austrian workers away from the path of international revolution
and toward political agitation for the establishment of a unified state,
which they term <u>popular</u> but which obviously means pan-German - in
short, for the realization of Bismarck's patriotic ideal but on a social-democratic
basis and by means of so-called legal popular agitation.</i></blockquote>

<blockquote><i>It is not just the Slavs who should refuse to take this
path but the German workers as well, for the simple reason that the state,
be it called popular ten times over and embellished with the most highly
democratic forms, will necessarily be a prison for the proletariat. [...]
Therefore we will refrain from urging our Slavic brothers to join the ranks
of the Social Democratic Party of the German workers, which is led first
and foremost by Marx and Engels in a kind of duumvirate vested with dictatorial
power, with Bebel, Liebknecht, and a few Jewish literati behind them or
under them. On the contrary, we must exert all our efforts to dissuade
the Slavic proletariat from a suicidal alliance with this party, which
is in no way a popular party but in its orientation, objective, and methods
is purely bourgeois and, furthermore, exclusively German, that is, lethal
to the Slavs.</i></blockquote>

<blockquote><i>The more energetically the Slavic proletariat, for its own
salvation, must reject not just alliance but even rapprochement with this
party - we do not mean with the workers who belong to it but with its organization
and particularly its leadership, which is bourgeois through and through
- the more closely, likewise for its own ssalvation, it must join forces
with the International Working Men's Association. The German party of social
democrats should by no means be confused with the International (6). The
political and patriotic program of the former not only has almost nothing
in common with the program of the latter but is even totally opposed to
it."</i></blockquote>

<blockquote>-M.Bakunin, Statism and anarchy, idem, pages 49/51-</blockquote>
Like so many other revolutionary comrades, Bakunin was clearly aware that
the more liberal, popular and democratic the declarations regarding the
state are, the more counterrevolutionary the actions of the party which
formulates them are. He perfectly understood that the more liberal and
democratic a legislation or a constitution are, the more powerful the state
which puts them forward is.
<blockquote><i>"[...] they become out [...], all the more dangerous to
the people the more liberal and democratic their public pronouncements."</i></blockquote>

<blockquote>-M.Bakunin, <i>Statism and Anarchy</i>, idem, pages 52/53-</blockquote>

<blockquote><i>"One would have to be an ass, an ignoramus, or a madman
to imagine that any kind of constitution, even the most liberal and democratic,
could modify this relationship of the state to the people for the better."</i></blockquote>

<blockquote>-M.Bakunin, <i>Statism and anarchy</i>, idem, page 62-</blockquote>
When he denounces here these liberal and democratic forms of domination,
Bakunin rightly insists on the fact that not only they do not limit the
dictatorship and the despotism at all, but they even make them more powerful.
<blockquote><i>"At that time no one even suspected the truth which has
now become obvious even the most stupid despots, that so-called constitutional
forms, or forms of popular representation, do not impede state, military,
political, and financial despotism Instead, they have the effect of legalizing
it and giving it a false appearance of popular government, and they can
significantly enhance its internal strength and vigor."</i></blockquote>

<blockquote>-M.Bakunin, <i>Statism and anarchy</i>, idem, page 114-</blockquote>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">oOo</font></h2></center>
As for Marx, he (and to a certain extent Engels) would develop this same
criticism of the free and people's state. Very early, he would criticize
the conception of liberty linked with the state according to which man
frees himself while freeing the state: (<i>"[...] the state can be a free
state without man being a free man"</i>) (Karl Marx, <i>On the Jewish question</i>,
1843 (7)). Consequently, having read the Gotha Programme, Marx immediately
launched a furious criticism of the conception which economically and socially
underlies this program, concentrating this criticism on the famous "free
state":
<blockquote><i>"First of all, according to the 2nd article, the German
Workers' Party strives for 'the free state'.</i></blockquote>

<blockquote><i>Free state -- what is this?</i></blockquote>

<blockquote><i>It is by no means the aim of the workers, who have got rid
of the narrow mentality of humble subjects, to set the state free. In the
German Empire, the 'state' is almost as 'free' as in Russia(8). Freedom
consists in converting the state from an organ superimposed upon society
into one completely subordinate to it; and today, too, the forms of state
are more free or less free to the extent that they restrict the 'freedom
of the state'.</i></blockquote>

<blockquote><i>The German Workers' Party -- at least if it adopts the program
-- shows that its socialist ideas are not  even skin-deep; in that, instead
of treating existing society [...] as the basis of the existing state [...]
it treats the state rather as an independent entity that possesses its
own intellectual, ethical, and libertarian bases.</i></blockquote>

<blockquote><i>And what of the riotous misuse which the program makes of
the words 'present-day state', 'present-day society', and of the still
more riotous misconception it creates in regard to the state to which it
addresses its demands?</i></blockquote>

<blockquote><i>'Present-day society' is capitalist society, which exists
in all civilized countries, more or less free from medieval admixture,
more or less modified by the particular historical development of each
country, more or less developed. [...]</i></blockquote>

<blockquote><i>Nevertheless, the different states of the different civilized
countries, in spite or their motley diversity of form, all have this in
common: that they are based on modern bourgeois society, only one more
or less capitalistically developed. They have, therefore, also certain
essential characteristics in common. In this sense, it is possible to speak
of the 'present-day state' in contrast with the future, in which its present
root, bourgeois society, will have died off.</i></blockquote>

<blockquote><i>The question then arises: What transformation will the state
undergo in communist society? In other words, what social functions will
remain in existence there that are analogous to present state functions?
This question can only be answered scientifically, and one does not get
a flea-hop nearer to the problem by a thousand-fold combination of the
word 'people' with the word 'state'."</i></blockquote>

<blockquote>-K.Marx, <i>Critique of the Gotha Programme</i>-</blockquote>
Like Bakunin and all the revolutionaries of yesterday and today, Marx denounced
the strive to set the state more free or more popular. He refuted that
by ornamenting the word state with these adjectives, one comes closer one
iota to the solution of the problem and, finally, he clearly opposed the
communist position to the bourgeois democratic solution of the people's
and free state:
<blockquote><i>"Between capitalist and communist society there lies the
period of the revolutionary transformation of the one into the other. Corresponding
to this is also a political transition period in which the state can be
nothing but the <b>revolutionary dictatorship of the proletariat</b>."</i></blockquote>

<blockquote>-K.Marx, <i>Critique of the Gotha Programme</i>-</blockquote>
By the same occasion Marx denounced the claims of social-democracy as a
part of the old bourgeois program - the democratic program -, a programm
already achieved in capitalist society. Otherwise, it is fully revealing
to note that already at this time the concepts, the objectives, the "program"
of social-democracy came from the idealization of democracy, the idealist
improvement of what that already existed in the bourgeois world at the
time:
<blockquote><i>"Now the program does not deal with this [dictatorship]
nor with the future state of communist society.</i></blockquote>

<blockquote><i>Its political demands contain nothing beyond the old democratic
litany familiar to all: universal suffrage, direct legislation, popular
rights, a people's militia, etc. They are a mere echo of the bourgeois
People's Party, of the League of Peace and Freedom. They are all demands
which, insofar as they are not exaggerated in fantastic presentation, have
already been realized. Only the state to which they belong does not lie
within the borders of the German Empire, but in Switzerland, the United
states, etc. This sort of 'state of the future' is a present-day state,
although existing outside the 'framework' of the German Empire."</i></blockquote>

<blockquote>-K.Marx, <i>Critique of the Gotha Programme</i>-</blockquote>
But social-democracy as a national party of conciliation of the classes
was even not consistent with this bourgeois program, and it didn't even
act as a radical bourgeois democratic party. It is obvious, as W.Liebknecht
himself would later confirm it from the parliament, that this party had
never been a revolutionary party but a party of reforms. It was besides
the essence of social-democracy which manifested itself there: It promised
to the rest of the bourgeois parties that it would achieve its aspiration
for the free state by legal means: <i>"[...] the German Workers' Party
strives
<b>by all legal means</b> for the free state"</i> (Gotha Programme).
<p>Marx denounced democratism and legalism, opposing them to the old revolutionary
position recalling that the class struggle will be resolved by violence
and by the force of weapons.
<blockquote><i>"Since one has not the courage [...] to demand the democratic
republic [...] one should not have resorted, either, to the subterfuge
[...] of demanding things which have meaning only in a democratic republic
from a state which is nothing but a police-guarded military despotism,
embellished with parliamentary forms [...]; and then to assure this state
into the bargain that one imagines one will be able to force such things
upon it 'by legal means'!</i></blockquote>

<blockquote><i>Even vulgar democracy, which sees the millennium in the
democratic republic, and has no suspicion that it is precisely in this
last form of state of bourgeois society that the class struggle has to
be fought out to a conclusion -- even it towers mountains above this kind
of democratism, which keeps within the limits of what is permitted by the
police and not permitted by logic."</i></blockquote>

<blockquote>-K.Marx, <i>Critique of the Gotha Programme</i>-</blockquote>
Then Marx attacked the other political claims of bourgeois socialism peculiar
to this <b>free state,</b> for which social-democracy aspired so much.
He insisted on the fact that these demands were nothing but the "good side"
of a miserable bourgeois society <b>already existing</b>. He thus revised
and put into another context the different claims in which the words <b>"liberty"</b>
and
<b>"popular"</b> appeared: progressive taxes,
<b>"liberty of science"</b>,
<b>"liberty
of conscience"</b>, "popular, general and equal education"... all those
things had already been achieved by the bourgeois state:
<blockquote><i>"That, in fact, by the word 'state' is meant the government
machine, or the state insofar as it forms a special organism separated
from society through division of labor, is shown by the words 'the German
Workers' Party demands as the economic basis of the state: a single progressive
income tax', etc. Taxes are the economic basis of the government machinery
and of nothing else. In the state of the future, existing in Switzerland,
this demand has been pretty well fulfilled. Income tax presupposes various
sources of income of the various social classes, and hence capitalist society.
It is, therefore, nothing remarkable that the Liverpool financial reformers
-- bourgeois headed by Gladstone's brotherr -- are putting forward the same
demand as the program."</i></blockquote>

<blockquote>-K.Marx, <i>Critique of the Gotha Programme</i>-</blockquote>
Then, opposing the thesis of the German Workers' Party, that revindicates
<i>"[...]
demands as the intellectual and ethical basis of the state: 1. Universal
and equal elementary education..."</i>, Marx says:
<blockquote><i>"Equal elementary education? What idea lies behind these
words? Is it believed that in present-day society (and it is only with
this one has to deal) education can be equal for all classes? Or is it
demanded that the upper classes also shall be compulsorily reduced to the
modicum of education -- the elementary school -- that alone is compatible
with the economic conditions not only of the wage workers but of the peasants
as well?</i></blockquote>

<blockquote><i>'Universal compulsory school attendance. Free instruction.'
The former exists even in Germany, the second in Switzerland and in the
United states in the case of elementary schools. [...]</i></blockquote>

<blockquote><i>'Elementary education by the state' is altogether objectionable."</i></blockquote>

<blockquote><i>-K.Marx, Critique of the Gotha Programme-</i></blockquote>
Marx denounces the intention of social-democracy to <i>"appoint the state
as the educator of the people"</i>.
<blockquote><i>"'Freedom of science' says paragraph of the Prussian Constitution.
Why, then, here?</i></blockquote>

<blockquote><i>'Freedom of conscience'! If one desired, at this time of
the Kulturkampf to remind liberalism of its old catchwords, it surely could
have been done only in the following form: Everyone should be able to attend
his religious as well as his bodily needs without the police sticking their
noses in. But the Workers' party ought, at any rate in this connection,
to have expressed its awareness of the fact that bourgeois 'freedom of
conscience' is nothing but the toleration of all possible kinds of religious
freedom of conscience from the witchery of religion. But one chooses not
to transgress the 'bourgeois' level."</i></blockquote>

<blockquote>-K.Marx, <i>Critique of the Gotha Programme</i>-</blockquote>
The concept of the free state is the synthesized expression (9) of all
these particular bourgeois liberties and, that is to say, of the bourgeois
liberty strictly speaking, the liberty of exchange, the liberty of private
property, the liberty to exploit, the liberation of work as we said in
the main text about liberty. Therefore it is totally logical that the Gotha
Programme also praises the liberation and emancipation of work, an apology
historically resulting from a
<b>correction/revision</b> of the sentence
of the <i>Communist Party Manifesto</i> pleading for the emancipation of
the working class. Marx and Engels evidently criticize this claim of the
social-democracy too.
<blockquote><i>"[come then] the windy discourses about the `liberation
of work' instead of the emancipation of the working class, because work
is nowadays too much free!"</i></blockquote>

<blockquote>-Letter of Engels to Bebel, 12th October 1875 - [Our translation]</blockquote>
Considering now the totality of the program, Marx concludes that it is
nothing but a conciliation between the faith in democracy and the faith
in the state, which is in total opposition to the interests of the proletariat
and its revolutionary program:
<blockquote><i>"But the whole program, for all its democratic clang, is
tainted through and through by the Lassallean sect's servile belief in
the state, or, what is no better, by a democratic belief in miracles; or
rather it is a compromise between these two kinds of belief in miracles,
both equally remote from socialism."</i></blockquote>

<blockquote>-K.Marx, <i>Critique of the Gotha Programme</i>-</blockquote>
Engels will also criticize the program and the party stemming from Gotha:
<blockquote><i>"[...] the principle of internationalism of the worker's
movement is, to all intents and purposes, utterly denied [...].</i></blockquote>

<blockquote><i>[...] as its <b>one and only social</b> demand, the program
puts forward the Lassallean state aid in its starkest form, as stolen by
Lassalle from Buchez. [...] Our party could hardly demean itself further
(10)! Internationalism sunk to the level of Amand Goegg, socialism to that
of the bourgeois republican Buchez, who <b>confronted the socialists</b>
with this demand in order to supplant them!"</i></blockquote>

<blockquote>-letter of Engels to Bebel, 18-28th March 1875-</blockquote>
The <b>free people's state</b> also constitutes the central target of Engels'
criticism:
<blockquote><i>"The free people's state is transformed into the free state.
Grammatically speaking, a free state is one in which the state is free
vis-&agrave;-vis its citizens, a state, that is, with a despotic government.
All the palaver about the state ought to be dropped, especially after the
Commune, which had ceased to be a state in the true sense of the term (11).
The people's state has been flung in our teeth ad nauseam by the anarchists,
although Marx's anti-Proudhon piece ['Misery of philosophy' NoR] and after
it the Communist Manifesto declare outright that, with the introduction
of the socialist order of society, the state will dissolve of itself and
disappear (12). Now, since the state is merely a transitional institution
of which use is made in the struggle, in the revolution, to keep down one's
enemies by force, it is utter nonsense to speak of a free people's state;
so long as the proletariat still
<b>makes use</b> of the state, it makes
use of it, not for the purpose of freedom, but of keeping down its enemies
and, as soon as there can be any question of freedom, the state as such
ceases to exist. We would therefore suggest that Gemeinwesen ['commonalty']
be universally substituted for state; it is a good old German word that
can very well do service for the French 'Commune'."</i></blockquote>

<blockquote>-letter of Engels to Bebel, 18-28 March 1875-</blockquote>
Engels, after having expressed his complete opposition to the totality
of the program, announces, with Marx, that they will assume their responsibilities
publicly, which, as it is known and mentioned above, they will never do
for completely blameworthy reasons of opportunity. In the same way, they
will not make a public criticism of social-democracy and its program either,
which will permit until today the perpetuation of the amalgam between Marx/Engels
and social-democracy:
<blockquote><i>"I shall desist, although almost every word in this program,
a program which is, moreover, insipidly written, lays itself open to criticism.
It is such that, should it be adopted, Marx and I could never recognise
a new party set up on that basis and shall have to consider most seriously
what attitude -- public as well as private -- we should adopt towards it.
Remember that abroad we are held responsible for any and every statement
and action of the German Social-Democratic Workers' Party. E.g. by Bakunin
in his work 'statehood and Anarchy', in which we are made to answer for
every injudicious word spoken or written by Liebknecht since the inception
of the 'Demokratisches Wochenblatt' [the democratic newspaper published
in Leipzig from 1868 to 1869 under Liebknecht's leadership NoR]. People
imagine that we run the whole show from here, whereas you know as well
as I do that we have hardly ever interfered in the least with internal
party affairs [...]. But, as you yourself will realise, this program marks
a turning-point which may very well force us to renounce any kind of responsibility
in regard to the party that adopts it."</i></blockquote>

<blockquote>-Engels' letter to Bebel, 18-28th March 1875-</blockquote>

One can see in this letter, like in the whole correspondence of Marx and
Engels of that time, that Bakunin's correct and powerful criticism of the
social-democratic practice and the conception of the free state had an
enormous influence on Marx and Engels. On the other hand, while reading
without prejudices the texts against the state written by Marx and Engels,
as well as<b> </b>by Bakunin, one will notice <b>the existence of decisive
programmatical coincidences</b>; despite the fact that the political divergences
were at that time in full development, typical divergences of a period
of defeat and of the unavoidable sectarian renewal coming with this phase.
Unfortunately the convergences existing between these revolutionary militants
won't resist sectarianism, and soon the whole movement will be weakened
by hate and fratricidal struggle between groups of militants to be supressed.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>We are not going here into the details of this polemic and we are not
going to tackle the rough falsifications made by the different fractions
of the social-democratic party (from the republican "anarchists" to the
democratico-popular "communists") either, but we want to affirm that what
has been said about this polemic, what has been popularized under the form
of a division between the marxists and the anarchists is profoundly
<b>false</b>.
This false polarization finds its source in the sectarian vision mutually
addressed by these militants. Thus, Bakunin's point of view criticizing
a populist and democrat Marx who didn't exist, was completed by Marx's
vision about Bakunin: a Bakunin in continuous dissolutive (and populist)
alliance with all kinds of bourgeois organizations (like the famous League
for Peace and Liberty), a Bakunin with a reformist project aiming "to abolish
class differences" instead of the classes themselves... A more serious
study of Bakunin would demonstrate that he never was the populist, the
democrat or the anti-authoritarian that official "anarchism" made of him
afterwards (and they even made a republican of him); a scrupulous investigating
would, on the contrary show that he was a systematic partisan of internationalist
organisational structures with a clearly revolutionary program. Moreover,
as all genuine revolutionaries, he was induced by the very movement to
admit and assume the necessity of dictatorship to put an end to capitalism;
even if, unlike Marx and Engels, who always overtly claimed the latter
as dictatorship of the proletariat, Bakunin was in favour of a more conspiratorial,
secretive and elitist conception of the revolutionary dictatorship:
<blockquote><i>"Like invisible pilots in the middle of the popular storm,
we must lead it, not by a conspicuous power, but by the collective dictatorship
of all <b>allies</b>. Dictatorship without any presidential sashes, without
any title, without any official rights. This dictatorship will be the most
powerful since it will not have any of the appearances of power." (13)</i></blockquote>

<blockquote>-Letter of Bakunin to Richard, 1st April 1870 - [Our translation]</blockquote>
The weight of the historic falsification carried out by social-democracy
about the division between marxists and anarchists is enormous, but we
will finish these critical commentaries while rather insisting on <b>the
common content of the attacks carried on by revolutionaries against the
free state</b>. Indeed, what is fundamentally of interest for revolutionaries
stands beyond the denunciation of this falsification, beyond the explanation
of the real polemic.
<p>It would be easy for us to oppose to the "anarchist" and "communist"
ideological families, in a provocative but at the same time very illustrated
way, the total opposition of what is generally said. This way one could
criticize Marx - completely against the current of common affirmations
- because of his <b>"libertarian and sponttanist"</b> aspect which led him
in an irresponsible way to consider, shortly after his war with Bakunin,
that the party of the proletariat didn't need an international formal organization
any more and that the dissolution of the IWA was necessary. In the same
way, one could linger over the completely <b>"partitist"</b> character
of Bakunin, which drove him to adopt a fractionist policy inside this very
International (14). But from the point of view of the affirmation of the
revolutionary program, <b>the general antagonism between reforming or destructing
the state</b> is a more fundamental reality. And this is not by chance
that precisely this antagonism is pushed into the background by the different
social-democratic tendencies, while promoting the Marx/Bakunin polemic.
<p>Therefore, in opposition to this eclipse, what we want to emphasize
here is that Marx, Bakunin and a lot of revolutionary militants of the
time criticized the concept of the free and people's state of social-democracy
and that this critique drove them naturally to affirm (certainly still
in a confused and embryonic form) the necessity of the <b>revolutionary
dictatorship and the destruction of all state</b>.
<p>Of course also here, in the affirmation of this necessity of revolutionary
dictatorship, there is a qualitative difference between Marx and Bakunin,
even if once again, one can find positions which are in complete opposition
to what is generally said. Usually, Marx is presented to us as a supporter
and Bakunin as an enemy <u>of politics</u>. It is true that some aspects
of their polemic took this form and used this terminology. But the reality
is completely different. Marx understands the dictatorship of the proletariat
as a <b>social and historical</b> necessity to abolish the society of Capital,
a necessity in which the subjective, voluntary, political action is materially
determined and must be proclaimed openly. And vice versa, the so-called
apolitical attitude of Bakunin, combined with his non-recognition of the
social dictatorship of the proletariat and his rejection of the historic
necessity of the dictatorship as a social question (against the law of
the value), leads him to a completely voluntarist, secret and therefore
politicist conception of the dictatorship and the party.
<blockquote><i>"[...] and to save the revolution, to carry it off successfully,
in the middle of this anarchy, the action of a collective, invisible dictatorship,
which doesn't assume any kind of power and due to this it is more efficient
and more powerful, the natural action of energetic and sincere socialist
revolutionaries scattered on the surface of the country and of all countries,
but greatly united by a common thought and a common will."</i></blockquote>

<blockquote>Bakunin's letter to Richard, 12 March 1870 - [Our translation]</blockquote>
But it's clear that also in these affirmations, and despite the divergences,
Bakunin stood on our side of the barricade: he organized, led, affirmed
<b>will
and conscience</b> as the key of the party and revolution (15), he defended
the necessity of direct action of revolutionary militants ("our small party",
as he said in some documents) to <b>lead the revolution</b>.
<p>After these precisions, let's remain once again, beyond these divergences
through which one always try to overlook the main thing, that what was
the most important at the time, was that
<b>the proletariat developed a
community of program and struggle </b>which crystallized among others in
the practical and theoretical actions of militants like Marx, Bakunin and
a lot of others.
<p>It is not the inconsequencies of Marx or Bakunin that are really crucial
in this phase of historic affirmation of the proletariat. Of course, it
would be incorrect to pass over the lack of clarity of Marx in silence,
as for his rupture with social-democracy, a lack of clarity which would
lead him to lots of programmatical limps incoherent with his revolutionary
theory (for example, the question of universal suffrage, national liberation,
or also German formal social-democracy); in the same way, one must evidently
denounce the politicist practices of Bakunin which would lead him to contradict
in practice the decisive elements of the revolutionary theory (for example,
his attempt to abolish the state with a decree adopted at the time of the
seizure of the town hall of Lyon or his total lack of public rupture with
the League for Peace and Freedom). What is really crucial, beyond all these
oscillations peculiar to a period where the proletariat tries to distinguish
itself from the social-democracy by its revolutionary practice, is the
fact that an open struggle exists, pushing this rupture and the clarification
of this historical antagonism. The goal of this struggle, as it is widely
expressed in Marx's, Engels's, Bakunin's texts and also by other internationalist
militants of those years, is <b>the constitution of the proletariat into
an historic force antagonist to all established order, the total rupture
with bourgeois democracy and therefore with all the parties of social-democracy;
its aim is the organization of the party of the revolution for the total
destruction of capital and the world state.</b>
<p>It is very precisely in this framework and at this historical level
of our Party that <u>our criticism of the liberty of the capitalist world,
our criticism of the free state</u>, of the people's state... stands. It
is precisely at this level that the contributions of these old comrades
stands (who are not to be considered as idols) comrades who developed the
first systematizations of the historical antagonism between the social-democratic
solution (the free, people's, democratic state) and the revolutionary solution
of the question of the state: <b>revolutionary dictatorship of the proletariat
to destroy the commodity producing society and abolish all state </b>(16).
<h3>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">Notes</font></u></h3>
1. In all precapitalist social formations, as well as under capitalism,
the state, as the armed organization of authority, as the power which enables
the extended reproduction of the mode of social production and exploitation,
is par excellence a power of self-perpetuation. The capitalist state, as
the power of the united bourgeoisie, has the function of perpetuation of
capitalism, maintenance of capitalists as a class, and thus it has the
function to sustain itself. The proletariat, on the contrary, in its social
war for the destruction of capitalism, not only contains the negation of
capitalism, but <b>its own negation</b> too. For this reason, the proletarian
"state" <b>is not a state</b> in the traditional sense of the expression,
as it also includes its own dissolution, its own extinction. It is the
active negation of the dictatorship of the capital, and thus it is the
negation of all kinds of dictatorship and state.

[Conspiracy for the so-called Babeuf's Equality - Our translation], Les
Classiques du Peuple, Editions Sociales, pages 45 and 46.
<p>3. It is necessary to clarify two things here. First, we use the term
"Marxist" in the sense of the dissection, disintegration of Marx's work
and in the meaning of the elaboration of a Marxist ideology, as an ideology
of the bourgeois state for workers. This ideology contains the apology
for labour, economic centralization, nationalizations, democratic institutions,
etc. Second, this official and mass formation of social-democracy is not
the first manifestation of social-democracy as the bourgeois party for
the workers. In fact, social-democracy
<u>as the conception and historic
party of counterrevolution</u> is a more global phenomenon, and its historical
origin much preceded the formalisation of the party about which we speak
here. As soon as the proletariat strived to become emancipated from the
bourgeoisie, tried to place itself outside and against its domination,
the bourgeois attempts to constitute parties for the workers also started
to develop. These parties were prepared to use any means at all in order
to promote a policy which is diametrically opposed to the interests of
the proletariat: a policy of submission to nations, to democracy, to alliances,
to fronts, to the realization of democratic and/or national tasks... Thus,
long before that the social-democratic party came into existence in the
form it adopted in 1875 in Germany, its various formal expressions had
already appeared in several countries.
<p>4. It is necessary to know that the program of social-democracy presented
here, whose main writer was the "Marxist" W.Liebknecht, governed the life
of this organization for more than 15 years on, until the Halle Congress
on 16th October, 1890 recommended the writing of a new program project.
This task was accomplished shortly after, and the new program was ratified
in Erfurt in 1891.
<p>5. Marx, for example, affirms in a letter to Bracke: <i>"After the Coalition
Congress Engels and I will publish a short declaration and say that we
have nothing to do with this programme of principles."</i> (Marx's letter
to Bracke, 5th May, 1875) Under the absurd pretext that both classes of
the society considered it as a real revolutionary and even communist programme,
though it was nothing else just a bourgeois democratic programme, Marx
and Engels didn't make public their rupture with it. <i>"But donkeys of
the bourgeois newspapers took this program seriously, they read what was
not there and interpreted it as communist. The workers seem to do the same.
[Our translation until here] <b>It is this circumstance alone</b> which
has made it possible for Marx and myself not to disassociate ourselves
publicly from a programme such as this. So long as our opponents as well
as the workers continue to read our views into that programme, we are justified
in saying nothing about it."</i> (Engels' letter to Bebel, 12th October
1875). It was an enormous political mistake, because while basing themselves
on "what people think of it", Marx and Engels especially refrained from
saying what it was. The proletariat and its vanguard minorities paid a
gigantic price for this silence.
<p>6. Bakunin mistakenly believed that the German socialist party was represented
by Marx and Engels in the International, but he was right when he described
social-democracy as a bourgeois national party, and he was also correct
when claiming that in reality this party of social-democracy opposed the
International not only programmatically but also all the attempts to practically
organise with the International. Indeed, the joining/adhesion of the left-wing
of this party to the International was merely formal (one only speaks here
about Bebel and Liebknecht, since the others didn't even sympathized with
the workers' International). As Engels said in a letter to T.Cuno of 7th/8th
March 1872: <i>"The position of the German Workers' Party in relation to
the International was never clear. There were only some merely platonic
relations, there was never a real adherence, not even from isolated people
(despite some exceptions)..."</i> [Our translation] After recalling that
no sections were ever constituted because it was legally forbidden, Engels
insisted on the fact that <i>"in Germany, they limited themselves to claim
the rights of members (of the International NoR) without supporting the
duties..."</i> [Our translation]
<p>7. In the same text Marx adds: <i>"But, the attitude of the state, and
of the <b>free state</b> in particular, to religion is, after all, only
the attitude to religion of <b>the men</b> who compose the state. It follows
from this that man frees himself through the medium of the state, that
he frees himself politically from a limitation when, in contradiction with
himself, he raises himself above this limitation in an abstract, limited,
and partial way."</i> (K.Marx, <i>On the Jewish question</i>)
<p>8. Marx ridicules here the claiming of the free state, while affirming
that in Germany one is almost as "free" as in Russia, which means, if you
take into account the following sentence and the understanding Marx had
of the European reality of that time, that in Germany the government was
practically as despotic as the regime in Russia, which was considered at
that moment as the despotism par excellence. It is noteworthy that Marx
was attentive enough to put this "liberty" of the "state" into inverted
commas, to oppose it to the real liberty which begins where the "liberty
of the state" is limited (or more essentially, when the state doesn't exist
any more).
<p>9. We do not think that it is correct to affirm that the free state
is the supreme level of all these liberties. It is clear that the liberty
of work, resulting from the liberty achieved by the historic separation
of the producer and his means of production, constitutes the main determination.
<p>10. Engels denounces the Socialist Workers' Party of Germany stemming
from Gotha because of its practice and program, and he defines it as a
democratic party, a bourgeois party, a party of conciliation with the state...
but while qualifying this organization as "our party" (!), he makes an
extremely serious concession which has, still today, innumerable and immeasurable
practical consequences.
<p>11. Reading the programs of social-democracy and all of its epigones,
one can never exactly decide about which situation (pre- or post-revolutionary)
one is speaking, which state (bourgeois state or proletarian semi-state)
it is about (cf. for example the Trotskyist transition program). This is
why Engels found himself first obligated to criticize the free state as
a bourgeois state while showing that this one is necessarily despotic;
and it is only after that he talks about the post-revolutionary "state",
while specifying that it is not a "state" in the sense this term is usually
used by social-democracy and including those who proclaim themselves "anarchists".
<p>12. Facing Marxism-Leninism which invented socialism embracing commodity,
money, the law of value and "the Workers' state", it is fundamental to
emphasize the disappearance of the state, about which Engels speaks here,
and to restore the ABC of the conception of the proletarian revolutionary
dictatorship which aims to set up a social regime without commodity, without
private property, without value,... a socialist social system which made
itself superfluous and allows the extinction, the disappearance of the
state.
<p>13. This affirmation of a secret and powerful dictatorship made here
by Bakunin is not an exception in his militant life; it is rather permanent
feature of all his "alliancist" period, contrary to the legend claiming
that it was his most anti-authoritarian period. One can only understand
that if one knows Bakunin's general practice, a practice marked by innumerable
degrees of the organization and the program, where very open populist levels,
and extremely clandestine levels are in juxtaposition; these latter are
clearly partisans of internationalism and revolutionary socialism, on basis
of a completely disciplined and hierarchical organisation. It is for example
the case of the organization of Y., that is structured on the basis of
a set of categories which go from the international brothers to the local
alliances. Bakunin establishes that <i>"all lower categories (must) be
organized in a way that they always obey, all the more in fact than of
right, the direction which will be given to them by the upper categories."</i>
-M.Bakunin, "Programme of Y [of the internnational fraternity]" - [Our translation],
Oeuvres compl&egrave;tes, vol.6, Ed. Champ Libre, page 186.
<p>14. Guy Debord in <i>"The society of the spectacle"</i> is one of the
rare militants who understood, at least partially, the sense of the polemic
between Bakunin and Marx. Cf. the fourth part of this book (<i>"The proletariat
as subject and as representation"</i>) and in particular thesis 91 of which
we reproduce here a short excerpt: <i>"Marx thought that the growth of
economic contradictions inseparable from democratic education of the workers
would reduce the role of the proletarian state to a simple phase of legalizing
the new social relations imposing themselves objectively, and denounced
Bakunin and his followers for the authoritarianism of a conspiratorial
elite which deliberately placed itself above the International and formulated
the extravagant design of imposing on society the irresponsible dictatorship
of those who are most revolutionary, or those who would designate themselves
to be such."</i>
<p>15. There are some partitists -particularly among the bordiguists- who
believe that Bordiga was the first to affirm the party as a fact of <b>conscience
and will</b>!
