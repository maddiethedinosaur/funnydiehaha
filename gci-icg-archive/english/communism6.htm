<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">Alienation and primitive communism</font></u></h2>
Contrary to the petty Puritanism of those bourgeois scientists who, for
centuries, have been describing the primitive societies as unspeakable
monstrosities, as beastly societies, not human yet, evoking pictures of
barbarian dragging their women by the hair and unchristian love, "Quest
of fire"-style,... revolutionary Marxism analyses these primitive societies
as being natural communities, as being primitive communism. Where those
narrow-minded pen pushers see nothing but barbarism, we see the expression
of "what is human in man" (Marx), that is, societies which ignore the separations
between labour and leisure, education and pleasure, man and nature, life
and death,... real communities where there is no class, no state, no private
property, no family,... where the communal being of man is nothing else
but man himself, where the atomised individual, so cherished nowadays,
does not exist, where the community corresponds to the interests of the
species.
<p>"In natural and primitive communism, even if humanity is kept within
the bounds of the horde, the individual does not seek to steal from his
brother's welfare, and he is ready to sacrifice himself fearlessly for
the survival of the great phratry." - Bordiga, "In Janitizio we do not
fear death" -
<p>And despite all the trash spread around by our "professors", it is getting
clearer and clearer that these primitive societies, this natural communism,
were societies of abundance in which, moreover, there existed rites for
the redistribution of riches, for the destruction of surplus (e.g. the
"potlatch" amongst the Iroquois...) (2).
<p>Yet, if we regard primitive communism as an embryonic prefiguration
of the future human community, it is nevertheless true that this community
was still imperfect and limited (we do not intend to revive the myth of
"paradise lost") because it was strictly subordinated to the external natural
conditions, inclement weather, melting ice, earthquakes,... which at times,
caused scarcity and therefore the necessity to produce stores, to accumulate.
The dissolution of natural community through exchange - brought about,
on one side, by the accumulation of surplus for exchange, and on the other
side by scarcity (the first and essential scarcity being historically that
of women) - first takes place on the outskirts of the community, and then
causes more and more strongly the gathering and hunting societies to become
agricultural/stock-breeding societies, which means: production for exchange,
emergence of value and then of money as a medium of exchange, expropriation
of men, division of labour, division into classes etc., in short, the destruction
of primitive communism and the emergence of class societies and the State
as the organ defending the interests of the ruling class - a process summed
up here in a few lines, but which actually lasted thousands of years.
<p>Alienation, in the Marxism sense of dispossession, or more precisely
extraneousness (3) appears along with the dissolution of the primitive
society, but, in these societies, prior to this extraneousness there existed
an alienation: natural alienation. This natural alienation is of course
qualitatively different from the alienation/extraneousness such as it is
developed in class societies and culminates - absolute domination - in
the capitalist mode of production. Indeed, natural alienation derives from
the necessity to explain, to understand natural phenomenon which seem unconceivable
and unearthly, and which determine the whole life of the community. That
is why all the cults, myths, divinities,... in these communities refer
to the essential elements of human life, of reproduction of the species:
fecundity, sun, life, moon, fire,...
<p>"Religion, as the word tells it, is a relation between the beings. It
appears only when the activity of men has been fragmented, just as their
community has been fragmented. It makes use of the rituals, the magic,
the myths of previous societies. Before that, there was no religion." -
Camatte, "On alienation" in "Capital and Gemeiwesen -
<p>That is also why these myths, these rituals,... expressions of the primitive
communal life, represent much more an outline of human consciousness than
of a false, mystified consciousness: religion.
<p>"The myth, in its innumerable forms, was no delirium from minds which
had their physical eyes closed to reality - natural and human reality in
an inseparable way as in Marx - but it is an irreplaceable step on the
only way towards the real conquest of consciousness which, in class forms,
is built through large and distant revolutionary rending, and which will
develop freely in the classless society only (...). Well, these myths and
these mystiques were a revolution; the respect and admiration that we show
for them, as struggles constituting rare and remote movements forward through
which human society progressed, are in no way lessened, for us, by the
fact that their formulations are awkward and those of our doctrine have
another texture." - Bordiga, "Comments on the Economic and Philosophical
Manuscripts" B
<p>Though these phenomenon are by no means understood consciously, the
primitive man finds a solution for them, a mystical reason; but this mystification
is not external to life, is not inhuman - reality is merely distorted,
mystified by the very limits of the primitive man. The alienation has still
a human character. The representations of primitive life - which have become,
in value societies what they call "art" - even when distorted by the mystique,
are not yet totally separated from life itself, "art" is not yet the lifeless
representation of survival, because there still exists an art of living.
<p>The dissolution of the community, just as it means separation among
men, brings about all the separations; alienation becomes purely inhuman.
The stronger the development of the several kinds of class societies, the
stronger the dispossession of man, his material dispossession, hence that
of his consciousness.
<p>"In the form of exchange, of money and of classes, all sense of the
perenniality of the species disappears, while the sordid sense of the perenniality
of saving arises, embodied in the immortality of the soul which acquires
its felicity outside nature, with an usurious god managing this odious
bank. In these societies that pretend that they have raised themselves
from barbarism to civilization, one fears personal death and one prostrates
oneself before infamous mummies, even like the mausoleums in Moscow." -
Bordiga, "In Janitzio we do not fear death" -
<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">Reification and capitalism</font></u></h2>
The worldwide domination of capitalism is radically different from all
the previous modes of production, with its universal essence as a precondition
to the unification of the history of humanity. Capitalism is not just the
product of the simple linear succession of the modes of production, which
preceded it in such or such geographical area; its presupposition is the
world market. Thus the capitalist mode of production is the first worldwide
mode of production - the only one that destroys and unifies all the other
modes of production which co-existed before (feudalism, slavery-system,
Asiatic mode of production,...) and at the same time makes of communism
a possibility and a necessity. Capitalism thus synthesizes and simplifies
the class antagonisms, which have made the entire human prehistory; the
fundamental contradiction now lies between capitalism and communism, between
bourgeoisie and proletariat.
<p>In this contradiction the proletariat is the negating pole, the art
of destruction. And whereas capitalism sums up the history of the ruling
classes, the proletariat sums up and makes possible the everlasting struggle
of the exploited classes (cf. Spartacus, T.Munzer, the Anabaptists, the
Enrages, the Levellers, etc.) (4). Therefore, as Marx says, if "the propertied
class and the class of the proletariat present the same human self-estrangement",
it is the proletariat only that embodies, that personifies, in destitution,
the revolt against this destitution, "a revolt to which it is necessarily
driven by the contradiction between its human nature and its condition
of life, which is the outsight, resolute and comprehensive negation of
that nature." - Marx, "The holy family" -
<p>Capitalism, which concludes the cycle of value (in generalizing to the
whole world the commodity production - formula M-C-M'), sets the serf free
from his last fetter - the tie to the glebe -; but, just as it frees him
from this tie to the ground, it breaks the last link that still bound man
to nature, and which, moreover, enabled him to subsist, since, in the feudal
social relations, one part of the serf's labour-power was owed to himself,
the other part being owed to the lord. The free serf - that is, the modern
proletarian - is thus left with his labour-power and his children as his
only property (5).
<p>"Light, air and the simplest animal cleanliness cease to be human needs.
Filth, this corruption and putrefaction which runs in the servers of civilization
(this is to be taken literally) becomes the element in which he lives."
- Marx, "Economic and Philosophical Manusscripts" -
<p>It is in, and through, this total destitution that the proletariat finds
out its destructive power; having nothing to lose, it has everything to
win. As Lenin said: "What we want: everything". Here we find again, in
the utmost atomisation of the "proletarian citizen", in his "liberation",
the base of the community of capital, the negation of classes: democracy
(6).
<p>"Feudal society was dissolved into its basic element, man; but into
egoistic man who was its real foundation. Man in this aspect, the member
of civil society, is now the foundation and presupposition of the political
state. He is recognized as such in the rights of man. But the liberty of
egoistic man and the recognition of this liberty is rather the recognition
of the frenzied movement of the cultural and material elements, which form
the content of this life. Thus man was not liberated from religion; he
received religious liberty. He was not liberated from property; he received
the liberty to own property. He was not liberated from egoism of business,
he received the liberty to engage in business." - Marx, "On the Jewish
Question" 1843 -
<p>The emancipation, the liberation achieved by the bourgeois society is
thus the liberty to be fully exploited, the complete dispossession of the
proletarian is his liberty to be forced to sell his labour-power, in order
not to starve. This constrained act of sale/purchase of human labour marks
the completion of the historical process of dehumanisation. Alienation/extraneousness
is total; man is nothing but a mere commodity, a dead thing. Man's alienation
is wage-labour, alienated labour, alienation of labour. It is this act
of sale - commodity exchange - that totally separates the workers, the
producer from the means of production. He is compelled to sell himself,
in order to be able to value himself with means of production which are
alien and external to him though they actually are nothing but crystallized
human labour.
<p>"The worker puts his life into the object and this life then belongs
no longer to himself but to the object. The greater his activity, therefore,
the less he possesses. What is embodied in the product of his labour is
no longer his own. The greater this product is, therefore, the more he
is diminished. The extraneousness of the worker in his product means not
only that his labour becomes an object, assumes an external, but that it
exists independently, outside himself, and alien to him, and that it stands
opposed to him as an autonomous power. The life which he has given to the
object sets itself against him as an alien and hostile force." - Marx,
"Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts" -
<p>The product of labour is, therefore, an object alien to the worker,
which dominates him. The worker does not dominate the machine; it is capital,
the social relations, the wage slavery that dominate the worker's life
in a totalitarian way. Thus the capital social relations appear too as
an external, alien, somehow "natural" power that dominates the proletarians
and which, furthermore, seems eternal. What is more, alienation of labour
also means that work is not a natural need to which worker submits willingly,
quite the contrary, since it is the only way for him to satisfy his vital
needs. Thus the historical struggle of the proletarians against alienation
is their struggle against work (7).
<p>"The external character of work for the worker is shown by the fact
that it is not his own work but the work for someone else, that in work
he does not belong to himself but to another person. It is the loss of
himself." - Marx, Id. -
<p>Yet, at the same time, this "loss of himself" makes it materially possible
for the worker to become aware of this loss, to struggle, to destroy this
wage slavery system.
<p>"That is to say, it is true that the worker is objectively transformed
into a mere object of the process of production by the methods of capitalist
production (in contrast to those of slavery and servitude) i.e. by the
fact that the worker is forced to objectify his labour-power over against
his total personality and to sell it as a commodity. But because of the
split between subjectivity and objectivity induced in man by the compulsion
to objectify himself as a commodity, the situation becomes one that can
be made conscious. In earlier, more organic forms of society, work is defined
'as the direct function of a member of the social organism' (Marx, "A contribution
to the critique of Political Economy"): in slavery and servitude the ruling
powers appear as the 'immediate mainsprings of the production process'
and this prevents labourers enmeshed in such a situation with their personalities
undivided from achieving clarity about their social position. By contrast,
'work which is represented as exchange value has for its premise the work
of the isolated individual. It becomes social by assuming the form of its
immediate antithesis, the form of abstract universality.' (...). Above
all the worker can only become conscious of his existence in society when
he becomes aware of himself as a commodity. As we have seen, his immediate
existence integrates him as a pure, naked object into the production process.
Once this immediacy turns out to be the consequence of a multiplicity of
mediations, once it becomes evident how much it presupposes, then the fetishistic
forms of the commodity system begin to dissolve: in the commodity the worker
recognizes himself and his own relations with capital. Inasmuch as he is
incapable in practice of raising himself above the role of object his consciousness
is the self-consciousness of the commodity, or in other words, it is the
self knowledge, the self-revelation of the capitalist society founded upon
the production and exchange of commodities." - Lukacs, "Reification and
the consciousness of the proletariat", Merlin Press -
<p>This long quotation explains the permanent and tendency-like process
that goes from "the self-consciousness of the commodity" among the atomised
proletarians, from "non-class", up to the constitution of the class into
"class for itself", the conscious class organized into a party (8).
<p>Thus we have seen that the essential characteristic of the capitalist
mode of production lies in the fact that:
<p>"In the first place, it produces commodities. But that does not distinguish
it from other modes of production; it is rather that the prevailing and
decisive feature of this production is to be a production of commodities.
That implies first that the worker himself appears only as seller of commodities,
hence as a free wage labourer and therefore that labour appear essentially
as wage labour... The main agents of this mode of production, the capitalist
and the wage-labourer, are as such mere embodiments, mere personifications
of Capital and Wage Labour." - Marx, "Capital", Book One -
<p>It is therefore the commodity that determines life; in order to exist
under capitalism, everything must posses the characteristic of a commodity,
that is, the quality of exchangeability: to possess an exchange value (9),
in addition to its support, use value. The human labour power thus becomes
something alien to man, a commodity, a mere dead, inhuman thing: this is
objectification. From this, it ensues that for the proletarians:
<p>"The relations connecting the labour of one individual with that of
the rest appear, not as direct social relations between individuals at
work, but as what they really are, material relations between persons and
social relations between things." - Marx, "Capital", Book One -
<p>Under capitalism, man is but what he brings, what he possesses as value
to exchange. Money totally replaces the community, for the only thing that
men have in common is their possession of a more or less great sum of money.
It is money that connects the separated, extraneous beings; their relation
is totally inhuman, is monetary. It is under the form of money that capital
appeared historically. Money is the universal mediation; everything must
become money (see Marx - Grundrisse, The Chapter on Money -). An example
of this community of money is marriage which - beyond the discourses upon
crazy love and love at first sight - is nothing but the sharing, with a
monetary contract, of... misery. "Money is itself the community and can
tolerate none other standing above it" (Marx).
<p>Thus the worker appears as the owner of the commodity-labour power,
and he sells himself, as a thing, with it. The process of extraneousness
is therefore twofold: it appears first through the separation between the
human forces and the products of their creators' labour, and then with
their autonomization; the consequence of this is: the man is dominated
by the material objective form of his own labour (10). Thus the fetishist
character of the commodity is unveiled: every social, human relation under
capitalism must assume the characteristic of a commodity (11), and therefore
appears as a relation among dead, non-human things.
<p>"Because the relation of the producers to the sum total of their own
labour is presented to them as a social relation, existing not between
themselves, but between the products of their labour. (...) There it is
a definite social relation between men that assumes, in their eyes, the
fantastic form of a relation between things. (...) This I call fetishism
which attaches itself to the products of labour, so soon as they are produced
as commodities, and which is therefore inseparable from the production
of commodities." - Marx, "Capital" Book One -
<p>The general characteristic of the capitalist mode of production lies
in the fact that the production of relations among men settles not only
for things, but, above all, by means of things. The commodity (and its
fetishist character) being the obligatory mediation of all production,
all the relations among men, and especially those between proletarians
and bourgeois, are being veiled, mystified extraneous. The general form
of this phenomenon is reification. And this relation among reified men
is itself represented by a personified relation - personification of the
capitalist production relations - with, on the one hand, the capitalist,
and on the other hand, the proletarian - both being expressions of the
bourgeois social relation.
<p>"Economy does not deal with things, but with relations among persons
and, in the last instance, between classes; now these relations are always
connected with things and appear as things." - Engels, "About Marx's Critique
of Political Economy" -
<p>We shall have to decompose artificially, into two parts, the whole process
of reification, in order to grasp its distinct yet inseparable elements:
<p>A) Reification is the process through which the capitalist production
relations (which determine the relations among men, essentially between
capitalists and proletarians) bestow a definite social form, or definite
social characteristics, upon the things by means of which men enter into
mutual relations. This is objectification.
<p>B) What enables the owner of things having a definite social form to
appear in the personified form of capitalists, and to enter into concrete
production relations with other men. This is personification.
<p>In other words, under the capitalist mode of production, the relations
among men assume the general character of a commodity - exchange value,
exchangeability - and therefore become reified relations, relations among
things - sale of labour power for a wage. But these reified relations which
have become external, dominating things (simply because they seem to have
proprieties "of their own") are themselves personified by the capitalists,
"living" representatives of a relation among dead things. "The capitalist
is merely capital personified" (Marx, Capital). And of course, the fetishist
character of the commodity reaches its highest point with value, which
begets itself, with money begetting money. Money possesses the inhuman
gift of begetting "in itself" still more money, just as an apple-tree begets
apples. The entire process is obturated; reification is absolute; nothing
is left of man. This is the realm of things: money, machines, labour, leisure,...
capital. This is the realm of death.
<p>The reification of the production relations is thus reinstated in the
central position that Marx already attributed to it in his theory of value,
in his "necrology of the capitalist mode of production": Capital.
<p>"Already implicit in the commodity (...) is the reification of the social
features of production and the personification of the material foundations
of production, which characterize the entire capitalist mode of production"
-Marx, Capital, Book Three-
<p>And of course, the entire "work" of "Marxist" economists consists in
separating "the objective and scientific analysis of capital" from the
remnants of "Hegelian philosophy" - the central question of reification
- which, according to them, still obscuree the analysis. This falsification
has only one purpose: trying to prove that Marx's gigantic work is but
a mere analysis - biology - of capital, and not the implacable demonstration
("the terrible missile") of the unavoidable catastrophic collapse of capitalism,
of its violent destruction by the personification of the entire human poverty:
the proletariat which, by this very act, liberates humanity from the realm
of necessity and man from alienation.
<p>"Vulgar economists who do not understand that the process of 'personification
of things' can be comprehended only as the result of the process of 'reification
of production relations' among men, regard the social characteristics of
things (value, money, capital,...) as natural characteristics inherent
in things themselves. Value, money,... are not considered as expressions
of human relations "connected" with things, but as the direct characteristics
of things themselves, characteristics which are 'directly intermingled'
with their natural, technological characteristics. There lies the fetishism
of the commodity that characterizes vulgar economy and the common views
of the agents of production, entrapped in capitalist economy. Here lies
'the reification of social relations, the immediate interconnection of
the material production relations with their historico-social determinations'."
- "Capital", Book Three, quoted by L. Rubbin -
<p>We therefore had to restore the theory of reification at the very centre
of the totality that Marxism - "the theory of the conditions of liberation
of the proletariat" (Engels) - is. This essential conception, according
to which the very motive power of human liberation lies in the fact that
the proletariat is itself totally made extraneous, totally dominated by
a monstrous heap of lifeless objects - expressing that life is objectless
-makes it possible for us to understand aand describe what integral communism
will be.
<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">Integral communism: the world human community</font></u></h2>
The vulgar comprehension always shows contempt for communism, on behalf
of immediacy, that is, on behalf of domination by capital. Revisions are
always justified by "new conditions", by "special cases", by "changes in
the evolution of capital", failing to understand that our movement, the
workers' struggle, is not subordinated to such or such incidental change
in the domination of capital, but to communism in a direct and invariant
way. It is only from the standpoint of communism that revolutionaries can
transform reality. It is the totality of the historic cycle - from natural
communities to integral communism - that determines the revolutionary program,
which the working class will carry on. This movement is taking place under
our eyes; it is the negation of capitalism by the proletariat, which, in
negating itself - negation of the negation - realizes the human community.
That is why the whole of Marx's work, as well as that of all revolutionaries,
is also the description of communism. That description of communism is
the description of what the humanity will be historically compelled to
achieve - the human community - and at the same time, the description of
the concrete action of the proletariat, of the communist movement, which
will impose communism. Thus it is also the description of the new community
in its prefiguration: the party. Marx's classical description of communism
was as follows:
<p>"Since human nature is the true community of men, by manifesting their
nature men create, produce the human community, the social entity, which
is no abstract universal power opposed to the particular individual, but
is the essential nature of each individual, his own activity, his own life,
his own spirit, his own wealth". - Marx, Comments on J. Mill -
<p>Once the human community, the "true community" is defined, it is easier
for us to comprehend the fictive character (12) of the commodity of capital,
of a pseudo-community, of a real community of extraneous, self-estranged
men.
<p>"To say that man is estranged from itself, therefore, is the same thing
as saying that the society of this estranged man is a caricature of the
real community, of his true species-life, that his activity therefore appears
to him as a torment, his own creation as an alien power, his wealth as
poverty, the essential bond linking him with other men as an unessential
bond, and separation from his fellow men, on the other hand, as his true
mode of existence, his life as a sacrifice life, the realization of his
nature as making his life unreal, his production as the production of his
nullity, his power over an object as the power over him, and he himself,
the lord of his creation, as the servant of this creation". - Marx, Comments
on J. Mill -
<p>And, as we have seen, from the negation of capitalism by the proletariat
negating itself, Marx draws the positive description of communism:
<p>"Communism is the positive abolition of private property, of human extraneousness,
and thus the real appropriation of human essence through and for man. It
is therefore the complete return of man himself as a social, i.e. really
human being, a complete and conscious return which assimilates all the
wealth of previous development."
<p>"Communism as a fully developed naturalism is humanism and as a fully
developed humanism is naturalism. It is the definitive resolution of the
antagonism between man and nature, and between man and man. It is the true
solution of the conflict between existence and essence, between objectification
and self-affirmation, between freedom and necessity, between individual
and species. It is the solution of the riddle of history and knows itself
to be this solution."
<p>Communism means the realization of the human species, means the destruction
of the petty, infamous bourgeois individual: "Communism suppresses the
individual to realize the human being." (Le Communiste No.9) (13)
<p>The suppression of the particular individual on behalf of the species
also means the disappearance of egoism:
<p>"Need and enjoyment have thus lost their egoistic character and nature
has lost its mere utility by the fact that its utilization has become human
utilization." - Marx, Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts -
<p>All the separations disappear along with the abolition of private property,
classes, money, labour, the State (and all its apparatus: justice, schools,
armies, churches,...) but also of the basic structure of the bourgeois
society: the family (with its hypocritical panoply: cuckolds, prostitutes,
lovers,...), to be replaced by a human community which assumes, in a communal
way, the entire life and reproduction of the species.
<p>"We have the right to follow the century - old thesis - no wage, no
money, no exchange, no value - with thesis quite as century - old and original:
no god, no state, no family." - Bordiga, The Immuable Tables of the Communist
Theory -
<p>In this sense, love is no longer what we "know" today - the fusion of
two atomised beings (a fusion which means their non-existence) sharing
their misery and their anguish but the assuagement and development of all
the desires, impulses, longings, needs,... of the social man.
<p>"In a non-monetary communism, love will have, as a need, the same importance
and meaning for both sexes, and the act which consecrates it will achieve
the social formula according to which the other's need is my need as a
man insofar as the need of one sex is being fulfilled as one need of the
other sex." - Bordiga, Comments on the Economic and Philisophical Manuscripts
B
<p>"I would have been for you the mediator between you and the species
and therefore would become recognised and felt by you yourself as a completion
of your own essential being and as a necessary part of yourself, and consequently
would know myself to be confirmed both in your thought and your love. In
the individual expression of my life, I would have directly created your
expression of your life, and therefore in my individual activity I would
have directly confirmed and realised my true being, my human being, my
communal being." - Marx, Comments on J.Mill, 1844 -
<p>Likewise, time under capitalism is one of the monsters, which consumes
us every day, for the reason that time is the measure of value; it is time
that quantifies value. Under capital, time is the only social measure;
it is the standard according to which our non-life is calculated. Everything
is determined by labour-time; and as the famous saying goes: "Time is money".
Marx already conveyed this idea when he wrote: "Time is everything, man
is nothing; he is, at most, time's carcass".
<p>"The pendulum of the clock has become as accurate a measure of the relative
activity of two workers as it is of the speed of two locomotives." - Marx,
The poverty of Philosophy, 1846 -
<p>Under capitalism, time is the measure of our loss; we are losing our
time to win our survival. On the contrary, communism will abolish all measure
by time, for it will abolish what time measures: the value production.
All the decisions leading to communism counteract the law of value; hence
destroy the foundation of the capitalist production relation (14).
<p>"In a future society, in which class antagonism will have ceased, in
which there will no longer be any classes, use will no longer be determined
by the minimum time of production, but the time of production devoted to
an article will be determined by the degree of its social utility." - Marx,
The poverty of Philosophy -
<p>Communism will not take, as a basis, labour-time (=capital), but the
available time, the free disposal of one's life, hence of time. It will
no longer be necessary to fight in order to 'take one's time for living',
since our lives will take place all the time.
<p>It remains to be known whether, for us communists, communism means "the
end of the history", means the realization on earth of the celestial paradise
which all priests promise us. Here as elsewhere, let the classics answer:
<p>"Communism posits the positive as negation of the negation and is, consequently,
for the next stage of historical development, a real and necessary factor
in the emancipation and rehabilitation of man. Communism is the necessary
form and the dynamic principle of the immediate future, but communism is
not itself the goal of human development, the form of human society." -
Marx, Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts -
<p>Causing once more idealists as well as vulgar materialists to fidget,
Marx here asserts that communism is but a transitory society, is not the
end of history, but, on the contrary, the beginning of the human history,
of the conscious history; it is just the end of the prehistory. Communism
is the suppression of class antagonism and its consequences. It is not
the suppression of all contradiction, that is, of all movement. The social
humanity will still be in movement, a movement no longer determined by
class contradictions but for the very first time by new contradictions,
human contradictions at last. Communism is the dawning of a new era, is
the reappropriation by the humanity of its history, its consciousness,
as well as all of its riches.
<p>From the primitive man's natural alienation to the citizen's extraneousness
under capitalism: that is how the cycle of class societies is completed,
the cycle of the still more alienated quest for abundance. Whereas communism,
being "the supremacy of man over his conditions of living" (Marx, The German
Ideology), abolishes alienation...

<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">Notes</font></u></h3>
(1) The general framework of study, the central question of the Marxist
method, that is, how Marxism abolishes philosophy (and economy, science,
art as well) by realizing it, is to be found in our text "Notes critiques
sur le mat&eacute;rialisme dialectique" in Le Communiste No.13.
<p>(2) For readers interested in these questions, we refer to Engel's classic
"The Origin of the Family, Private Property, and the State" as well as
to the text "Abundance and Destitution in Primitive Societies" (published
in the review "La Guerre Sociale" No.1) which, though sometimes verges
on the apology of the natural community, is nonetheless a very good illustration
of the essential human character of primitive societies - and that from
the communist standpoint.
<p>(3) This essential concept in Marx, restored by Camatte, enables us
to express more accurately the worker's complete dispossession, man's total
externality to his production.
<p>"We therefore translated 'Entfremdung' with extraneousness, thus modifying
the word coined, with good reason, by Hippolyte. In effect: it cannot be
translated with alienation, for this would mask reality, or more precisely,
veil the moment which alienation has reached. Now the term implies that
man has become a stranger to himself, to his Gemeinwezen, and that his
activity estranges him more and more, and removes him farther and farther
from his human reality. This is a very important stage in the development
of the capitalist society. The ultimate one is reached when atomised social
relations, made independent by capital, dominate the human being whose
activity was their original generator. There it is reification, which inevitably
produces the complete in mystification of reality." (Invariance)
<p>(4) It is obvious that the proletariat only can carry out this old project
of the humanity, the communists from the past had their eyes turned to
the past, and intended to revive the ancient community (cf. Spartacus'
City of the Sun) because they had not the material possibility yet to impose
the new human community, integral communism.
<p>(5) Hence the word 'proletarian': from prole = child - that is, he who
only possesses his children.
<p>(6) On this subject, we refer our readers to our text "Fasciste ou anti-fasciste,
la dictature du capital c'est la d&eacute;mocratie" in Le Communiste No.9,
and "Against the Myths of Democratic Rights and Liberties" in Communism
No.1.
<p>(7) See our text "A bas le travail" in Action Communiste No.4.
<p>(8) The extreme position of the proletariat as a "non-class" reveals
its existence "for capital" only, its complete atomisation, its dissolution
into the people. The utter domination of the counter-revolution through
purified democracy - fascist or anti-fascist - has almost completely achieved
this negation of the classes during the period before WW II (see Bilan).
As for us, we prefer to use the concept of "non-class", instead of the
"classical" term "class-in-itself", because it shows more precisely that
the distinction between "class-in-itself and "class-for-itself" expresses,
on the one hand, the inexistence of the proletariat as a revolutionary
class - a class in the full sense of the term, that is, organized into
a party - and, on the other hand, its affirmation as such.
<p>(9) Here, of course, we distinguish the form that value takes under
capitalism (exchange value) from the substance of value: abstract labour.
<p>(10) On all these questions, we refer the reader to the book by F. Jakubowski
"The ideological superstructures in the materialist conception of history",
which is not devoid of critics.
<p>(11) The first sentence of "Capital" already synthesizes this reality:
"The capitalist mode of production presents itself as 'an immense accumulation
of commodities'".
<p>(12) When we define the community of capital as a fictive community,
we mean that it is fictive as a community, as "the essence of man" but
is completely real as a community of atomised citizens, as a non-human
community. The fictive community of capital exists; we must therefore destroy
it.
<p>(13) When we assert this central position of revolutionary communism,
in direct relationship with Marx's and Bordiga's works - The human being
is the true Gemeinwezen of man - we consider, like Bordiga, that "in this
grand construction, economical individualism is abolished, and the social
man emerges, whose limits are those of the human society, or better, of
the human species." Yet this essential, impersonal, anti-individualistic
conception -man exists only as social man, as human species - also means
the realization of the "particular" man, of what is human in each man.
The suppression of the individual - the narrow-minded, stupid and egoistic
individual - means the realization of the social man, hence the complete
realization of each "particular" man. "The danger with Bordiga lies in
that he maintains his thesis on the negation of the individual up to communism
included; in negating man as a unity, communism eventually appears as the
triumph of the species only." - Camatte, Bordiga and The Passion for Communism
-
<p>(14) We are not dealing, within the framework of this article, with
the question of the "labour coupons" in the period of transition - a highly
incidental proposal made by Marx in his critique of the Gotha program.
Nevertheless, we can briefly assert that the very problem of labour coupons
must be set aside, since they still are a form of measure of labour made
extraneous by time. On the contrary, integral communism means the suppression
of labour, hence its measure. The immediate measures decided by the worldwide
dictatorship of the proletariat should be directed towards communism, should
run counter the law of value, hence directed towards the abolition of labour
- for example, the drastic shortening of  labour time. These measures, instead
of being the implementation of a new mode of calculation of labour by time,
such as the labour coupons, shall counteract capital's logic and shall
therefore correspond to the reappropriation by the proletariat of the whole
of the social production - for instance, measures such as: free transports,
free lodgings, free health cares,... Marx's proposal - the labour coupons
-though quite anachronic in view of the ppresent technological development,
had at least the great advantage of being put forth from a communist standpoint,
in contradistinction to capitalist development; that is not the case, far
from it, of all his "successors" and "interpreters" for whom communism
is but capitalism seasoned with some democratic reforms...
<p>On this subject, we refer our reader to the debate between Bilan and
the Group of Internationalist Communists from Holland (G.I.K.) in Bilan
No.19 and 20, and to the text "Communism and the Measure by Labour Time"
in La Guerre Sociale No.1.
<p>(15) Contrary to Hegel who, being a perfect idealist, puts an end to
his dialectic, hence to history (a finality of the human history which
has been attained with the ideal embodied by the German State), Marx maintains
the dialectic and history up until the end as the motive power, and therefore
do not consider communism as the end of the movement, the end of all human
development.

of an article that was first published in our Spanish review "Comunismo"
(No.22 - June 86).</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Although the events that the article talks
about are not of recent date, the article remains very "up to date" as
this was shown, cynically, a few months ago when the very commander of
the massacres of June 86 at the El Fronton prison, M. Agustin Mantilla,
took office as the Home Secretary of the new Peru government. This is how
the bourgeoisie celebrates the massacres of the proletariat and how it
honours and promotes its bloodthirsty butchers! M. Agustin Mantilla, "homme

APRA party) is also known to be one of the organisers of the different

<font face="Comic Sans MS">oOo</font></h2></center>
"Patria mia dame un presidente como Alan Garcia" ("Motherland give me a
president like Alan Garcia"), the posters implored, in several Latin-American
countries.
<p>Alan Garcia, the first president from the APRA - a party that had for
decades represented Latin-American bourgeois anti-imperialism - had edged
his way through international conferences with progressists and trotskyists
from all sides - (let us not forget the flirt between Haya de la Torre
and Trotsky himself), and thus appeared as the trump card of Great Motherland
nationalism and social-democrat anti-imperialism in Latin-America.
<p>But international social-democracy (as numerous facts of the workers'
struggle have shown) can offer nothing to the proletarians but State terrorism,
repression, torture, shootings, massacres,... And the same can be told
of any anti-imperialist, nationalist project, of any variety of Great Motherland
nationalism, which is always essentially bourgeois.
<p>Mister Garcia could not be, and has never been any exception. Cheered
up by international social democracy and all the progressist bourgeois,
Mister Garcia, once he had taken over the presidency, could play the cynical
part of deceitful, politicking duelling, typical of any anti-imperialist
bourgeois and populist nationalist. He built his fame among his international
partners upon one or two purges in the repressive apparatus (so as to perfect
repression, of course), upon anti-imperialist boastings, like when he announced
that he would not devote more than 10% of the country's foreign currency
to the payment of the external debt. Some even talk of "Garcia doctrine"
about the payment of the debt! It is obvious that all that idle talk never
stopped his regime from being on very good terms with the main international
financial circles or international institutions like the IMF, the World
Bank or the Interamerican Bank for Development. In all these institutions,
there existed a kind of unanimous obligingness towards that man who was
doing his best to deceive Peru's and Latin America's proletarians with
the myth of debt repayment; and when the tension grew between the creditors
and those in debt, they all agreed that Alan Garcia should pay a much larger
sum in bribes. At bottom, they were aware that the 10% story suited them
very well, but first and foremost, the myth had to live on.
<p>Since there was nothing else for them to do in front of a proletariat
that was marching on, they did the same about repression. They went chattering,
they sacrificed a few scapegoats among the civil servants, and of course,
they went on repressing. The number of people tortured, imprisoned, murdered
in prison (an impressive massacre took place on the 4th October 1985 in
Lurigancho, where dozens of prisoners were shot and burnt alive), disappearing,...
not only did not decrease, but actually increased.
<p>And of course, people like Willy Brandt, Mitterand, Guillermo Ungo,
Felipe Gonzalez, Olof Palme,... participated and were accomplice in this.
As a matter of fact, they were still welcoming and paying tribute to their
fellowman Alan Garcia as being a true progressist and true anti-imperialist.
Actually, Alan Garcia does embody international progressism, nationalist
anti-imperialism and social-democratism: bloodthirsty against the fighting
proletariat, one thousand times murderer of all the social struggles. The
international press - that loathsome dissembler of all crimes committed
by the State - was doing the rest: Alan was America's "Felipe Gonzales",
the fairest and youngest of all the presidents of Latin-American democracy;
he even was photogenic and his image could be sold as that of a "good family
man". Welcome to the show! Meanwhile, repression was more sanguinary than
ever; but, internationally, they mentioned it the least often possible,
and when they did, the right or the left of the world bourgeoisie justified
repression like this: "the point, actually, is to repress a tiny group
of fanatics, of polpotians,...".
<p>The impressive and sanguinary massacre of subversive prisoners that
took place on the 18th of June 1986 in "El Fronton", "Lurigancho" and "Santa
Barbara" in Peru, is a logical consequence of all this international preparation.
It is the golden prize of anti-imperialist progressism. The fact that at
the same time in Lima, the congress of the Socialist International was
taking place, with peace as the major theme of it (as Willy Brandt even
declared when he got to Lima: "We are ready to lend a helping hand for
peace and for a solution to the economical problems that affect the world")
might be interpreted by some as a mere coincidence, or as the result of
Shining Path's revolt (Shining Path's appreciation that in those conditions
the terrorist State repression against them, would be more difficult!).
For us, beyond all these interpretations, there is an obvious link of unity
between the social-democrat scheme of peace and the massacres of imprisoned
proletarians. Since Reagan had several times emphasized that the Peruvian
guerrilla was the most threatening of the world, the social democrats had
to show once more that when the system is in danger, they can be more sanguinary
than all the sanguinary ones in the world. The competition between the
right and the left, beyond the different economic interests that they represent,
reveals itself in the mechanism of control and of repression of the proletariat.
What does it matter, that later they establish one or one thousand commissions
of inquiry to charge those responsible for the "excesses" (!)... such cynical
play is part of the natural mechanisms of bourgeois domination and oppression.
Even though they plan and decide of the military operations, they always
find alibis, and to preserve the credibility of the State, they sacrifice
such and such of their colleagues whom they find "guilty" of these "excesses",
of these "violations of the human rights". About Vietnam, for instance,
the Yankee State, which considered napalm and chemical warfare as parts
of the murdering game, nevertheless preferred to condemn a few scapegoats
for these "excesses". And Mitterrand - about whom they forget cleverly
that he was among the leaders of the massacres in Algeria - who affords
himself the luxury of an inquiry to "seek out those who commanded bomb-layers
for the "Rainbow Warrior" whereas he himself was the commander! And all
the inquiries made by Alan Garcia from the Socialist International about
the imposing massacre of prisoners in Peru have the same purpose: to yell
over a few "excesses" in order to render daily terror commonplace.
<p>The position of the international proletariat can be none other than
one of international solidarity with the proletarians from Peru because,
through this attack, these are its own interests that are being attacked,
because the women, men, children, old people,... who belong to its own
class and share the same interests are killed and terrorised - and this,
whatever flag they were struggling beneath. Its attitude can be none other
than that of increasing its action against all the fractions of capital
that confront it, whatever they be - imperialist or anti-imperialist, conservative
or progressist, populist or elitist, open accomplices or hiding (that is,
all those who will mourn the dead in the name of the democratic rights
of "man"); against all the bourgeoisie that we have in front of us in every
part of the world. Yet this international solidarity must be organised
and directed: it is the task of revolutionary militants, and it cannot
on any account depend upon agreement with the ideology of a group like
Sendero Luminoso ("Shining Path"). In other words, those who, disagreeing
with, or being opposed to the ideology of this group, remain unconcerned
and do not admit this reality of a brutal attack against the struggle of
the proletariat and act consequently... are neither internationalists nor
revolutionaries. At bottom, they become more and more the accomplices of
what is happening in Peru, of the police vision of history or of the more
common version which likens everything that stands in opposition to the
State in Peru to that group which is internationally renowned as "marxist-leninist-maoist".
Against this position, we affirm that the proletarian resistance (urban
and rural) against extreme poverty is very strong, that for dozens of years
the proletariat of this country has been struggling fiercely against all
the fractions of capital, especially during the Velasco era (who used to
call in Fidel Castro to break the strikes that neither the left not the
right of Peruvian bourgeoisie could break). We also affirm that, like in
other identical situations on the continent, the sanguinary repression
(there are more than 6000 disappeared) is organized accordingly, and accuses
every proletarian of belonging to such or such military group designated
as the Public Enemy No1. In this complex process, thousands of proletarians
do not heed the Sendero Luminoso organisation. And even within this one
political organisation that is a confused mosaic of several tendencies
and positions, expressions of complete rejection of its official ideology
are not lacking!
<p>We make all these assertions without ignoring that the Sendero Luminoso
organisation enjoys a high reputation among the fighting proletarians,
and that all the lies spread around about it (accomplices in the drug traffic,
cutting of the hands of poor peasants,...) are believed in Peru only by
those who are interested in maintaining the status quo. Contrary to other
groups which took up with armed struggle in Peru or in other Latin American
countries, like the Monteneros, the Tupamaros, the Chilian MIR, the Bolivian
ELN, the Sandinists, etc... and which always had an ideology openly nationalist
and, accordingly, a legalist and reformist practice (the Tupamaros uncovered
swindles and brought the evidence to the judges!) of defence of the national
institutions, etc., which have always been the armed wing of the big democratic,
electoral carnivals and, what is more, stuck on all the popular myths like
allendeism, peronism, sandinism, the Torres government in Bolivia, etc.
the Sendero Luminoso has always had an uncompromising position, especially
towards velasquism which was considered as something to support by nearly
all the guerilleros of the continent, whereas the Sendero Luminoso defined
it as the worst enemy, as a grand bourgeois, reactionary, fascist government.
Whereas the other groups were the armed wing of the classical bourgeois
left - which besides they never clashed with but always flattered and flirted
with... so enabling them to become an even more consistent expression of
old national populism - the Sendero Luminoso appeared as something completely
different, confronting both the left and the right. All the populist (and
more generally the left-wing) fractions, once they had taken over the government,
or shared it, they still starved and repressed the proletariat - and the
guerilleros had no alternative whatsoever to propose (though they be so
militarist, their program is the same) and what happened is that the real
proletarian struggles (that have lost their organical, organisational and
theoretical unity with the classist expressions they had during the first
decades of this century) didn't have their own direction, but were canalised
by no matter what bourgeois fraction, even by the right-wing. In Peru,
even when the great nationalist, populist myths prevailed, the Sendero
Luminoso was never the accomplice of the government, even though this is
obviously not a sufficient reason for us to consider this group as a proletarian
vanguard organisation (which is, for us, impossible in the case of a "marxist-leninist-maoist"
organisation), or, more humbly, as a mere proletarian organisation. The
Sendero Luminoso just happened to be in tune with the main proletarian
struggles in uncompromising opposition to the State.
<p>There were two decisive moments in this story. The first under Velasco,
when Sendero Luminoso had just appeared (2). The second after the fall
of Morales Berinudez: that is when the process of democratisation began,
culminating with the return of Belaunde Terry and then of Alan Garcia -
and at that moment, the Sendero Luminoso, its nucleus consolidated, took
to armed struggle.
<p>The Velasco era is decisive because it expresses most strongly the attempt
of the last decades to establish a radical bourgeois reformism (the real
reforms of this progressive military government go much deeper than those
of Allende), an attempt to which, in several ways, Stalinism, social-democracy
and Trotskyism (Hugo Blanco himself) have submitted. Sendero Luminoso is
at that time one of the only groups that denounce and struggle against
the regime. After Velasco's death, the regime "turns to the right"; left-wing
bonapartism turns into right-wing bonapartism, according to the well-known
categorization Trotsky made himself. This is the beginning of an era during
which the whole left passes into the opposition, so that it can regain
a credibility and prepare the conditions required for another era of "democratisation".
This era also marks the beginning of a general process of national unification.
The electoral carnival is prepared and results in the constituent assembly
in 1978 and the presidential elections in 1980. This was another attack,
in a different form, against the proletariat - the same old lies in a different
wrapper: the trotskyist and some other left-wing reformists form a coalition
that wins a majority in the ballot. The orders of the left become a reality,
the Constituent Assembly becomes effective, and the trotskyists present
"red proposals" and other unheard-of clowneries (as if a change in the
relation of forces could be realized through elections!). The electoral
carnival was getting to its apogee while the situation of the proletariat
was still worsening.
<p>We could have thought that the ideology so obviously Stalinist of Sendero
Luminoso would have led them to take part into that carnival. And yet they
did not, for there are other reasons that must be taken into account (the
material interests of the men and women belonging to Sendero Luminoso)
- and neither in this case did Sendero Luuminoso become the accomplice of
the government; on the contrary, it declared war to the elections: on the
17th May, Sendero Luminoso burns down the ballot-boxes in several places
of the district of Avacucho. All these facts led the Sendero Luminoso not
to agree with "the people" that opposes such or such repressive regime,
as it was the case for the other guerrilla-groups, but to side with the
proletariat at the important moments of national unity. That is perhaps
why Reagan considers the guerrilla in Peru as the most threatening of the
world.
<p>In the process which leaves no choice to the proletariat but that of
a still more violent struggle against the bourgeoisie and its State, when
all the other left-wing groups are objectively united against the working-class'
interests under the pretext of condemning terrorism in general and in defence
of democracy, Sendero Luminoso is still in tune with important workers'
struggles, and still incorporates the militants who break up with all the
other organisations. And moreover, Sendero Luminoso appears more and more
as the only structure capable of giving consistence to the ever-growing
number of direct actions of the proletariat in the towns and on the countryside.
<p>What we tell about Sendero Luminoso is not a subjective opinion, we
do not think that we are mistaking objective reality for what we wish reality
should be. We are not making an apology of Sendero Luminoso; on the contrary,
we think that the emergence of a group like that endangers the classist
autonomy, threatens the development of proletarian positions and the organisation
of a true communist vanguard (to be sure, some comrades and groups have
internationalist positions, but their social practice is not very consistent
at the moment) and yet we must admit to it as an objective social reality.
<p>We have no elements to consider Sendero Luminoso (or the CPP, as it
defines itself) as a bourgeois organisation serving counter-revolution.
From what we know of its practice within class struggles (and contrary
to all the marxist-leninist-maoist groups in the whole world) we cannot
tell whether it was ever directly on the other side of the barricades.
<p>We nevertheless maintain that their conceptions are a danger to the
struggle of the proletariat ant that, far from preparing the proletariat
for the insurrection, it carries it away into a blind alley of "prolonged
popular war", with no proletarian, revolutionary perspective. Everything
that Sendero Luminoso has written is based upon the strictest stalino-maoism.
We totally reject its "Mariateguist" ideology, its programmatic non-breaking
with the old Communist Party of Peru, issuing directly from Mariategui
(despite the numerous organisational splits) which speaks for itself, its
description of the Peruvian society as "semi-feudal and semi-colonial",...
We think that its ideology is absurd and only serves counter-revolutionary
confusion. Its conception of social war as being popular and going from
the countryside to the towns contradicts the interests of the proletarian
revolution; its vision of the peasantry as a class distinct from the proletariat
is openly counter-revolutionary and divides the proletariat. We also reject
as counter-revolutionary the position that considers the struggle as a
moment of a revolution which is "at the present stage anti-imperialist
and anti-feudal", as well as its vision considering that the main contradiction
lies within the "people", between "democracy" and "reaction"; also, the
concept of "bureaucracy": all these positions are a falsification, a total
negation of the actual opposition between capital and communism. We also
reject its reformist project of a Republic of New Democracies... and we
will stop this list here.
<p>For those who think that this is not enough: on an international level,
the CPP-Sendero Luminoso is part of the "Internationalist Revolutionary
Movement", a mixture of several Stalinist and Maoist organisations from
all continents, with a document which, from the first line to the last,
is a gross falsification of the international communist movement, of what
is happening and has happened in the whole world. Nonetheless, we must
say that some militants in Peru, linked to the Sendero Luminoso, assert
that this organisation does not acknowledge as militants those who live
abroad, nor those who may have participated in international conferences
with this bunch of counter-revolutionaries from the International Revolutionary
Movement. But even about this, information are contradictory. By the way,
this may be reflecting real differences existing within the Sendero Luminoso
organisation. This seems to us the most plausible hypothesis, given the
information that we have and that come from different sources, not so much
about the internal differences pertaining to this group (3), but, rather,
about the real heterogeneity of a social movement which does at all correspond
neither to what Sendero Luminoso is telling about it, not to the frontiers
that this organisation is trying to impose on it. In fact, we are sure
that there are internationalist comrades who have never been Stalinist,
or have broken away from Trotskyism and all other ideologies of the bourgeois
left, and who continue to reject, like us, the ideology of Sendero Luminoso,
but who find it awfully difficult to appear as a different alternative
within the real social movement of struggle against capital and the State
in Peru. The main reason for this is that the right, the left, the media,
the means of repression, and also many proletarians amalgamate any violent
action against the regime with Sendero Luminoso. In all these cases, and
above all in actions like the struggle in the prisons (where there are
many who do not belong to Sendero Luminoso - even the official press admits
that (4)), there is always a risk that the coincidence between the action
and the repression makes the revolutionary nucleus lose their organisational
and programmatical autonomy. We have not enough information to assert clearly
that in this process, a whole of struggles and actions are (or are not)
directed by the central nucleus of Sendero Luminoso or preserve an organisative
and programmatic autonomy towards this group (or towards others which have
a similar ideology) or again, whether they are indirectly directed by Sendero
Luminoso.
<p>Anyway, we think it means to be accomplice of the State and of the international
press to identify with Sendero Luminoso and its ideology the proletariat
that today is being bloodthirstily repressed in Peru. It means to be accomplice
of the State not to show solidarity with and to dissociate oneself from
the repressed proletarians in Peru under the pretext that they are Stalinists,
Maoists or whatsoever.

<h3>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">Notes</font></u></h3>
(1) The "solidarity" of a group like the ICC becomes clear when they can
only analyse such State repression as "an expression of the decadence of
capitalism", as "part of the barbaric nature of capitalism"... when they
analyse State terrorism against our class, the torturing and disappearing
of our class militants, as "a struggle between the left and right fractions
of the bourgeoisie". Most other groups of the "revolutionary milieu", having
a very similar analysis of class struggle anyway, just stupidly repeated
what the ICC told and wrote everywhere on our account!
<p>(2) This is not a text upon this group, nor a complete description of
its contradictions; this would require a specific, serious study. Yet it
seems important to us to explain in a few words the origins of this group.
The classical Stalinist party of Peru splits in 1964 over the agrarian
question. From then on, the pro-Russian faction will be known through its
review Unidad and they'll be called CPP "Unidad", while the pro-Chinese
faction will be known as the CPP "Bandera Roja". The latter will split
into several currents. In 1965, two groups emerge: the Marxist Leninist
CPP and the FALM. In 1968, there occurs a very important split, which will
give birth to an important reformist mass organisation: the CPP "Red Motherland"
(CPP "Patria Roja"). Meanwhile, the struggle within the CPP "Bandera Roja"
continues, and leads, from the sector of Aji Prop Abimal Guzman (the present
president of Sendero Luminoso, "Gonzalo") to the struggle against the direction
of Paredes up until 1970, when the split formally occurred. The two fractions
still publish a review called "Bandero Roja". If the sector of Guzman has
begun to make itself known as Sendero Luminoso it is due to the fact that
one of its important rank-and-file organisations was called the "Students'
Revolutionary Front for the Shining Path of Mariategui". After nearly one
decade of quasi-uniquely theoretical work - even if there were always references
to a phase of reconstruction of the party" - the pro-"armed struggle" line
was created in 1980. Let's add that this group has been joined by several
groups or individuals that come from "Political-Military Vanguard", from
"Red Motherland" and from the majority group "Communist Proletarian Vanguard".
<p>(3) The non-formally Stalinist Maoism is the most official line, but
there also exist more openly Stalinist positions, like for instance some
pro-Enver Hoxha trends.
<p>(4) For instance, the director of "Equis X" Juleo Cabrera Moreno, an
infamous democratic journalist, states this in his own way: "It has been
proved that, from the beginning, a large number happened to be there though
they had nothing to do with the Communist Party of Peru (Sendero Luminoso).
But in prison, driven by the tortures and the continuous abuses, they started
upholding the dogmas of Sendero Luminoso".

The chemical bombing of Halabja, which resulted in 5000 official deaths,
but in a much more terrifying reality (between 10000 and 15000 deaths in
the medium term) raised a general outcry of indignation from "good citizens".
They all exclaimed in horror at the "excesses of excess" that is war. This,
with its 8 years of uninterrupted massacres and horrors had become banal,
"natural". Its length is the result of capital's need to destroy excess
proletarians (the successive waves of adolescents sent off, guns in their
backs and facing the machine guns and canons prove this clearly enough).
But the war also had the aim of crushing the proletarian struggles, which
were developing in this area. Those that took place in Iran are generally
better known because they led to the fall of the Shah, but Iraq has obviously
not been spared workers' revolts. In Iraq, as in Iran, workers' struggles
have been going on since 1980, in different forms from strikes to riots,
from deserting on a massive scale to localized short-lived attempts at
insurrection. War with its retinues of reinforces national union, its open
repression (mass executions, dispatches to the front-lines,...) has kept
these struggles at "bearable" level for the world bourgeoisie. All the
world bourgeois, from the left as from the right, have always allowed and
encouraged this interminable war in the name of Islam, Socialism, Democracy
(or all of these combined).
<p>The need for the war also means that the bourgeoisie only "reacts" to
"excesses" such as the bombing of "civilian populations" (sic!) and then
only because such bombings show up the goal of all imperialist wars too
clearly: the systematic massacre of all those who have committed the double
crime of being part of a surplus work force and of refusing to accept the
logic of bourgeois society. We spit on those kind gentlemen who demand
a clean war, in which we don't see the terrible spectacle of proletarians,
men, women, children and the confused elderly pinned and mounted in death
for the valorisation of capital.
<p>Evidently, the massacre of Halabja, like the war, is no more an excess
than it is a mistake. It is the cold application of bourgeois needs. They
knew very well that they would carry out such a massacre. And for the Iraqi
bourgeoisie it was not a question of bombing Pasdarans, the shock troops
of the Iranian bourgeoisie, not the Kurdish nationalists, but proletarians!
The target was not chosen by chance, but is a direct product of the failure
of the policy for national unity lead by the different fractions of the
local bourgeoisie, by the Iraqi Ba'athists, by the "revolutionary" Muslims,
or by the "liberators of the Kurdish people". This failure materialised
by the general lack of compliance with such policy and by repeated confrontations
with the police and army.
<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">Struggles in Haljabja</font></u></h2>
(extracts from letters we received from this area)
<p>"(...) Over the whole area riots, demonstrations and other popular activities
against the government and its supporters had been going on for over a
year. Halabja was not like it used to be. It was full of refugees from
the villages that had been wiped out, as well as of people who had left
military service. There was at least one deserter in every house, and sometimes
as many as four or five. People weren't just hiding in their friends' houses,
but were also being taken in by strangers...
<p>Even the curfew at night didn't stop many young people, most of the
deserters and even children from gathering in the streets of some parts
of town.
<p>The government hadn't only destroyed the villages, which had been places
of refuge for deserters and centres of activity for certain groups, Kurds,
the CP,... but also the area of Kani Ashken. Previously, people had organised
attacks against supporters of the State, using this area as a base. Members
of student, youth, union, peasant organisations no longer slept at home,
using police stations or Sarah (the police headquarters) instead.
<p>As for the soldiers, no one was afraid of them anymore. They just politely
requested people to go back home and even had tea at their houses, even
where there were deserters in hiding. They came to our house several times
and just pretended to search the place. They knew full well that we were
hiding people, but they didn't say anything. The Jordanians, the officers
and, of course, the militia, the secret police (Amn) and the Ishkbarats
(Intelligence) were the worst. There were collaborators amongst the townspeople
as well.
<p>Almost every night we heard shooting between the police and the CP and
other organisations. Sometimes there were confrontations between the militia
and armed townspeople, many of the deserters having kept the weapons that
they had got from the army and the various clans. Almost everybody was
armed as anyone could join up with one of the clan armies and be given
a weapon. Joining up with an army enabled them to get legitimate identity
cards.
<p>The place was in total chaos. It was all very difficult to understand
- the government was trying to eliminate  the subversive elements, the "traitors"
and the "troublemakers" who were actually all going around completely legitimately,
within the structure of the pro-governmental organisations. (...)"
<p>The proletariat has fought against all mobilisation and recruitment
campaigns, destined to lengthen the war. The bourgeoisie knew very well
that for this reason in particular, the region was packed with deserters,
mainly in Halabja. Three days before the bombing, Saddam Hussein himself
announced, only a few kilometres from Halabja, that "all those who do not
defend their nation, their land, are considered to be traitors and we will
not hesitate to annihilate them by any means available to us. In this way
we are only acting in our duty to punish all those who betray their nation."
<p>Also, when the Iraqi army began to leave the town, the workers got wind
of the plans for the bombing and began to leave the town to find refuge
in the neighbouring villages and mountains. But the nationalist Kurds of
the Patriotic Union of Kurds (PUK), a large majority of which are members
of the Marxist Leninist Komala (DPIK) prevented them from leaving - with
the help of the Iranian Pasdarans. The pretext given was that Halabja was
a "liberated town" and that this liberty should be celebrated and defended.
Put the Iranian pasdaran were aware enough of the fate awaiting the workers
to have supplied themselves with gas masks and evacuated their partisans.
After the bombing, the survivors of Halabja were packed into camps in the
border region, a tactic that assured their continuing exposure, on the
frontline, to further bombings. They are enduring extremely hard living
conditions, subjected to repression, disease, famine,... So after the Iraqi
State has been forces to bomb "Iraqi populations" (which it had already
been forced to do in bombing some of its own regiments), after the Kurdish
nationalists, helped by Iranian pasdaran, have objectively participated
in this massacre and after they have all pretended mourning the "innocent
victims", they are now torturing and starving the survivors.
<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">Chemical weapons against the proletariat</font></u></h2>
(extracts from letters we received from this area)
<p>"(...) The Iranians began to bomb the town and people ran for shelter
in basements around the area. Some of the basements were packed with 10
to 15 families, that is 300 people per 100m2.
<p>We stayed in G.'s basement for 3 to 4 days. There were 3 rooms in it.
Every now and then we went out in small groups to find something to eat,
so that we wouldn't pass out from hunger. People had to sleep standing
up and the children were terrified, really traumatised... We carried back
the dead from beneath the ruins; missiles and bombs fell on the mosques
nearby and every time we went out we came across other people retrieving
their dead. Once we saw a man who was crying for the dead and we heard
someone tell him to stop crying for them, that he should cry for himself
instead because no one will even know where to put his body by the time
he gets killed! We were in this situation until about noon on Tuesday 15th
March, when the Iranians entered the town. When we came out of the basement
we saw Pasdarans and Peshmergas. It was just like a film. People spent
the rest of the day looking after their dead and wounded. It was a relatively
calm day, an intermission.
<p>At mid-day on the 16th March we were having our lunch and obviously
feeling completely numbed - body and soul - by the whole situation, when
the first missile ripped apart a part of our bathroom. There was loads
of smoke and debris. H. screamed at me that the others had been killed,
but fortunately they had just been knocked out by the blast and only had
a few minor injuries. Thank God the bomb fell on the water tank, otherwise
we would've all been blown to bits. We ran over to the basement on the
opposite side of the street to take cover. Half an hour later the planes
came back from all directions - there must have been at least twenty of
them, believe me - and in a few minutes Halabja was in ruins. Shortly afterwards
we smelled gas. It was just like the smell of garlic. Some of us ran to
get some water and we gave the others wet towels, cloths and clothes to
put over their faces. After having run out a few times I began to cough
and to itch all over. (...) Only a short while after, the gas began to
permeate the rooms - and then the basement. Some people collapsed immediately,
dead. So there was no other choice left to us but to leave Halabja and
walk in the direction of the Goullen Valley. When we got there, there was
a huge crowd of people, thousands of them, all lying on the ground. (...)"
<p>Since the Iraqi forces have devastated all the neighbouring villages
(Said Sadeq, Karadakh and the Shar a Zour region) in pursuit of surviving
deserters and forcing the inhabitants to take arms against the "Iranian
invasion". The refusal to obey these orders has resulted in massive executions.
The Iraqi army shot 400 insubordinates, among them many deserters who had
been granted amnesty during the proletarian struggle, including the 1984
riots in Suleimania that had forced the State to back down. This example
illustrates how the two sides share the job (whilst still in confrontation)
of forcing the proletarians to participate in their imperialist war and
of repressing the recalcitrant by massacres whenever possible.
<p>Facts have shown thousands of times that when workers refuse to sacrifice
themselves for their enemies and when they refuse to defend their interests
by becoming canon fodder, bourgeois terror is only limited by THE FORCE
OF OUR CLASS. This resistance is the reality of our class' betrayal of
the nation and is an essential factor in the defeat of the bourgeoisie.
The practice of systematic massacre is not limited to Halabja and was no
more the first, than it will be the last massacre organised by the bourgeoisie
against our class.
<p>In both camps, the proletariat has violently expressed its refusal of
bourgeois order. And each time that it could, the bourgeoisie responded
to these struggles by naked violence. The rest of the time they put policies
of reform into practice in order to anaesthetize the proletariat while
carrying on with assassinations.
<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">Struggles in Iraq</font></u></h2>
There were at least 3000 executions in Iraq between 1977 and 1979. The
State refused to return the bodies of those shot, fearing the potential
martyrs that they represented and above all riots as a result of these
massacres. A special cemetery was built to bury the thousands of dead.
Some of the bodies could be recovered by their families return for a payment,
and then only months later when the bodies were decomposed and the marks
of torture could no longer be seen.
<p>It is estimated that in 1983 there were 50 000 deserters in the region
of Sulaimania alone, many of them armed. Numerous struggles took place
against mobilisation and the war economy. The State then decreed an amnesty,
on the condition that there would be a return to "normal life" into which
the deserters would be integrated, promising that they would not be sent
back to the front. On the basis of this, some of the deserters came forward
and were promptly arrested by the local authorities and sent back to war
despite the promises. This set off a very radical wave off struggle, which
threatened social peace. Saddam Hussein himself had to intervene and tell
people that the local authorities had misinterpreted the agreement and
that everyone should go home. He went as far as arresting those "responsible"
and even hanged one of his closest colleagues in Sulaimania in order to
calm the workers' discontent. But now that the struggles are less strong
in this area, the deserters who were amnestied are subjected to the implacable
law of the society against which they rebelled: death! When the deserters
met up in massive numbers in the southern marsh region, the Iraqi State
destroyed dozens of villages, bombing and drowning the inhabitants and
the deserters, killing about 2000. The several hundred survivors, a majority
of them armed deserters, were forced to flee towards the central region
of Nassria and Amara near Bagdad, where they continued to carry out acts
of sabotage, attacking convoys of weapons and arms depots. The Iraqi army
could not control them and had to bomb hundreds, thousands of their own
soldiers (at this stage they already carried out chemical bomb attacks,
particularly in the region of Sulaimania and Arbil).
<p>The disobedience has got to such a scale that the Iraqi regime now has
to threaten all officers who fail to bring their troops to the front line
with the death penalty, as traitors, their families are used as hostages
to prevent the officers from deserting, and their own wives are forced
to execute them if they fail in their mission, and this also on pain of
execution as traitors to the homeland.
<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">Struggles in Iraq</font></u></h2>
(extracts from letters we received from this area)
<p>"(...) Things came to a head towards the month of March 1987 and in
May the governmental forces were toppled. The people had taken over and
the police and army had to go into hiding, only being able to move around
in tanks and in armoured divisions. Helicopters circled overhead, calling
for calm and care in the face of the enemies of the nation. Battles were
raging in the areas around the town and the Iranians were getting closer.
The town was bombed by Iranian artillery and there were many casualties.
Everybody was aware of the danger they were faced with, but were in favour
of neither the Iranians nor the Iraqis. They all knew that plans for defence
and counter-attack were being set up all over the place, not in support
of the Iraqis, but autonomously. Preparations were taking place area by
area. For several nights and days everything was overrun and on the 13th
and 14th everyone was in the streets. In the beginning, the soldiers called
for calm but after a while they joined the crowds. We could never have
imagined it, joy and sadness, pleasure and hatred... Even the people that
we had not trusted in the past were with us, side by side, sometimes more
energetic and more violent than we were. Disorder and harmony!
<p>Helicopters bombed the town and everyone panicked, people running to
hide in the nearest houses by the dozens. Everybody was discussing what
should be done.
<p>The State crushed each riot with brutality, executing the leaders and
arresting those who had taken part - in short, everyone who failed to escape
the State's onslaught.
<p>For a few days things were quiet, but on the inside people were steeling
themselves, their hatred growing. Troubles arose during many of the martyrs
funerals, in fact, at any, even the smallest, gatherings. The clans and
other different factions were fighting amongst themselves and the rest
of the population was fighting against them all. The nationalists were
calling for support to free the town, whilst the State called for calm
and watchfulness against the invading Iranian enemy and against traitors...
<p>Several times Saddam sent envoys, army commanders, who promised change
and safety for all, but no one believed them. They made their intentions
very clear by refuting their speeches and actively contradicting their
demands. They killed the governor of Sulaimania who had come to make more
promises and who had refused to answer the people's demands to be told
what had happened to those who had been wounded and taken prisoner during
the last riots.
<p>Sirwan was a town that had been occupied by armed deserters during this
time and the State completely destroyed it, killing everyone. They left
no trace of it - the rubble and the bodies mixed together! Many other similar
attacks on towns and populations convinced people that there was no way
that the State would leave Halabja unpunished. (...)"
<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">Struggles in Iran</font></u></h2>
But the most violent repression is not the exclusive preserve or the Iraqi
State and occurs daily in Iran, in perfect continuity with the practices
of the Shah's government and his sadly famous Savak. Khomeiny, the new
head of State, clearly demanded this continuation and even the development
of policies of terror in saying: "Today it is the duty of every believer
to do the work of the Savak in denouncing opponents and suspects (...).
In this way, we shall have a Savak of 36 million Iranians."
<p>And this policy is not new. Since the fall of the Shah, the different
fractions of the bourgeoisie have shared out the job of crushing the workers'
force, which had been developed in the struggles. The wave of struggles
that had swept Iran, severely disrupted all the State structures, shattering
the army, police and forcing known members into hiding. The State was incapable
of confronting the workers' movement militarily, even with the help of
he few structures still standing principally the Shiite clergy and the
leftists. First, it was necessary to dissolve the armed proletariat into
the "revolutionary people of Iran" and to rebuild solid State structures.
All fractions shared in this job. Initially the "liberal-islamic" governments
of Bazargan and Beni-Sadr were formed and measures aimed at calming the
workers were put into practice, such as increasing wages and benefits,
executing some of the torturers from the old regime, developing Shoras
(councils), etc. The State was supported in this by all fractions, even
the most radical. In this way, the Mujahideen participated in the government
that they strove to give credibility to... in a critical manner. This is
particularly noticeable in the fact that they actually formed Bani-Sadr's
protection service.
<p>Since then they have created their own army (the Iranian National Liberation
Army) in order to be able to participate fully in cornering the proletariat
in the systematic massacring through imperialist war. The Mujahideen organised
in Iraq is made up of between 20000 and 50000 soldiers and carried out
its biggest offensive in April 1988. They are attempting to make the Iranian
proletarians return to war, but this time against Khomeiny, in the name
of the defence of the Iranian homeland.
<p>The Fedayen, more "radical", also accepted the Bazargan regime in order
to "strife at the heart of the system" also... in a "critical manner",
of course. The fact that they were "radical" meant that they were the first
to be repressed, going underground agian in July 1979 in an attempt to
give themselves some credibility. The Fedayen then fought for "liberated
national zones", participating in nationalist struggles in Kurdestan and
for the Turkmenes in the province of Mazardan. In this way they were also
working for the State, by dividing the proletariat into "nationalities"
and, via the support of bourgeois fractions, influencing workers subjected
to the imperialist war in defence of the State, by accepting national liberation
struggles. Once the leftists had performed their function of dividing the
proletarians and the military force had been reconstituted thanks to the
stabilisation of the official army and to the development and militarisation
of the Islamic "revolutionary" committees, repression was set in full swing.
The Shoras were "islamicized" (the ideological name for statifying them,
for making them defend the interests of the bourgeois State) and since
1980, those who resisted this were repressed.
<p>The leaders of the petroleum workers who took an extremely active and
central part in the struggles leading to the fall of the Shah were arrested.
Some of them were executed secretly and the Shoras were destroyed, as were
those of the railways, the centre of independent Shoras and the "revolutionary"
Islamic Shoras alike.
<p>The pasdarans, the shock troops of the bourgeoisie, with a strength
of approximately 25000 men (enjoying all privileges and ready to go to
any lengths against the working class to preserve their privileges), as
well as the Islamic associations, ideological services and mosque committees
undertook all aspects of the running of society themselves. Bani Sadr's
liberal government tottered and made a final attempt to restore credibility
by going underground on the 13.6.81 while calling upon "the people to resist
despotism". On the 2lth June 1981 Bani Sadr is deposed. The policy of taking
over the whole of society began to accelerate from then on. The purges
in education, which had started with books, spread rapidly to teachers,
branded as communists and counterrevolutionaries. Tens of thousands of
them were fired and replaced by Islamic councillors acting as ideological
guides, directors of information and agents of propaganda. They organised
the denunciations, arrests an executions of pupils and students with "negative
opinions". Thus 114 pupils were executed in secret in September or October
1981. This execution lead to armed demonstrations in Tehran, which the
Mujahideen Khalq tried to take over. Those who were supporting the regime
in a critical manner the day before, were calling for struggle against
the same regime a day after. But their basic policy - the defence of order,
work and the State against the working class - has certainly never changed.
<p>Through its unions, its schools and its forces, the "Islamic revolution"
has reconstituted state structures and is developing its armed offensive
against our class.
<p>Since 1980 repression has become massive. Proletarians have been executed
by the dozen for crimes of "war against God and his prophet" and for "insubordination
to governments of the Islamic Republic". After two years of "revolution",
"International Amnesia" talks of 4000 people executed. But the reality
is without doubt 10 times that, because the only executions that the State
in Iran admits to are those which give it a "revolutionary Islamic" image.
The others, like the above-mentioned school kids, are more often kept quiet
because they risk sparking off anger and struggles from our class.
<p>Increasingly, wages are falling very rapidly, redundancies rain down
and bankruptcies are developing apace. The workers, who strike, if they
are not executed, are sent to the front line. When a strike breaks out,
like that of the steel workers in Esphahan on 12th May 1982, the Pasdaran
intervene, attack the pickets, threaten their families, abduct and execute
the strikers if they can. This explains why striking workers arm themselves
so quickly to defend themselves against the State.
<p>Obviously, this situation was made possible by the start of the war
in Sept. 1980. This date appeared extremely favourable for the Iraqi bourgeoisie,
because the State in Iran was so destabilised and in terms of competitive
imperialism, it was "normal" to take advantage of this. But it is this
reasoning and the fact of wanting to profit from the class struggle to
beat an enemy in imperialist war, which allows, whatever the consciousness
of the bourgeois protagonists, the waging of imperialist wars against the
proletariat, against the class struggle.
<p>Imperialist war, determined by the contradictions between classes (as
they are also expressed in the sphere of the economy) attempts to momentarily
resolve these contradictions by crushing the proletariat. They do this
notably by subsuming it under interbourgeois polarisations in order to
cause it to leave its class terrain and participate in social peace - the
peace of the graveyards - in imperialist war. Thus, the Iraqi invasion
has allowed the Iranian State to draw the workers into the nationalist
hysteria.
<p>All the bourgeois organisations, left and right, have closed ranks,
supposedly against the invader, but actually against the class in struggle.
The conditions of life engendered by this war have, little by little, transformed
this weapon against the struggle of our class into a contributing factor
in those struggles. But the sight of daily executions of "devils" and "Kharjit"
(heathens) has shown up the weakness of the national unity, which allowed
so many struggles to be crushed in the past. Many victims of this repression
are members of small groups who have ruptured with leftist organisations
(Fedaye, Mujahideen and Paykar) and are attempting to organise themselves,
especially in towns such as Tabrez, Sanadesh and Tehran.
<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">The peace of the graveyard in Iran and Iraq</font></u></h2>
There is a blockade operated by the world bourgeoisie. It evidently does
not apply to arms sales; both countries continue to receive unbelievable
amounts. It applies more, for example, to information. This is particularly
noticeable because the systematic deformation of events doesn't just take
place in the countries at war but across the whole world. This is normal,
the bourgeoisie lives with class blinkers on all the time, blinkers which
stop them from conceiving of the reality of social confrontation between
two classes, such as can lead to the dictatorship of the proletariat for
the abolition of wage labour.
<p>It is for this reason that Iran is spoken of as a fanatical nation,
where everybody goes to war with a flower on their rifle and the cry of
"Allah Akbar" on their lips. But the reality is completely different and
the bourgeoisie, even the ayatollahs, are compelled to recognise that things
are not so rosy! Despite a greater and greater number of workers being
pushed, with a rifle in the back, to put on uniforms, there are many who
refused to participate in this butchery. There are a greater and greater
number who refused all sacrifices for the war economy.
<p>The regime in Iran has been forced to recognise that some combat zones
have to be depleted of troops so they can be brought back to urban centres
to repress social troubles. In the same way, a high-up dignitary of the
regime has been forced to recognise that, despite the disastrous state,
it seems difficult to impose more austerity measures. These measures would
fall directly on a fringe of the population who are already disadvantaged
and are preparing to dissociate themselves from the "revolution".
<p>Many things suggest that if the Iraqi Army was able to take the Fao
peninsular easily it was thanks in part to the fact that some shock troops
had to be sent back and, more directly, because the remaining troops showed
little enthusiasm for being shot full of holes for the good of the nation.
<p>The social unrest in the towns where the Pasdaran have to be sent is
a direct cause of defeat at the front. Each strike is an act of defeatism.
The breaking of national unity obliges this nation's cops to leave the
front, stopping them from exercising the same repression against the proletarians
in uniform. These strikes show the unity which forms the different moments
of the struggle of the proletariat which is revolutionary defeatism in
practice, which in practice aims for the defeat of the State, "their own"
State, which in practice aims to wreck the State structures of control
and repression. Contrary to what the Iraqi high command would have us believe,
the Iraqi Army has not "taken the Fao peninsula, step by step, after unbelievably
violent combat". The Iranian troops ran away, leaving behind arms, equipment
and shoes. In addition, the Iraqi army also arranged for this flight to
be possible by leaving a bridge intact which connected the peninsula to
Iran. The Iranian soldiers, smaller in number, demoralised and above all,
badly integrated militarily, fled during the bombardments, which preceded
the attack. It is this, which explains all the remarks by foreign observers
that, unusually, corpses were few in number. A more massive presence of
Pasdarans would have allowed them to compel the proles to put up with these
intensive bombardments without budging, and this "in the name of the revolution",
by threatening to shoot anyone who tries to flee. This is anyway the practice
of the entire bourgeoisie in wars: those who refuse to fight are assured
of death by the bullets of the cops who surround the proles in uniform.
Those who come forward and fight against their class brothers have a small
chance of survival, but only as long as there is no collective force confronting
the State!
<p>It is exactly the same in the factories. The proletarians who are fighting
in the factories, as well as struggling directly for better living conditions,
are creating the basis of the unity needed for a definitive proletarian
victory. These proles have directly improved the lot of their brothers
at the front, enabling them to flee; at the same time each struggle by
workers at the front, by immobilising the cops, gives greater possibility
for action to the workers remaining in the enterprises. By their common
actions, proles at the front and in the factories destabilise the State,
showing their unity and giving a basis for organisation. They are working
in this way for the defeat of their own bourgeoisie, a defeat heavy with
consequences: it discredits the State and national unity, it undermines
the morale of the troops (whether they fight on the production front or
on the other front), it directly shows the unity of proletarian interests,
the need to unite against all fractions of the bourgeoisie across all frontiers.
<p>"National" defeats, therefore, directly improve the conditions of struggle
of the proletariat in the defeated country and these, by virtue of this
simple fact, serve as an example, which allows the defeatism in the opposite
camp, not just by its passive example, but by the reality of its propaganda
and its actions. These are not directed against its "foreign" class brothers
but against the world bourgeoisie.
<p>The development of struggles in Iran, the decredibilisation of the State,
the fact that it is always very clear that the bourgeoisie, by means of
its interposed ayatollahs, has taken, since the day after the fall of the
Shah, anti-working class measures demanded by the world crisis... all these
things explain the power struggles within the bourgeoisie. The "hard" faction
lead by Khomenei, think that only the development of the war is going to
allow it to hang on to the degree of control of the proletariat, which
it has now. This faction advocates the return to large-scale human wave
tactics for fighting Iraq. But it seems that this tactic has been abandoned
because it was pushing the workers into revolt too rapidly. The other faction
thinks that the social situation forces the State to look for a credible
alternative to the war. This means without doubt putting forward a bourgeois
fraction which is at the same time credible and able to impose social peace,
imperialist peace, the peace of the graveyard, in return for stopping or
suspending the war.
<p>In Iraq, the situation is relatively different. It is true that the
deterioration of living conditions has brought about very important struggles
in the army and the region of Kurdistan principally, according to the information,
which has filtered out. We can see that the Iraqi State, faced with the
waves of desertions, has been forced to threaten its officers into organising
bombardments of its own army, and to create battles between their own troops.
But the power of the State has managed, more or less, to contain the struggles
within certain regions, which then, shaped practically by this control,
and isolated from the rest of the movement, are crushed section by section.
Deserters are obviously forced to choose for their refuges, regions poorly
controlled by the State. These are zones where it is possible to impose
a balance of forces with the State, like when it was forced to retreat
from Sulaimania. This constraint is already in itself a factor in the unification
of the movement. The chronic difficulty of unifying, in time and space,
the different moments of working class struggle never stops appearing.
It is the chronic difficulty of the movement giving itself a real direction,
not just of leaving bourgeois organisations but more and more of centralising
itself, of organising outside and against them.
<p>More than this, it seems that through the war, the State in Iraq has
succeeded in reorganising its shaky economy. This goes some way to explaining
its advances in the imperialist war. Once again, if the State is succeeding
in this reorganisation, it is directly against the working class and imposes
a powerful development of exploitation. This same development is a double
weakening of the proletariat. On the one hand, it recredibilises and directly
reinforces the State, on the other, it permits victories in the imperialist
war. These victories are further factors in national unity and permit the
isolation of the most determined proles, leading to the defeat of the whole
of our class.
<p>The prolongation of the war is a stabilising element, but equally, it
can push the proletariat into struggle, as it has done already.
<p>That which has been a factor squeezing out social contradictions - the
war - may yet express itself more and more strongly as a factor in the
class struggle. An illustration of this contradiction for the bourgeoisie
is the bombing of towns. This is supposed to lead to the development of
national unity against "the enemy, which massacres innocent populations",
but it became a contributing factor in the class struggle. In Iran, whenever
the Pasdaran arrive in a recently bombed part of a city, they are forced
to cordon it off so as to isolate the victims, since the sight of them
makes proles wild with rage against the State, which pursues and develops
this war. The cordons of "guardians of the revolution" are rapidly insulted,
then attacked, the cries of hate of the workers are expressed less against
Saddam Hussein than against "their" direct oppressor: "Down with Khomeini"
cry the bombed proles of Tehran!
<p>It is this reality, which has caused a slowing down in the bombing of
towns and certainly not the crocodile tears of the bourgeoisie of the whole
world. They receive a first direct dividend from the explosion of each
bomb, a second from each surplus prole killed and a third in the form of
repression of the class struggle. The terrible events of this region remind
us, with the utmost brutality, of the lessons for all time that the proletariat
draws from its struggle.
<p>Nationalism and peace mongering are always against the proletariat.
The proletariat opposes to the first of these its internationalism, to
the second, its revolutionary defeatism, like it is doing in Iran and Iraq,
despite its enormous weaknesses and difficulties, produced notably by its
isolation.
<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">Nation and national interest always mean
the exploitation and massacre of proletarians</font></u></h2>
Proletarians do not have a country. The nation always constitutes the force
of disorganisation of the internationalist unity of the proletarian movement.
The nation is the prison of the proles. The struggle of the proletariat
is always antagonistic to the national interest.
<p>In exactly the same way that inside each country capital wants to tie
the proles to the interest of such and such a factory or such and such
a sector of production, in the same manner, on the world level, the bourgeoisie
try to tie proles to the national interest to, in this way, prevent the
realisation of proletarian internationalist unity.
<p>But when the bourgeoisie in a country sees the need to annihilate the
strength of the proles, it never hesitates to use the forces of another
region for this task. In the same manner, on a world level, when a movement
surges in one country, the bourgeoisie uses the forces of another country
to crush it. For capital, therefore, frontiers do not exist when it is
a question of crushing struggles. All States hold the international passport
of capital when it comes to the repression and crushing of the world proletarian
movement. Nations have no meaning except as a hindrance to the proletarian
movement; they constitute a shock troop for breaking our struggles and
organising capitalist domination. Each time the proles surge in a revolutionary
manner, the nation opposes it as a force of crushing brutality. What kind
of repression, what kind of massacre has not been organised in the name
of wars of national liberation? When and where has the victory of the nation
ever meant victory for the proletariat? In reality, the bourgeois of all
countries love their nation and never hesitate for one second to chop off
the heads of "traitors" who call into question the interest of the nation.
<p>The history of the world proletarian movement suffices to show that
proles have no interest in common with their nation and have nothing to
gain and everything to lose in supporting such and such bourgeois fraction,
or such and such country in a war. The war between bourgeois fractions,
between countries, is the war of profit production, the war of exploitation
and massacre of proles, it is an anti-communist war by its very nature.
<p>Those who struggle under the banner of the defence of the national economy,
those who support such or such "progressive" regime or still such or such
"socialist" country... only affirm themselves as the enemies of the proletariat.
Their only aim is to weaken every attempt by the proletariat to attack
capital.
<p>All nations of the world actively participated in the massacres in Iran
and Iraq, as they always have in all past wars.
<p>The exploitation of the proletariat, the attack against its movement
in England, in France, in Cuba, in Russia, in Nicaragua, in the USA and
in all countries of the world, the massacre in the city of Halabja, the
massacre of proletarians in Tel-el-Zatar (1976), in Sabra and Shatila (1982),
in Sanandadj (in the summer 1979, when the Fedaye, the Komala,... and all
other leftist groups handed over the population, after having disarmed
it, to the attacks by the Iranian Pasdarans)... all these massacres are
part of the same movement of extermination of our class.
<p>The different fractions of the Kurdish, Iranian and Iraqi nationalist
movements, and each one of them according to its own point of view and
its political interests, shed tears for "the martyrs" of Halabja. Each
of these political formations, according to the particular place it is
holding in the capitalist social relationship and in the process of attack
against the proletariat, defends such or such belligerent. Others still,
behind some hypocritical pretext, demand the creation of a progressive
and democratic State in both countries, on each side. The CP of Iraq for
example, that only ten years ago was still very busy reinforcing national
unity, this national unity that proved to be so vital for cracking down
on every revolutionary upsurge! Wasn't it the same CP of Iraq that appealed
upon proletarians to support Saddam and the Iraqi State because "Iraq was
on the road to socialism"? Wasn't it the same CP of Iraq that participated
in the massacre of thousands of proletarians under the pretext of struggle
against American imperialism and against the Shah of Iran.
<p>The bombing by the Iraqi air force of the city of Halabja, already bombed
in April 1974, as well as of the city of Kaladiza, will always remain alive
in the memory of our class. These facts, and too many others as well, are
the indelible mark of blood of the anti-proletarian politics that the different
parties in Iraq are carrying out.
<p>Everywhere in the world, those bastards, who have participated a thousand
times in the massacres of proletarians, have shed their tears about the
Halabja bombings. The Kurdistan Patriotic Union (of Talabani) doesn't hesitate
to denounce this "most atrocious crime" in which it objectively participated!
<p>It's chief Talabani came to Europe to try to frame the proletariat while
using the death of our class' brothers in Iraq as a commodity... turning
the massacres into another useful spectacle for the sake of the bourgeoisie.
He has been trying to take profit from this event in order to develop a
Kurdish nationalist campaign against "Sadam Hussein, the fascist" and making
the workers from Kurdistan participate, alongside the Iranian Army, in
the war against the proletariat.
<p>Those bastards have turned their coat in this imperialist war tens of
times... so as to confront the proletariat in the most efficient manner.
Talabani had been secretly negotiating with Bagdad for a long time already.
The result of these talks was that the members of Talabani's Party could
keep possession of their arms and enter freely into Iraqi cities... to
repress the proletariat. This is how, in 1984 in particular, the Patriotic
Union of Kurdistan participated directly in the repression of insurgents
in Soulemania, firing at the demonstrators from the top of the roofs. The
Patriotic Union of Kurdistan systematically participates in the repression
of all workers struggles, denouncing deserters in exchange for the liberation
of some of their own imprisoned leaders, opposing strikes, shooting at
demos, participating with the army and the police in the hunt for deserters
and for all individuals and groups who were opposing war and hiding in
the mountains.
<p>Now that these organisations, like the Communist Party of Iraq, or the
Patriotic Union of Kurdistan... have spent all their credit and illusions
with the proletarians, certain Marxist-Leninist fractions have started
to present themselves as the real and true nationalists and how they want
to save the movement of national liberation from the hands of these "traitors".
In reality, their programme is nothing else but the historical programme
and policies of the national liberation movements and of anti-imperialism.
The only difference between them and their predecessors is that at the
end of their declarations, they add some words like "proletariat" or "communism".
According to those Marxist Leninist organisations, it is only the proletariat
and the exploited masses who are capable of really solving the problem
of the national minorities through the establishment and the victory of
socialism in Iran and Iraq: this shows the real face of their would-be
internationalism. The upholders of this political line are called Komala
(Communist Party of Iran) in Iran, and the "Road to Revolution" party (a
fraction that split from the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan) as well as other
elements that have recently left the CP, in Iraq.
<p>The aim of these fractions and the reason why they are massacring our
class' brothers are the same as those of the Vietnamese nationalists when
they were fighting against imperialism and for the creation of a Vietnamese
socialist State. The only results for the proletarians in Vietnam, was
to be sent back to the production-process, exactly in the same way as before
independence, or probably even worse, because the new young nation, exhausted
by many years of war, needs even more manufactured products, more labour,
more sacrifices... so as to be competitive regarding other nations in modern
society. Yes, this is how the "free socialist nation" has become another
new prison to make workers sweat blood. And no one doubts that in such
a nation, that has been liberated by the blood of millions of martyrs,
the proletarians wouldn't even dare to go on struggle again, because after
all... these struggles only reinforce the imperialist enemies of the beloved
fatherland, don't they!!!
<p>The socialist government of Vietnam - the supreme reference of all Marxist
Leninists that respect themselves - is keeping thousands and thousands
of proletarians locked up in its gaols so as to "protect the interests
of the revolution". This situation is not particular to Vietnam. Everyday,
our class can witness that in Castro's Cuba, in Mao's China, in Ortega's
Nicaragua, or in any other "socialist" country with some revolutionary
and popular government... workers produce as an exploited class for their
class-enemy, the bourgeoisie, its nation, its national economy.
<p>For those Marxist Leninists, each reference to the internationalist
character of the proletariat and its revolution, can only be an infantile
dream, because, as they express it so clearly "each particular situation
asks for a different and realistic political solution." According to their
views, the proletariat would have to follow, step by step, the programme
they've conceived in their heads, to be able to achieve its aim. We state
very clearly, in front of these people, that the position and the real
politics of the proletariat are always, and always will be, the same, everywhere,
i.e. the intransigent struggle for its class interests, and never for the
sake of its historical enemies: the nation, wage-labour, the democratic
rights and liberties, democracy! The interests of the proletariat are antagonistic
to all the political programmes that give life to this system of exploitation.
The aim of the proletariat is the realization of the worldwide communist
revolution, and such realization does not proceed by stages. The communist
revolution will take place in spite of and against all stages: as a matter
of fact, it will have to destroy these stages if it is not to perish.
<p>Through the different stages, the bourgeoisie is trying to link the
proletariat to the defence of its own bourgeois interests. What those nationalists
call another stage on the road to victory is nothing else but another force
of retardement of the communist revolution, and such a burden weighs very
heavily upon the shoulders of the proletariat. All, those famous "workers'
achievements" are nothing else but additional chains that imprison the
proletariat.
<p>The only achievement that the proletariat recognizes as its own, is
its class' reinforcement, the reinforcement of its internationalist organisation
and of its revolutionary army. Proletarians must know that the "achievements"
that nationalists are preparing them, are nothing else but the different
prison camps for the production of plus-value, it is their massacre on
the altar of value.
<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">Revolutionary defeatism</font></u></h2>
Proletarian internationalism takes upon itself the only possible answer
to the worldwide bourgeoisie, to the capitalist State: this answer expresses
itself, today like yesterday, by the rupture with social peace, by the
reinforcement of all struggles wherever they may rise... this is the only
way to impose the revolutionary and final solution to capitalist crisis
and war. Communist revolution, class war against bourgeois war.
<p>The proletarian answer to imperialist war, is:
<p>* the organisation of sabotage actions against the economy, against
production, against arms convoys... the sabotage of all social peace
<p>* the organisation of all actions that aim at undermining the sending
of troops to the war-front, undermining the morale of the troops
<p>* the organisation of desertions from the front and from the army
<p>* the encouragement to fraternisation, to rebellion and mutiny, to the
pointing of guns at ones' own officers
<p>* the organisation of the most decisive and offensive actions so as
to transform the imperialist war into civil war for communism.
<p>But of course, revolutionary defeatism cannot be conceived of in only
one country. The communist calls for sabotage actions are related to the
international nature of the working class and therefore they're directed
towards the worldwide proletariat. Proletarian defeatism means the uncompromising
struggle against one's "own" bourgeoisie, and so on each side, in all countries.
<p>These activities have been assumed - in different manners and on different
levels... ranging from the mere flight from the battlefields, individual
desertions... to the organisation of sabotage activities, of fraternisation
with those in front... - by proletarians from both sides. But most of the
time, these actions have remained isolated: this is why and how the bourgeoisie
has been able to defeat these revolts!
<p>For those struggles to get out of their local limits and to become more
general, the task of the proletarian vanguard-fractions is to fight for
the organisation of these defeatist movements so as to materialize the
internationalist unity that stands at the basis for the transformation
of this war into an open war between the organised proletariat and the
bourgeoisie.
<p>This once more substantiates our claim that revolutionary defeatism
cannot reinforce itself in a lasting way in only one country or one region,
but must necessarily extend itself - a question of life and death - beyond
all frontiers.
<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">Internationalist solidarity</font></u></h2>
If in Iran and Iraq numerous proletarians have been trying to break with
the whole of the nationalist and bourgeois parties, in Europe also these
breakings have materialised f.i. with the circulation of many leaflets
denouncing these organisations and their nationalist campaigns. In Europe
also, there are militants who are trying to organise these breakings! Undoubtedly
these breakings remain still locked up in daily reality and do not manage,
because of this, to centralise into a unified direction.
<p>The whole of ripostes and breakings that have been taking place spontaneously,
do not yet transform themselves into a more important force and do not
yet materialise in the setting up of an international center for the coordination
and direction of the struggle. These weaknesses are still worsened by the
fact that for years and years many militants from our class have been submitted
to extremely rude forms of repression that have decimated or simply wiped
out the different communist nucleus. This simply corresponds to the situation
of our class that is being decimated in this war in exactly the same way.
The inter-bourgeois polarisations, as well as the terrible conditions of
survival that militants have to endure, make it extremely difficult for
communist militants to assume the continuity of subversive activities as
well as the theoretical reappropriation of the invariant determinations
of the communist movement. Nevertheless, we think it is more than likely,
although we do not have enough information about this, that these kind
of activities are being assumed, on different levels, in different areas.
<p>In Europe, this has expressed itself (once more, with many weaknesses,
because of the balance of forces on the world-level that is very un-favourable
to our class) through the circulation of leaflets against the war, and
sometimes through the beginning of clashes between nationalist militants
and internationalists.
<p>In Vienna, a leaflet was distributed, on March 27th 1988, that said:
<p>"All the nationalist organisations support the Islamic State and against
all those who really participate in the Iran-Iraq war, who are killing
proletarians, we call for internationalist solidarity. Down with both sides!
The proletariat has no interests in this war! We must fight the sending
of arms!" - A group of Kurds from Vienna -
<p>Here is the content of another leaflet that was distributed:
<p>"The war of destruction between Iran and Iraq only serves the interests
of the worldwide capitalist system; it has been lasting for over 8 years
with the aim of reinforcing the capitalist State on each side so as to
perpetuate and develop the repression against the workers' movement of
that region, while using workers as cannon-fodder. Down with both capitalist
States in Iran and Iraq. Let's unmask those organisations that support
this war. Long live the internationalist solidarity of the proletariat!"
<p>Still another leaflet states:
<p>"Workers and exploited! The only way to get rid of this bloody war is
to reinforce the unity of our struggles, against both sides, while transforming
this war in a civil war for bringing down both States. Down with Iran.
Down with Iraq. Down with all organisations in this region! Long live the
unity of proletarian struggles on both sides!" - Some revolutionaries in
exile -
<p>Of course, these are only quotes. In spite of the fact that some "revolutionaries",
with their ideological vision on how the revolution "should-be", will only
see the weaknesses of those leaflets (and we do not deny that such weaknesses
exist) we want to stress the importance of such actions, and we want to
encourage those militants who manage - in spite of many difficulties (repression,
isolation,...) to affirm the internationalist interests of our class beyond
all national boundaries!
<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">Today's situation</font></u></h2>
From the very outset of the war, the situations in Iran and Iraq showed
quite some important dissimilarities. In Iran, the war started at a moment
when the Islamic State was still trying to defeat and liquidate the important
struggles that had been going on for several years already. At that stage,
the Islamic regime had not yet discredited itself too openly: the very
radical speeches against "capitalist decadence" and for "international
revolution" still prevailed. On top of that, Iran could easily present
itself as a "victim", as an "aggressed" country, "aggressed" by Iraq, as
well as by the whole international community of Nations. All this favoured
the initial campaigns for national union and mobilisation in Iran. This
explains the first "victories" gained by Iran over Iraq. In Iraq, the situation
was quite different: fierce repression had been keeping the workers' struggles
at an all-low level for years, but at the same time, the regime of Saddam
Hussein had lost all of its credit. This explains why it will be more difficult
for Saddam Hussein to create a real national consensus around his war and
why there has been no mass mobilisation in Iraq in favour of the war. Quite
to the contrary, from the very outset of the war, the Iraqi army command
had to face sabotage-activities, desertions and all other kind of proletarian
resistance against the war. This is also why an important part of the battle-troops
is composed of professional army personnel. It will only be the important
support that Iraq is getting from most other nations (USA, France, UK,
URSS,...) and the fact that after years and years of massacres, struggles
in Iran also will start to redevelop themselves... that will allow for
Saddam Hussein not to be submerged by Iranian attacks on several occasions.
<p>So throughout these long years of unslaughter, important struggles have
been developing on both sides, making up for a certain homogenisation of
the situation of proletarians on both sides.
<p>So the possible development of defeatist struggles across the borders
and spreading to the whole region had become a real and potential danger
for the bourgeoisie of the whole world. It is mainly this situation that
has determined the worldwide bourgeoisie to impose a cease-fire and to
prepare the peace-negotiations between Iran and Iraq.
<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">The process of peace</font></u></h2>
Peace must serve the purpose of pacifying once more the explosive social
situation that 8 years of uninterrupted massacres have created. This pacification
must be obtained through the celebration of "victory" (in Iraq mainly),
through the need for the reconstruction of the national economy,... and
this will unavoidably mean the repression of all proletarians who refuse
the dissolution of their class' interests into the interests of the "people".
With the end of the war against the external enemy, both countries can
once again assign all their energy and all their forces of repression directly
against the subversive elements of society who do not recognise the benefits
of such a costly peace!
<p>The bourgeoisie is using this peace to crush the workers' struggles.
The bombings of several cities and of whole areas in Iraqi Kurdistan have
shown this in a most atrocious way. Of course, while the bourgeoisie is
bombing our class brothers in one area, at the same time it is talking
about amnesty in some other area... all this poison just to defeat our
class!
<p>In both countries, the cease-fire has allowed the bourgeoisie to go
ahead with mass executions. If more especially we can hear talking so much
about the Kurdistan area, this is mainly due to the fact that this is one
of the regions where all throughout the war, in spite of the bombings,
in spite of repression from all governmental and nationalist forces (Komala,
Pasdaran, PDKI,...) proletarians have continued to refuse to sacrifice
themselves for the sake of the nation, be it Iranian, Iraqi... or Kurdish!
<p>Peace and war are seen to be two distinct instants of the same human
submission to capital's dictatorship. The proletarians - rebellious victims
and revolutionary subjects of social reality - are the organised men and
women who attack the bourgeois peace to as great an extend as war because
it sees only a false alternative in the different instants... "work and
die" or "march and die"! Through this understanding of the reality of what
they are submitted to by capital, proletarians can fight against war, against
work or, better still, in their fight against work they also fight dialectically
against war and peace.
