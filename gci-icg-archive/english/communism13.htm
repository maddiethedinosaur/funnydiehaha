<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">The tyranny of value in process - the affirmation
of the revolutionary programme</font></u></h2>
Over a century has passed since the critique of the economy (1) put forward
that <i>the dictatorship of value valorising itself</i> is the essence
of capitalist society and that the usefulness of the objects produced is
merely a means serving this omnipresent dictatorship. Use value merely
supports exchange value, value in process.
<p>All misery, all dictatorships, all wars, all human exploitation and
oppression are the expression of this <i>infernal tyranny of value</i>
that has become the true subject, the God of the whole society.
<p>The world is not ruled by ideas, politics or laws but by the economy,
thirst for profit and money; ideas, politics, rights and state terrorism
only serve to maintain and consolidate the expanded reproduction of this
tyranny.
<p>In other words, the state, democracy,... ie. the structuring of Capital
as a force of domination (in whatever form it organises itself), only prolong
of the profound dictatorship of value over human life. Terrorism, be it
overt or covert, parliamentarist or bonapartist, fascist or antifascist,
is no more than the expression of the merciless reality of a world submitted
to the law of value.
<p>The fact of showing that exploitation, dictatorship, oppression, misery,...
are not caused by any particular person, "exploiting boss" or government
with a crazy or racist leadership (2), but are the inevitable expression
of the development of value in process, was a theoretical point of decisive
importance for the revolutionary movement. Demonstrating that all contradictions
and torments of bourgeois society are already contained in <i>the basic
cells of this society</i>, in <i>the commodity</i>, in the contradiction
between use and exchange value, was not only an added stimulus for the
process of the development of international revolutionary associationism
over the years, but also brought clear elements of <i>revolutionary direction
and programmatical content</i>.
<p>Of course, all these programmatical affirmations, this theory which
strips capitalism bare, were the product of international worker associationism
at a moment of affirmation, and, as Marx and Engels frequently stated,
were <i>the work of the Party</i>... This organisational and programmatical
strengthening of the revolutionary movement concretised itself later in
the Communist Party Manifesto, in the development of the revolutionary
press, in the proletariat’s direct action, its efforts of centralisation,...
as well as later in the First International, the revolutionary movement
of the proletariat in Mexico (1868-1870), in France (1870-1871), etc.
<p>Communism thus armed itself with decisive weapons to understand and
denounce any kind of reformism and made a fundamental step towards the
affirmation of its own programme. Indeed, at the same time, a huge number
of theories and bourgeois parties (both formal and informal social-democratic)
aimed at the workers were expressing themselves for the first time as a
reaction to the development of the proletarian movement. These forces and
ideologies denounced some of the evils of bourgeois society and proposed
"solutions" and reforms that left the essence of mercantile society intact,
for example Proudhon’s theory and plans. Some called themselves socialist,
progressive, anarchist, social-democratic, communist, anti-authoritarian,...
but it was clear (3) that they were just the miserable expression of the
left of bourgeois society itself and their programme only proposed to eliminate
one or other "unfortunate" consequence of mercantile society, leaving the
basic cell (the commodity), its reproduction, value producing society and
thus exchange and wage labour intact.
<p>Thus the practical antagonism of revolutionary movement versus reformism
and the affirmation of the programme of the revolution itself developed
and asserted themselves simultaneously. A change of government, the "democratisation"
of a state, state control of the means of production, agrarian reform,
banks for the poor or remuneration based on labour vouchers... can never
truly oppose the general dictatorship of value valorising itself and it
is ridiculous to think that they could. The only solution, for the whole
of humanity, is the abolition of the law of value, <i>the total and despotic
destruction of the tyranny of the econom<b>y</b>. </i>This is the centre,
the heart of the communist programme, the key to the invariance of the
revolutionary programme for the destruction of capitalism as much for today’s
militants as for the militants of yesterday.
<p>The need for the violent destruction of all bourgeois social structures,
for the proletariat to organise into class and party, for the dictatorship
of the poor and later, more clearly, for the dictatorship of the proletariat
had already been expressed long before Marx and Engels systematised the
essence of the revolutionary programme around the destruction of the economy.
With Marx and Engels, the need for and the possibility of dictatorship
of the proletariat found its practical basis, thus relegating to utopia
any pretentions to radical change without the destruction of the commodity.
<i>The
revolutionary dictatorship for the abolition of the mercantile society</i>
was then practically (although not always formally) written on the flag
of every real proletarian struggle against capitalism and the state.
<p>Up until then revolutionaries had been seen as utopians (4), but were
now able to show that it is actually reforms or partial "revolutions" that
constitute utopias.
<p><i>"It is not radical revolution or universal human emancipation which
is a utopian dream...; it is the partial, merely political revolution,
the revolution which leaves the pillars of the building standing"</i> (K.Marx,
<i>"Critique
of Hegel’s Philosophy of Right"</i>, 1844.)
<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">The ABC of the revolutionary programme: the
dictatorship of the proletariat</font></u></h2>
Considering the extent of the distortion and ideological falsification
characterising the present time, it is not superfluous to clarify an ABC
of the revolutionary programme. The essence of capitalism today is (and
it could not be any other way) exactly the same as yesterday. As we have
said many times before, the revolutionary programme is <i>invariant</i>;
only the dictatorship of the proletariat and the resulting abolition of
the commodity and wage-labour can bring a real solution for humanity.
<p>We would very much like to reopen the discussion on the content and
extent of what we, the communists, call <i>the revolutionary dictatorship
of the proletariat</i>; we would like to concentrate on certain aspects
of our programme that have been distorted and corrupted by the counterrevolution
and that will be essential at the time of the next worldwide revolutionary
wave of struggle.
<p>Starting from the historical necessity for the destruction of the dictatorship
of value, it will be of prime importance to fight against all ideologies
(like that of one-nation socialism) that see the dictatorship of the proletariat
as a political dictatorship, as a formal dictatorship of one or other sector
or party of the "proletariat" or "socialist party". We must oppose them
with our own conception that the <i>social</i> character (the <i>total</i>
character) of the dictatorship of the proletariat is the historical revenge
of use value against value, <i>the affirmation of human necessities against
value in process</i>. This clarifies why the proletariat has never been
able to impose its dictatorship and that, as the antagonism which will
triumph against commodity and all its laws, can only impose itself on a
<i>worldwide
scale</i>. It then becomes clear that, apart from certain struggles of
class against class, as in Mexico at the beginning of this century, in
Russia from ’17 to ’19, in Germany a little later or in Spain in the 30’s,
when we fought against the thousand and one expressions of the law of value,
it is a nonsense to talk about "dictatorship of the proletariat" in any
country. Even in exemplary cases of organisation of revolutionary action
by our class we have just mentionned, we can only talk about <i>prefiguration</i>
and <i>attempts</i> to impose class dictatorship - not about the dictatorship
of the proletariat itself, which can only be worldwide.
<p>In the same way that revisionism and reformism invented the absurd theory
of one-nation socialism and the dominant class of the world took pleasure
in talking about "socialist countries" or "communist countries", certain
more radical sectors of the marxist bourgeois Left invented the theory
of the dictatorship of the proletariat in one country or, worse still,
the theory of the workers’ state, first in Russia and later in other countries.
<p>We also want to stress how the need to abolish autonomous decisions
by productive units, to abolish the autonomy of sellers and buyers, of
supply and demand and to abolish the equality of the individual and his
freedom to decide (the very basis of mercantile society) is an essential
aspect of the dictatorship of the proletariat and will be decisive in coming
battles of the proletariat. We want to emphasise that the dictatorship
of the proletariat will not only have to abolish firms in their present
condition, but also units which are autonomous in their decision-making,
whether as groups of factories or as economic sectors, as both of these
imply the existence of exchange between them. We want to show the vital
need to abolish democracy in all its expressions, not only parliamentary
but also "councilist", workerist, etc. Last, but not least, we would like
to develop the key elements in the fight against the ensemble of ideologies
(such as federalism, workerism, "anarchism",...) which will be an obstacle
to the development of revolutionary and organic centralisation against
the law of value.
<p>The <i>programmatical determinations of revolution develop in antagonism
to the programmatical determinations of capitalism</i> and to its attempts
at reform, which is precisely whywe feel it is indispensable to draw these
general lines concerning the dictatorship of the proletariat in this text
on the dictatorship of value, the dictatorship of the economy. However,
further development of topics linked to the destruction of the dictatorship
of value will take us too far away from the aims of this text and will
soon be the focus of another text (5).
<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">Open discourse on the dictatorship of the
economy</font></u></h2>
Here we want to underline some aspects of the dictatorship of the economy
today, the modern development of the dictatorship imposed by value in process
on all spheres of human life, the current forms of dominant discourse which
aim to increasingly subject human beings to the faceless monster which
is the economy.
<p>Even though the dictatorship of the economy has always been a constant
feature of capital, it nevertheless required a long process before the
duty to serve the economy, the need to sacrifice oneself for competitiveness,
the obligation to make an effort for the national economy or any demand
to tighten belts to "boost" the economy could be declared openly. Much
water has gone under the bridge and much blood been shed throughout the
world until it has finally become accepted as the natural order of things
that man is worthless and the only thing that matters is the national economy,
competitiveness...
<p>Although bourgeois society, and particularly the national economy, has
always considered human beings as a mere means of enrichment, capitalism
in previous centuries concealed its aims (at least ideologically and partially)
and no government would have been able to say, as openly as they do today,
that people must sacrifice their life in the interests of the economy.
Dominant factions of the bourgeoisie looked for (and, for the most part,
found) ways of presenting the interests and needs of their class and faction
as beneficial to their own class in the first instance and, second, to
the whole society (an essential condition to enable class domination to
impose itself without any major explosions). They never tired of repeating
that the problems of the disinherited masses would be solved in the medium
or long term and that the world would become a better place. Governments
promised a brilliant future in the same way that priests promised the kingdom
of heaven.
<p>Today, there is no such talk, no further promises of a better future
on earth, no mention of a solution to hunger and misery - they state openly
and defiantly that we must continue to sweat our guts out and that the
future will be even worse. In the past, although few believed it, it was
said that misery would decline, that the starving and miserable would be
saved by economic growth and that, in the future, there would be less and
less of them. Today, they do not even attempt to hide the fact that in
the world they promise, there will always be people in rags, ever more
and more on the scrap heap.
<p>Politicians and governments no longer make speeches demanding sacrifices
in the name of a better world for all. They openly state the need to condemn
more people to unemployment, starvation, misery,... the need to make cut-backs
in social expenditure, etc, because the economy requires it in order to
make businesses competitive. Given that the development of capital imposes
one sole programme on all bourgeois factions, the more uniform their speeches
become, the more apparent it is that there are no differences between politicians
and governments. Their electoral campaigns, their parliamentary struggles
and their coups are not setting different programmes or factions against
each other, but are only quarrelling over their share of the spoils, bribes
and other tricks, which is doled out according to the fierceness/eagerness
of their struggle to increase exploitation and the appropriation of surplus-value:
the greater their capacity to give a framework and to adhere to austerity
measures, the greater their share.
<p>The economy itself has become the dominant issue for all politicians
and all governments. In the past, the decisive place of the economy was
hidden behind religion, politics or various other ideologies and there
was no way in which it could be used as an argument of force against human
beings; moreover, a politician or a government would fall into disgrace
if he dared to reveal the secret of domination and openly declare that
all should be sacrificed on the altar of the economy, of the national economy’s
competitiveness.
<p>The original guilt complex of the bourgeoisie (that imposed its social
system in the name of the people and social equality -"Liberty, Equality,
Fraternity") lead it to hide the fact that this system sacrifices human
beings on the altar of money. Politicians hid what cynical and lucid bourgeois
economists (such as David Ricardo) had discovered and written down in their
scientific works. Politicians, ideologists, and governors assumed the task
of keeping the "secret" in the circle of the "initiated". Today, on the
contrary, they proclaim it far and wide: the only thing that matters is
the drive for profit, the competitiveness of the national economy and if
people must starve for it, then this is just a necessary evil. Every politician
tries to show off his entrepreneurial skills, calling on the population
to work harder and earn less.
<p>The destruction of man and of solidarity between men has reached paranoid
levels: It has become normal, logical and natural that people should starve
to allow businesses to be profitable. In the same way that we are advised
to take our umbrella with us when it is raining, we are told that hundreds
of thousands of people, millions of human beings will have to suffer for
the sake of the national economy, and that the only way to escape this
disaster is to work harder. As a way of trying to deprive us of our last
remaining grains of class solidarity, it is suggested that we give a donation
to an NGO or buy non-perishable goods at our local corner shop for them
to send to the poor in another part of the world. Sacrifice and individual
welfare are the order of the day.
<p>Further explanation or justification is not really necessary - it is
obvious that the degree of separation, of alienation from human need and
human community is so enormous that is seems perfectly normal to everybody
for a politician to drone on for hours about economic statistics, the need
for people to make sacrifices and the benefits for businesses. The concrete,
the reality of man, is turned into a complete abstraction, so that what
appears to be concrete and real for the amorphous mass of citizen-spectators
is infact a total abstraction: the well-being of the country, the future
of the national economy. The famous revolution in communication, that has
infact resulted in human separation at levels never previously experienced,
is a decisive factor in this generalised abstraction of the human race.
It would have been totally impossible to convince a proletarian in past
centuries or at the beginning of this century that it was not him, his
comrades, his children, his parents,... that is to say his class, humanity...
that mattered, but rather the "Maastricht criteria", the Mercosur (6),
"Plan A or Plan B", the "benefits to our economy offered by the latest
tax",... and this abstraction has a greater right to exist than man made
of flesh and blood. This is why any proletarian acting according to his
needs and the needs of his class is conspiring against established democratic
order.
<p>It is beyond the framework of this text to discuss up to what point
this situation marks the objective and historical limits of the whole of
the bourgeois social system, given that the ruling class is no longer able
to offer any viable plan for the human race or, on the contrary, whether
the present situation reveals that this system can carry on imposing any
kind of sacrifice, given that the proletariat is not capable of reconstituting
itself as class, as an historical force at this time in our history. In
any case, we think that both these realities characterise the present international
situation, in so far as the ruling class always acts as if it has no limits
and the proletariat only occasionally and regionally responds, without
managing to constitute itself into a worldwide force. This situation continues
to determine an ensemble of contradictory characteristics in present-day
struggles (7).
<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">"Crisis" or "recovery", it’s always the same
old song</font></u></h2>
"The crisis has arrived, we have to tighten our belts", "the recovery is
fragile, just a little bit more effort",... "we can see the light at the
end of the tunnel, now is not the time to be making demands", "We are doing
better, but growth is still weak"... is what we hear from the left and
from the right of this spectacle aimed at submitting us to the dictatorship
of the economy. If this damned economy goes wrong we have to make sacrifices
to put it back on track, if it’s going okay, we have to continue to make
an effort so as not to thwart it and so as to improve it even more, if
it is struggling, we have to <i>make further sacrifices</i> to enable it
to recover. This is the <i>ever clearer order of the system that we are
subjected to</i>. What they are telling us is "keep on rowing, it’s impossible
to leave this galley."
<p>It is like believing in Father Christmas to live in hope that a government,
a political party, a union or a TV channel,... will ever announce the good
news that we can now make the most of life with no more sacrifices, that
we will live a better life and even the poorest will be privileged, with
increases in wages and social assistance, all of us working less and eating
more.
<h3>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">Notes</font></u></h3>
1. To be more accurate, we should say "the criticism of economy in its
<i>theoretical</i>
expression" because we are referring to the first theoretical formulations
and explanations of this process. In reality, the dictatorship of value
has developed since the origin of exchange, the autonomisation of exchange
value and the development of the general equivalent, up until the institution
of the community of money
<i>as the sole and unique</i> community of yielded
men: the whole of the human species is submitted to this dictatorship (practice
will show, against all kinds of ideologies, including "marxist" ones, that
since that historical moment, regardless of immediate forms of production,
human beings have become nothing more than a labour force for the reproduction
of world capital). As the proletariat is the very object of this dictatorship
and opposes it in a total, existential and vital way, its criticism of
the economy begins with its own existence.
<p>2. Of course, capitalism still teaches that some bosses are exploiters
(as if they were not all) or that dictatorship, war and barbarism can be
blamed on some crazy men such as Pinochet, Hitler or Saddam Hussein.
<p>3. The term "clear" is not to be taken in the democratic sense of the
word, meaning that the majority of proletarians would clearly spot their
enemy within these movements, but in the sense that the social practice
of all reformism objectively opposes itself to the historical and social
interests of the whole of the proletariat, in the sense that any reformism
reproduces and maintains mercantile society, the root of all evil. Only
a more or less organised minority, more or less centralised into an autonomous
force depending on the epoch, can openly and explicitly denounce it. It
is obvious that the affirmation of the revolutionary programme, the result
of the general antagonism of the whole of the proletariat against capitalist
society, can only be consciously crystallised by a minority of proletarians;
to pretend the opposite would be equivalent to working towards the dissolution
of the class, sabotaging the historical action of the constitution of the
proletariat into the party.
<p>4. We do not mean that up until that moment total revolution has been
a utopia, but that until then the programmes, social projects had stemmed
from the ideas and desires of revolutionaries and were still mixed up with
the purification of the world of that time. Therefore, although the revolutionaries’
acts totally opposed those of the reformists, their projects did not express
the same level of rupture and antagonism. For example, we are referring
to everything that has been called "utopian socialism and communism" in
which revolutionary affirmations coexisted with minor reforms of the bourgeois
world.
<p>5. The best way to develop these points lies in the analysis of the
experience of the proletariat in its revolutionary attempts, more specifically
in the analysis of the causes of its defeats. In this sense, we are continuing
our fundamental programmatical work on the revolutionary period 1917-1923
worldwide, as well as the revolutionary attempts in Mexico at the beginning
of the century and in Spain in the 30’s.
<p>6. Commercial agreements uniting Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay, and Paraguay.
<p>7. On this subject, also read "General Characteristics of the struggles
of the present time", in Communism n&deg;9.
<p>8. This does not mean that this article is any more or less important
than other more abstract or global texts such as the introduction to the
dictatorship of the economy. Both texts express different levels of the
same content that are both necessary and essential for our struggle.

<blockquote><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=-1>Below we have published
a translation of two texts, examples of the forms taken today by the dictatorship

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=-1>The first one <b>"The Economy
is in crisis... May it die!"</b> was translated and published in French
in 1998. Written by Akefalos in Spain, it talks about the dictatorship

imposition of dominant ideology, of citizenship, of generalised imbecilisation.</font></font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=-1>The second text <b>"Death to

The bluff of the year ’92 has passed (2). After having hypnotised people
with a "prosperous" period featuring the consumption of rubbish, debt,
and the growth of speculative benefits, now the crisis is being pushed
on us. Ah yes, the national selection won the medal and the untouchable
Bar&ccedil;a won the soccer championship. Some time before the PSOE, with
its reconversion, as a loyal servant of Capital carried out the <i>transici&oacute;n
</i>(3)
and began the modernisation of Oppression in an accelerated way. In doing
so it erased from the map the assembly movements, which characterised the
end of Franquism and the <i>transici&oacute;n</i>. Civilised trade-unionism
was implanted and ill-being was framed in the language of state-capital:
economy, politics. When trade-unions (and other forms of civic opposition)
say No we can be sure that it’s a Yes in disguise, in that the State needs
an opposition to carry out sham strikes so as to demobilise and discourage
people. In government/trade-union negotiations the function of the latter
appears clearly in the spectacular game of politics: control the poor and
inject the "raison d’&eacute;tat" into our heads.
<p>We live in a society in which politics have displaced the very language
of the oppressed (4). This lie is decided, managed, and disguised into
a single reality. Our misery and our monotony are managed. Wealth, which
is already abstract and non-existent is managed like God in the middle
ages. No one can be outside of today’s christianism: the cult of monetary
abstraction, Economy, and Politics. Projects are managed and developed
to manage the deficits, benefits, and repression.
<p>The social priests with their social services domesticate, recompose,
re-use marginality for the humanitarian commerce of the concept of Solidarity,
reappropriated by the State. The spectacle of social costs, and their decrease,
and of the fictitious struggle that’s created once more, are developed.
<p>The useless, the fired, and the specialists of social emptiness investigate,
calculate, redefine the problems so as to solve them through their own
self-perpetuation. In reality, they are our problems.
<p>Marginalisation takes place by putting people on the dole for life.
Marginalisation takes place through the fruitful business of drug repression,
of "delinquency", thanks to the great commerce of total control of society.
They manage, manage, manage,... They manage as they infest our lives with
"security" and with mortal social boredom.
<p>The means of communication diffuse their lies, the hypocritical gesticulations
of superfluous commercials of information. Our neurones are paralysed...
Beware! They speak, inform, broadcast, sell, form. They destroy, immobilise
what exists, the desire of life which is revolt, and which only takes on
an existence when it dies and becomes sellable by all mediums (of diffusion).
Only their vision of the world exists, a world in their image and which
resembles them.
<p>They frighten us. They incite fear in us. They integrate us into their
paranoid game of apparent realities. Computer control, control through
information, political circus, invention of races, reality show, recyclable
ecological-and-selling-so-very-well survival, they close us into this routine.
<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">How to define this "modern" permanent counterrevolution
in this piece of the pie?</font></u></h2>
At the end of the 1960s there developed a process of modernisation of oppression
throughout Europe (5) (in part so as to end the wild and non-mediated struggles
such as the French May ’68 or the Italian autumn), which made the world
even more unbearable for us. The real communication, without any intermediary,
which had risen up from experience and struggle was cut. The gap which
separated the ruling class, the State, and the oppressed, and which could
be perilous for domination, is overcome by politics, trade-unionism, consumerism,
and the need of money. Money brings about distance and isolation among
the poor. The need of money determines a qualitative loss in relations
(6). The anguish of money as a distorting element comes into our behaviour:
appearance, facade. We show it all, we have to show it all even though
we know very well that we can never own more than a tiny part, generally
the most kitsch, the ersatz...
<p>The caricature of "wealth" is shown, and it is precisely a caricature
because it is exhibited in the world of the poor.
<p>All we know about the world of the rich is what we are shown on television
series. And we know that there is nothing more fake, but it’s also what
we most desire and what we imitate the most.
<p>Society shows itself capable, time and again, to digest and sometimes
to create revolts, be it through repression, recuperation, or both at the
same time. The dynamism of society manages to integrate, be it willingly,
or by force.
<p>During the <i>transici&oacute;n</i> and under the government of the
PSOE the domesticating role of the trade-unions, as apparatuses in the
service of State-Capital was quite clear. Faced with these trade-unions
there were, at times, assembly movements (7) which in outflanking them
confronted capital. The State recreated the trade-unions so as to control
struggles through bureaucracy, representation, and the act of negotiating
by delegation. Today the trade-unions have very few adherents.
<p>They reach less than 15% of wage workers (8) and are greatly subsidised
by the State. Thus they form an integrated part of the State and are, in
themselves, an institution of the latter at the same time as its best servant.
<p>The "Raison d’&eacute;tat" ended up imposing itself by liquidating the
assembly movement through trade-union recuperation, repression (many times
very bloody as in the case of Vitoria, Reinosa, Euskalduna, against the
dockers,... going so far as to murder proletarians), and division. It managed
in this way to impose its dynamic, its discourse, its way of living.
<p>Democratic spectacle tries to channel social insubordination. The very
holy trinity State-Capital-Economy is above all criticism and so is unattackable.
Everything is submitted to the logic of money, that is, to the logic of
mere subsistence, all the way to its maximal expression of economic abstraction.
Abstraction of a lie, which is universal and in which we believe.
<p>The impossible ideal of modern capitalism is to transform metropolitan
workers into middle-managers. Faced with this collective failure, an important
part of workers and a great deal of developing countries (9) are forced
into misery and marginality. The lie of belonging to a pacifist middle
class, serves as to muffle the blow of potential social deflagration. Absurd
notions such as users and civic spirit appear here. They flow out of, and
also provoke, the submission of daily behaviour. Citizens? A grateful term
used by the masters for the good slaves, poor but honest.
<p>And in the idea of a middle class appears a new contradiction: decrease
in budgets, increasingly costly standard of living, and new commercial
expansion for the big ones. The multinationals dominate the market, absorb
and annihilate the little ones and, at the same time, decentralise production
in small groups which, in most cases are only companies which hide the
reality of autonomous workers, dependent on the multinational itself, or
else they create centres where new urban workers are hired by the day.
<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">Of course with this crisis yuppies aren’t
jumping out of windows</font></u></h2>
Immersed in the shit of survival loaded with alluring advertisements and
shop windows ready to rob us of our miserable wages. The ground is strewn
with coins or alms for those on the dole. Knives pulled out so as to get
a dose even if it means ending up in the nick. Workers in self-employment,
or what comes out to the same thing, in self-exploitation (10). Workers
submitted to the account of others, the exploiter is the client, the user
and the tax department. Self-management of exploitation, emptiness of social
struggle. Too much work, it’s time to take a shower and shout out an arrogant
"I’m my own master". Never has a worker so clearly proclaimed his eternal
self-prostitution, his will to integrate himself in the innocuous middle
class. And let’s hope that all of this will not be assumed as it’s done
by the small businessman.
<p>Urban day labourers. People looking for odd jobs so as to subsist. Swamped
jobs. The dole for life. Precarious jobs. Workers domesticated by costs,
threats, contracts, credentials. Trade-unions which decide for you, enterprises
for the reproduction of labour power. Mobility, a euphemism for immigration
for the first class citizen, that is with an indigenous slave passport.
If it’s ever more unbearable to continue working, in these conditions of
submission and growing control, it’s also ever more difficult to survive
without working. That is, it’s more and more difficult to obtain the means
of subsistence without working.
<p>Our lives are invaded by cybernetic images which distract yet stupefy.
The television is the summit: a girl in her room with a video watches how
Michael Jackson fucks Mickey Mouse, while a woman buys a shoe polisher
thanks to interactive television. The computer decomposes the child’s Martian
neurones as he desperately tries to kill aliens even though the remote
control doesn’t work. Speech disappears, only Capital, the <i>raisond’&eacute;tat</i>
speaks. They technically organise and control the solitude which they oblige
us to live in. The microchip does piece work in an isolated way. The State
is the heart of what we live most intimately, it controls the aspects of
daily life, and diverts it to its liking.
<p>By atomising and breaking down communication between people, by invading
private life, the State tries to distort the struggle which seems to be
led against it.
<p>There is nothing without the State. Everything must take place under
the State’s surveillance, with the protection and the benediction of politics.
It is the most important gain of the second world war. The democratic State
affirms itself as the only valid and recognised speaker, the only valid
and recognised mediator, and the only valid and recognised communicator
of ideas.
<p>Democracy is the illusion of communication. Through it and in it politicians
express their ideas which end up becoming those of the majority. The Power
to be able to communicate and to know how to communicate between us is
taken away from us, the words on our lips are erased so as to be substituted
by ideological lies.
<p>Democracy is nothing other than the appropriation of communication (the
power to communicate) by politicians who convert themselves into representatives
and delegates of our never expressed ideas.
<p>Democracy is the appearance of the confrontation of rival lies which
complement one another and to which the only and primordial end is to preserve
the <i>raison d’&eacute;tat</i>.
<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">What the telly doesn’t show doesn’t exist</font></u></h2>
Whatever is excluded, whatever is situated outside of its reality and its
lie does not exist. And so if you see something, it’s not what you’ve seen
but what the telly says which is reality. It resembles a lie, but it works
very well for them. There are people who see not with their own eyes but
only through the eyes of the State, be it by fear, or out of the apathy
of their cerebral microchips.
<p>Fucking society (11) based on information! Microelectronics, genetics,
control, ecology, services, post-industrialism in the centres, industrialisation
in the semi-periphery, and war in the periphery.
<p>The crisis which is imposed on us allows the headlong rush of Capitalism
to continue to reproduce itself...
<p>The Society of the Spectacle, of Commodity, of Control has come along
and has developed itself in terms which go well beyond the predictions
and observations of the situationists. At the same time, for us the crisis
is the fear of the dole and the police in the heart of our lives.
<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">They have announced the crisis, we have always
been in crisis</font></u></h2>
Under the pretext of the crisis they justify the necessity of tightening
the grip of exploitation and control of the population. It all depends
on "how far people are ready to go". From the worker of well-being, to
precariousness. Loss of a century of concessions and conquests. But in
this country we’ve never known the "welfare State". We’ve always known
the "welfare of the State".
<p>The general strike is a part of the function of trade-unions in the
middle of domination. They move forwards in creating a movement so as to
channel the dissatisfaction due to the increase in exploitation which means
the crisis and all of the juridico-economic consequences which it provokes:
new laws on employment and the decrease in social costs. Social dissatisfaction
is held back so that it doesn’t get dangerous.
<p>The trade-unions saw themselves rejected several times for their role
in the polico-socio-economic spectacle. That’s why during the capitalist
offensive of reconversion in 1992, and during the crisis which followed,
they had to radicalize themselves in appearance so as to continue playing
their role, that is, so as to continue existing. They now transform the
weapon of the strike into an inoffensive show with data and political numbers.
These trade-union shows are directed against ourselves and our own...
<p>In the same way in which the individual has been converted into an isolated
producer consumer, struggles remain isolated inside of the circus of information.
We must struggle as much against the atomisation which they impose on us
as against the isolation of our collectives and the struggles against power.
And thus the importance of communication, the diffusion of our speech,
and of collective practices which ought to speak for themselves without
resorting to ideological justifications, flags, uniforms, or acronyms.
<p>Turn the tables on the use that State-capital gives to streets. Circulation
of cars and of commodities, shop window of solitude. Faced with boredom
and the binomial money-amusement, seeking a really amusing time out. That
is re-creative of life. Subversive of order.
<p>Reaffirming acts of insubordination on all levels. When insubordination
is real (refuse of dialogue with Power) carries with it a victory because
Democracy needs a question-and-answer so as to function. A theory and practice
debate is needed on the forms of struggles to take. Experimenting the forms
of our struggles and those of those close to us.
<p>Foreign to ourselves, cancelled, alienated. This world is a world foreign
to us and in which life no longer belongs to us. This world does not affirm
us, on the contrary it negates us. That’s why we can only think in negative
terms. There is no other alternative, <i>if the economy is in crisis, may
it die!</i>
<h3>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">Notes</font></u></h3>
1. The following text is an extract from a debate published some years
ago (1995-96) in the issue #8 of the periodical Akefalos (Apartado de Correos
37120-08080 Barcelona, Spain). A photocopy of the full text is available
at our central address. The editors of "Akefalos" explain the name of the
journal as follows: <i>"Greek mythology describes a group of people without
heads, with neither leaders nor subordination. Because we are people who
have lost our heads, in the sense that it’s considered impossible. Eccentric
beings with no common sense, we fight against the social normality of slaves
and their masters."</i> The notes at the bottom of the pages are from the
editors of <i>Communism</i>.
<p>2. The bluff of ’92 which is mentioned here refers to the World Fair
in Seville, the commemoration of the 500 years since the "discovery" of
the Americas, the Olympic Games in Barcelona... If in some ways this article
refers to Spain the reader will quickly notice that other aspects are clearly
valid in a much wider way. This is what incited us to publish this text.
<p>3. In Spain the <i>transici&oacute;n</i> is the period of "democratisation
of franquism" during which the state reorganised itself thanks to the management
of the Spanish Socialist Labour Party (PSOE).
<p>4. One of the aspects which we liked about this text is that comrades
having a different political formation and ideas different from ours, should
come to formulate in such precise terms things so similar to what we express
about society. The contents of the following sentence for example seems
very clear to us, even if we doubtless would have formulated it differently,
in saying that democracy (not only political, but social and economic,
integral democracy) destroys communication within our class, by negating
associative ties. In the same way we perfectly see how democracy "displaces
the very language of the oppressed", because it disintegrates them as a
class, because it atomises, because it transforms them into buyers and
sellers, into useful idiots and citizens.
<p>5. What is described here is applicable to far more than just "throughout
Europe".
<p>6. The authors of the article are completely right to affirm that money
separates men. But they consider this to be something relatively local
or new, yet it’s a phenomenon generalised to all of the capitalist world
for several centuries. In the "Manuscripts of 1843/44", Marx makes reference
to previous centuries and perfectly describes the way the community of
money eliminates the community of men. We do not deny that things get worse
as they go along and that’s why we agree to underline this, as does Akefalos
which tries to express a qualitative leap in the dehumanisation of human
relations due to money. But we ought never to forget that these elements
are the very essence of the world capitalist system, a system which humanity
endures since at least <i>5 centuries</i>, and not only in Europe but in
<i>all
the world</i>.
<p>7. The opposition between workers’ assemblies and trade-unions as apparatuses
of the capital is logical in certain circumstances, when the trade-union
bureaucratism is such that the trade-unions don’t function on the basis
of factory assemblies. But we ought not forget that when the radicalisation
of the proletariat is important, the trade-unions also function on the
basis of "workers’ assemblies" so as to better carry out their function
of containing and liquidating proletarian struggles.
<p>8. Contrary to other affirmations of this text which are valid for the
rest of the world, what is affirmed here touches a specific reality in
Spain. Indeed, even if all of the world trade-unions constitute apparatuses
of the State, and though we’ve seen through these last years a decrease
in the number of trade-union members and thus a decrease in the control
over the working class, the explanation for such a meagre percentage of
trade-union members typical of Spain is to be found today in the weakening
of the trade-unions which a left government systematically implicates in
its management business. And indeed what credibility must remain in the
trade-union protests coming from parties and organisations which share
the government? It’s so as to regain credibility that the trade-unions
and the parties so often need an "opposition treatment".
<p>9. The use of terms such as <i>"developing countries"</i> and the dichotomy
between countries which it implies constitutes in such a clear text surprising
ideological concessions to public opinion and the vision of the world imposed
by the media.
<p>10. At other times we have already noted that the instructions
<i>"self-management
= self-exploitation"</i> is not accurate, despite the propaganda power
which it contains. The subject of exploitation is always
<i>capital</i>
and never oneself as the formulation "self-exploitation" seems to indicate.
More so, the object of exploitation, the exploited, is always the proletariat,
the proletarians. Through this sort of formulation branded against those
who praise self-management in capitalism, we want to remark that in reality
it is capital which keeps the management and control of exploitation, and
that with self-management workers, rather than liberating themselves from
exploitation, collectively watch over it so as to make it more effective.
It is a question of self-control, self-discipline, and in most cases even
a quantitative and qualitative increase in exploitation... but always for
the benefit of <i>capital</i>. And in this way we can see as the consequence
of this affirmation a certain confusion about the subject of exploitation:
neither the client, nor the user may be, in the strict sense of the term,
exploiters. And it does not make a lot of sense to put them together with
the tax department, which is part of the subject of exploitation to the
degree that the surplus value which the state appropriates is used to the
benefit of collective capital. But once more the tax department is not
the subject of exploitation, it is capital. The expression <i>"self-management
of exploitation"</i> which the comrades use further along in the text is
however, accurate in the sense that it is the worker himself who contributes
to the management of the exploitation carried out by capitalism.
<p>11. The term used in Spanish is "suciedad", a play on words between
"sucio" ("dirty") and "sociedad" ("society").

Despite the local examples used in this text, we want to stress that capital
is a worldwide relationship, that value develops on a worldwide scale and
imposes its rule on every inch of this planet.
<p>"The recovery is here, we must press on!" is what we hear day in, day
out. Newspapers, politicians, journalists, economists, etc. stuff our heads
by way of that mindless box - the television. They explain to us, with
supporting figures and graphs, that the recovery, even if weak and unsteady
on its feet, is finally back. They then go on to justify sickening austerity
policies by telling us to "Carry on tightening your belts and the recovery
will be even stronger!". The bourgeoisie wants to chain us to the defence
of the economy as well as to make us believe that this time we are really
"out of the tunnel" at last.
<p>As if "the god of the Economy" would bless us with some godsend after
having ignored us for 20 years! For what possible reasons would growth
(1) have returned?
<p>In answering this question, let’s first remind ourselves of bourgeois
terminology: what they mean by ‘recovery’ or ‘growth’ is an increase in
their wealth in one country or a group of countries (increase in the Gross
Domestic Product). Expanded reproduction is a rule inherent to capital
and this is how ideologists refer to it. Recession is an insufficient increase
in the GDP. Bourgeois rhetoric boils down to saying that "we" in the USA
and Great Britain are richer compared to 3 or 4 years ago and the whole
world is compared to one year ago.
<p>Behind that "we" lies in fact "the people", i.e. the statistical average
between classes, with proletarians and bourgeoisie lumped together. Quoting
a 3% recovery over one year is the equivalent of saying that there was
3% more wealth in that country by the end of that year. It clearly does
not mean that each "individual" is 3% better-off. Indeed, we will go on
to show how the bourgeoisie’s wealth has increased at the expense of an
intensification of proletarians’ misery. Moreover, since the 3% increase
is mathematically (2) redistributed amongst all, it means that the relative
increase in the bourgeois’ wealth is far greater than 3% and our poverty
continues to worsen. What’s the reality behind this explosion of wealth?
<p>Let’s talk about the USA, considered by the world bourgeoisie to be
the "star pupil". The figures speak for themselves: Since 1991, 3-4% growth
per year, rate of unemployment at 5-6%, 3% inflation rate and the creation
of about 2 million jobs a year.
<p>For several years, some American companies (3) have made huge profits.
Records have been beaten in the computer science sector by Microsoft, in
the pharmaceutical industry by Pfizer (several billion dollars), in the
car industry by Chrysler (3,8 billion dollars). Obviously, these figures
would give even the most blas&eacute; of stockmarket speculators a hard-on.
However, we set our reality against the one-sided picture painted by the
bourgeoisie. This is, therefore, another point of view, that of those who
produce the wealth, those who, as always in this fucking system, are deprived
of the enjoyment of their product.
<p>How can these companies make such profits? The answer is simple: they
lay off workers in order to reduce production costs and then put more pressure
on the remaining proletarians.
<p>The following is a quotation by F.Rohatyn who is, amongst others, an
official adviser to Bill Clinton and the director of a bank:
<p>"The race for productivity is accompanied by structural unemployment
that spares no one: blue collar workers, white collar workers,... and it
will continue. All big companies are now looking to reduce their staffing
levels. For example Pfizer, a pharmaceutical company that I know well beause
I am a member of its board of directors, have just decided to get rid of
4.000 jobs (10% through early retirement or sackings). And yet, the company
earns billions. We live in a rather frightening period: take a look at
IBM, Intel and Microsoft. They all have roughly the same stockmarket value
of between 20 and 25 billion dollars. But IBM has 150,000 employees, Intel
15,000 and Microsoft 6000. This means that the creation of wealth will
need a smaller and smaller but more and more qualified, adaptable and flexible
workforce."
<p>What this bourgeois is cynically telling us is that proletarians at
IBM sweat 25 times less surplus-value than those at Microsoft and 10 times
less than those at Intel. It is easy to understand why IBM has laid off
scores of workers over the past few years. The example of Pfizer is representative
of current practice.
<p>There are many other similar examples across the globe:
<p>• In the chemical industry in Germany, 1994 profits were huge: up 99.2%
for BASF to 1.209 billion DM, up 83% for Hoechst to 1.69 billion DM, up
32.2% for Bayer to 2.38 billion DM. Manfred Schneider, Bayer’s chairman,
stated that "there will not be, under any circumstances, an increase in
the number of jobs". Indeed, his company has just sacked another 3,400
of us.
<p>• In France, the 63 biggest French industrial groups made huge profits
after reducing employment by 3.5% in ‘93 and 2.5% in ‘94. They are planning
another O.5% reduction in 1995.
<p>• In 1994, in the French car industry, PSA and Renault made enormous
profits and reached record levels of production. To show their gratitude
to the proletarians who worked themselves into the ground, these industrialists
announced planned lay-offs of 3500 and 5000 workers respectively between
1995 and 1996.
<p>• In the telecommunications sector, the steel industry, the air transport
sector, the paper industry... it’s the same old story, as much in the USA
as in Europe, Asia or Africa.
<p>• In 1994, the profits of British banks increased by 100% to 176%. News
that will, no doubt, delight the tens of thousands made homeless by the
beneficial effects of the recovery in Great Britain in the same year.
<p>• In the USA, more than 10% of the population live in absolute poverty
and do not register in official statistics. Moreover, 25% to 35% (depending
on the source) are on the threshold of poverty. This allows us to relativise
the official unemployment rate (4).
<p>As for the number of jobs created in the USA (5), what we are not told
is that every year 2,000,000 low-paid industrial jobs (10 to 15 US$ per
hour, with social cover) are abolished, whereas 2,000,000 new jobs, easy
to relocate and with even lower wages ($4.5 per hour, with no social cover)
are created.
<p>Gail Forler, a cynical manager of capital summarised the situation very
clearly:
<p>" The well-paid industrial jobs of the ‘70’s are over!", adding that
"Neither new technology, nor new markets will be sufficient reasons to
create jobs. In order to solve their labour problems, employers prefer
to buy a new machine or to reorganise their staff."
<p>It is therefore crystal clear that proletarians who still have a job
will not only have do the work of those who have been sacked, but will
also be forced to work in a way that ensures the company produces more
than before!
<p>Still on the subject of the USA, the "mass-media" announced that poverty
has increased by 10% in 20 years. This figure is nonsensical: which proletarian
in the United-States can be convinced that with 1995’s wages he can buy
90% of what he bought in 1975?
<p>Figures on inflation are meaningless. All that interests us is that
wages are decreasing and prices rising! All the penpushers sound surprised:
<p>"In total, despite the recovery, 30 million people, that is a quarter
of the working population, are said to be outside the normal channels of
employment (doing the kind of shit jobs that we’ve just talked about, ed.)
and suffer the aberration of being both below the poverty line yet being
workers."
<p>Alain Lebaube, le Monde, Bilan &eacute;conomique et social 1994)
<p>Our very point, gentlemen! Work never makes the slave rich, but always
the slave-driver. If working made one rich, the bourgeoisie would have
banned the proletariat from working years ago and done the work itself!
<p>The reality or unreality of the "recovery" must be put in the much wider
context of the different phases of the absurd and inhuman system that is
capitalism. If not, it is impossible to understand and it becomes a religious
question.
<p>It is only possible to understand the "recovery" if we refer back to
Capital’s fundamental contradiction: that between valorisation and devalorisation
(see below).
<p>We then realise that there is no "general recovery", insofar as to achieve
this Capital needs destruction on a far greater scale than is occurring
in current wars, which are not sufficiently widespread to allow the devalorisation
required to engender "recovery". On the contrary, the crisis is deepening
and speeches on the "recovery" only refer to a "technical recovery", i.e.
a cyclical recovery corresponding to the short cycle of Capital, itself
determined by a relative renovation of fixed capital; it is therefore a
short term phenomenon that will last as long as proletarians continue to
accept increasing poverty (6).
<p>It is the proletariat’s apathy that enables the bourgeoisie to put some
of us on the dole, while stepping up the pace for those still doing paid
hard labour. With this kind of growth, the absolute misery of proletarians
becomes generalised. Infact, the only time when the bourgeoisie can count
on a fruitful and longterm valorisation is following generalised war: the
period of "reconstruction". It is a privileged time for the investment
and circulation of capital on a large scale, but which, for our class,
signifies an ever-increasing rise in relative misery (relative to the wealth
we produce).
<p>Reconstruction then gives way to crisis (crisis of overproduction of
capital) that can only be resolved by another generalised war, thus closing
the circle of death imposed by value.
<p>We do not defend any of the phases of this system, all periods of which
reproduce inhumanity and for which war is the only solution.
<p>We are not making a moralistic critique of "nasty capitalists" who are
too selfish to share the fruits of their labour with the "poor exploited
proletarians". No way! We know that it is Value and its cycle that impose
themselves as much on the bourgeoisie as on the proletariat.
<p>The so-called "recovery", drummed into us on a daily basis, holds nothing
good in store for us proletarians. Today, just as yesterday and as always
in this system of death, we can only look forward to more tears, more bloodshed,
more sweat... as much on the front of wage labour as on those of the next
generalised war.

<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">Notes</font></u></h3>
1. "Growth" and "recovery" are synonymous. Moreover, the bourgeoisie uses
both terms together, as in "The recovery of growth".
<p>2. Let us not delude ourselves. This redistribution is confined to statistics
and is consequently only a virtual reality - we proletarians will still
be poor for some time to come.
<p>3. Competition is raging: that’s a rule of the system. While some companies
make huge profits, others are either phagocytosed by them or forced into
bankruptcy. But the result is always the same for us - more misery!
<p>4. This is not specific to the USA. In fact, all governments doctor
their statistics. For example, in Belgium the official unemployment rate
is about 14% of the working population (approximately 500,000 out of work).
This figure obviously "forgets" that, for the past 10 years, anyone over
the age of 55 is no longer included in the statistics (roughly 50,000).
'14%' also "leaves out" the 180,000 who have been excluded from unemployment
benefits over last two years and "ignores" the 400,000 "ghost jobs" paid
for by unemployment insurance funds. Making a very quick calculation, taking
into account the 50.000 unemployed excluded for over two years, gives us
a figure of 1,180,000 true unemployed. In terms of percentage, on the basis
of 3,500,000 people of working age in Belgium, this shows a real unemployment
rate of about 33%. It goes without saying that this kind of criticism could
apply to all figures and all countries.
<p>5. Yet another example illustrating the terminology used by the bourgeoisie
to impose its point of view: "jobs created", "creation of jobs"... these
words creep into everyday language and tend to present the capitalist as
a "work giver" rather than as an exploiter. The State is not a philanthropic
association striving to provide us with a means of survival: when employing
and paying proletarians, the only aim of the capitalist class is to extort
surplus-value from them.
<p>6. This is one of the aims pursued by the bourgeoisie with their mythical
"recovery": to show us our immediate future through rose-tinted glasses
and thus to make us accept our ever- worsening living conditions.

<h2>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Valorisation/devalorisation: Capital’s unsustainable
contradiction</font></h2>
To valorise itself, value must be partly invested in constant capital (purchase
of equipment, buildings, raw materials...), and partly in variable capital
(purchase of labour force). As its name suggests, constant capital only
transmits its own value to the commodity produced, by way of work of course.
The second part however (that part of variable capital which allowed the
purchase of the labour force) has its value not only reproduced but also
increased by the action of the labour force, by work. It is this second
part that produces surplus-value. Indeed, labour force put into action,
living work, is the only commodity capable of creating value and is therefore
the only source of profit for capitalists.
<p>The competition inherent to capital forces each capitalist to produce
as cheaply as possible in order to impose himself in the face of his competitors.
To do so, he is obliged to increase the productivity of his company. This
productivity increase occurs by way of a growth in equipment and infrastructure
(constant capital) and a relative cut-back of the labour force (variable
capital). Consequently, there is less and less living work within the products
with a resultant fall in the value of the means of production: this is
devalorisation.
<p>To counter this effect, the capitalists at first try to catch up by
increasing the quantity of constant capital invested, at the expense of
variable capital... resulting in a reinforcement of devalorisation! The
mass of produced commodities will increase but each unit will contain less
and less human labour and consequently less new value. Value can only realise
itself if the commodity is finally sold. If there is no buyer, value won’t
be realised and will therfore be lost, resulting in a further devalorisation.
<p>With the generalisation of the increase in productivity, the quantity
of work contained in each end-product decreases. The same applies to the
means of production that produces these commodities. Ultimately, the value
of the totality of products and the means of production decreases. The
devalorisation becomes more and more violent.
<p>All this movement leads to crisis. Existing capital experiences more
and more difficulty in valorising itself. It is a period in which capitalists
are forced to lay off proletarians, to cut wages, to destroy stocks of
unsold commodities... Capital’s only way out is to destroy surpluses on
a larger scale in order to boost valorisation: thus generalised war. Generalised
war means the destruction of constant capital (factories, infrastructure,
stocks,...) and of variable capital: the slaughter of proletarians on all
fronts. In this way, merely a momentary solution to the crisis, Capital
obtains a brutal devalorisation by the pure and simple destruction of men
and objects functioning as Capital.
<p>Fighting against decreased value by destroying value! This apparent
paradox can be explained by the fact that the destruction of constant capital
allows valorisation to be boosted (reconstruction) since the proportion
of constant capital has suddenly dropped as compared to variable capital.
And off they go again.
<p>One could be led to believe that Capital follows an infinite circle,
but this is not the case because the starting point of each cycle is never
the same. Capital starts every cycle with an ever-increasing degree of
technique and productivity meaning that the accumulation is greater and
greater and the resulting destruction all the more considerable. It is
an extending spiral rather than a process going round in circles. As time
has gone by, the bourgeoisie has learned to delay the day of reckoning
of the crisis (by destruction of stock, restructurisation, fictive capital,
artificial increase in real demand...). But the longer it puts off the
fall, the harder it will be due to the greater quantity of surplus capital.

<blockquote><font face="Comic Sans MS">"Political economy conceals the
estrangement in the nature of labour by ignoring the direct relationship
between the worker (labour) and production. It is true that labour produces
marvels for the rich, but it produces privation for the worker. It produces
palaces, but hovels for the worker. It produces beauty, but deformity for
the worker. It replaces labour by machines, but it casts some of the workers
back into barbarous forms of labour and turns others into machines. It
produces intelligence, but it produces idiocy and cretinism for the worker.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">The direct relationship of labour to its
products is the relationship of the worker to the objects of his production.
The relationship of the rich man to the objects of production and to production
itself is only a consequence of this first relationship, and confirms it.
Later, we shall consider this second aspect. Therefore, when we ask what
is the essential relationship of labour, we are asking about the relationship
of the worker to production.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Up to now, we have considered the estrangement,
the alienation of the worker, only from one aspect -- i.e., his relationship
to the products of his labour. But estrangement manifests itself not only
in the result, but also in the act of production, within the activity of
production itself. How could the product of the worker’s activity confront
him as something alien if it were not for the fact that in the act of production
he was estranging himself from himself? After all, the product is simply
the resume of the activity, of the production. So if the product of labour
is alienation, production itself must be active alienation, the alienation
of activity, the activity of alienation. The estrangement of the object
of labour merely summarizes the estrangement, the alienation in the activity
of labour itself.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">What, then, constitutes the alienation of
labour?</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Firstly, the fact that labour is external
to the worker -- i.e., does not belong to his essential being; that he,
therefore, does not confirm himself in his work, but denies himself, feels
miserable and not happy, does not develop free mental and physical energy,
but mortifies his flesh and ruins his mind. Hence, the worker feels himself
only when he is not working; when he is working, he does not feel himself.
He is at home when he is not working, and not at home when he is working.
His labour is, therefore, not voluntary but forced, it is forced labour.
It is, therefore, not the satisfaction of a need but a mere means to satisfy
needs outside itself. Its alien character is clearly demonstrated by the
fact that as soon as no physical or other compulsion exists, it is shunned
like the plague. External labour, labour in which man alienates himself,
is a labour of self-sacrifice, of mortification. Finally, the external
character of labour for the worker is demonstrated by the fact that it
belongs not to him but to another, and that in it he belongs not to himself
but to another. Just as in religion the spontaneous activity of the human
imagination, the human brain, and the human heart, detaches itself from
the individual and reappears as the alien activity of a god or of a devil,
so the activity of the worker is not his own spontaneous activity. It belongs
to another, it is a loss of his self.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">The result is that man (the worker) feels
that he is acting freely only in his animal functions -- eating, drinking,
and procreating, or at most in his dwelling and adornment, etc.-- and in
his human functions he no longer feels to be anything but an animal. What
is animal becomes human and what is human becomes animal.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">It is true that eating, drinking, and procreating,
etc., are also genuine human functions. However, when abstracted from other
aspects of human activity, and turned into final and exclusive ends, they
are animal.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">We have considered the act of estrangement
of practical human activity, of labour, from two aspects: 1&deg;) the relationship
of the worker to the product of labour as an alien object that has power
over him. The relationship is, at the same time, the relationship to the
sensuous external world, to natural objects, as an alien world confronting
him, in hostile opposition. 2&deg;) The relationship of labour to the act
of production within labour. This relationship is the relationship of the
worker to his own activity as something which is alien and does not belong
to him, activity as passivity [Leiden], power as impotence, procreation
as emasculation, the worker’s own physical and mental energy, his personal
life -- for what is life but activity? -- as an activity directed against
himself, which is independent of him and does not belong to him. Here we
have self-estrangement, as compared with the estrangement of the object
[Sache] mentioned above."</font></blockquote>

<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">Bourgeois Rhetoric</font></u></h2>
The more society falls apart the more it praises work through its media
(1). It is, in fact, not at all rare to see heads of state, trade-unionists,...
devoting a lot of their hot air to the subject of work. They explain to
us that "work is necessary", that "we must build a hardworking nation",
that "we cannot live without work", that "there needs to be an increase
in productivity", "to rebuild the country (or to make it more competitive...)",
etc.
<p>Moreover, in general, it is usually those who do not work who make these
kind of speeches. First of all because, in principle, social rules forbid
singing one’s own praises. Secondly, if such speeches were to be made by
a worker it would be the equivalent of him wanting to create and perfect
the instrument of torture (work is torture!) that his own torturer imposes
on him. Finally, this kind of speech corresponds to capital’s need to maintain
proletarians as mere workers (2), subsisting to work, sweating out surplus
value and devoting the rest of their "lives" to reconstituting their labour
force... in order to keep on working.
<p>Far beyond the individual speaker, the discourse around "long live work"
is maintained by capital, this social monster, the single true subject
of this society. Indeed, capital is not only value valorising itself, a
social relationship of the exploitation of wage labour: as value in process
it has subsumed man and has turned him into the executor of its own interests.
In this way, capital transforms itself into the supreme subject of society,
simultaneously transforming its executors into mere puppets (3).
<p>When any boss, any G.W.Bush, any Putin, any company director or trade-union
leader makes this speech it corresponds entirely to his own interests.
Capital is speaking, so to say, through its own mouth.
<p>"Work", "Increase your pace of work", "Work makes you free" (4), "Long
live the heroes of work", are all slogans which constitute the real and
complete interests of the social class which lives off the extortion of
surplus value and which has organised itself into "national", "socialist"
or "popular" states... Its participation in surplus value is directly related
to its ability to manage capital or, what amounts to the same thing, in
its capacity to control the working class. What it boils down to is that
the best capitalists are those who can best assure the reproduction of
wage labour. The real owners of the productive forces (the bourgeoisie)
decide on their use economically and the most capable among them are those
who succeed in making the wage slave feel content with his slavery.
<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">The Useful Idiot</font></u></h2>
Some people assert that the reality is different when the speech is made
by a wage slave, a worker. Nothing could be further from the truth. When
a poor and miserable worker cheers work he is betraying his class, renouncing
its immediate and historic interests and, as a result, it is unable to
constitute itself as the proletarian class against capital. Strictly speaking,
he is a useful idiot (5) who continues to maintain and develop work and
who, no matter what his intentions, objectively contributes to the development
and intensification of the exploitation of the whole of the proletariat.
<p>It is all the more important for capital to have a worker extolling
the virtue of work, because, as an idiot, he is even more useful in convincing
other workers to resign themselves to work and exploitation. From the point
of view of class struggle, his position is, without doubt, on the side
of capital. In objectively acting for an increase in the relationship between
surplus value and variable capital (thus positioning himself against the
<i>immediate
interests</i> of the working class in the struggle against the rate of
exploitation) (6) he is globally defending alienated work, the very foundation
of this society of exploitation of man by man; in doing so, he places himself
against the <i>historical interests</i> of the proletariat.
<p>This speech remains essentially bourgeois, not only because it serves
capital, but also because it is made by capital, despite emanating from
the mouth of an intermediary.
<p>In its own process of worldwide industrialisation, in the procreation
of its characteristic wealth and poverty, capital itself increasingly develops
the technical means to make its slaves work, to enable them to increase
their output, to leave their lives behind in things which are, after all,
their non-property, an alienated world of things which oppose, exploit
and oppress them.
<p>New methods, new machines, functional music, climbing the party ladder,
trade-unionist and political speeches, control of time and movement, promotion
within the union, "long live work" (even if stated by workers themselves!)...
all signify: everything for increased and improved exploitation.
<p>Capital has perfected itself and its methods for intensifying exploitation.
To this end, there is nothing more useful than a worker who shouts "Let’s
work!". In doing so, the worker reveals himself to be no more than a carthorse,
a beast of burden expending brute, general, indifferent, abstract energy
which is transformed into an oppressive power, into capital, which again
demands fresh blood from this same beast of burden to create more capital.
This process demands even more work, more muscular effort and, in turn,
this new capital needs to feed on life’s blood in order to make even more
capital, intensifying the effort of its own stooges. It is impossible to
ceaselessly renew capital without necessarily killing proletarians at work.
Capital can only exist and persist by continuously changing itself into
even more capital. As the enlarged reproduction of the exploitation of
work, it is a pressing need for capital, for its essence of dead labour,
to kill living labour so that it becomes more capital. It is this that
drives it. It has to pile up corpses and mountains of objects with no other
use but destruction, which is, after all, just a double way of accumulating
dead labour. Capital can do nothing else but become more capital by using
work, by accumulating it as dead labour, and, notably, by making use of
useful idiots who idolise it in shouting "long live work!"...The only way
in which this infernal cycle can end is by dictatorship against capital
and its society of wage slavery.
<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">The struggle against work</font></u></h2>
The exploited, submitted to work by violence, have risen up against it
and against the conditions of its realisation since time immemorial. Throughout
history no one has worked because he wanted to work, but because he is
obliged to, be it by the whip, by religion, by blood and fire and/or because
he is violently separated from the property of his means of life (fundamentally
the same thing). All of the exploited, whether slaves, serfs, indigenous
people subjected to "being discovered" or modern proletarians,... have
struggled tirelessly against work. Rebellions, escapes, partial or general
insurrections have always had closely linked causes:
<p>• struggle to improve the quality of the means of life and to appropriate
a less miserable part of the social product
<p>• struggle against the pace and intensity of work
<p>• struggle against lengthening the working day and for its reduction
<p>• struggle against exploitation to build another kind of society
<p>All of this can be summed up as struggle for living better, or simply,
struggle for human life. It is struggle against those societies imposing
torture and work, struggle to work as little as possible (as much in length
of time as in intensity), struggle to appropriate the greatest possible
quantity of the social product.
<p>These demands were not abandoned with the formation and development
of the proletariat and its historical Party (7), but were developed and
made more precise. Communism, as a movement of the organised proletariat,
struggles for the general reduction of work to its minimum expression (in
both extension and intensity) and for the appropriation of the social product
by the proletariat. However, it openly declares that these demands can
only be really and fully met by the revolutionary dictatorship of the proletariat
which will lead the world against all current norms (dictatorship against
exchange value) according to the needs of a developing humanity. Against
all bourgeois socialisms which claim that work is inherent to human beings
and conceive socialism as a simple process taking goods from the "rich"
and distributing them amongst the "poor", communism establishes not only
the need to revolutionise distribution (after all, merely a consequence
indissociably linked with production), but also <i>to destroy the very
foundations of the mode of production</i>. Thus it fundamentally revolutionises
the very objective of production, so that it is no longer determined by
the rate of profit but by the improvement of life, in order to lighten
work and thus to work less. This implies the liquidation of money, mercantilism,
and wage labour. Only this destruction can create the basis upon which
work will no longer be work, so that productive activity in general can
be reintegrated into the very life of man.
<p>The development of capitalism is the simultaneous and contradictory
development of the bourgeoisie and counter-revolution on one side and the
proletariat and its programme on the other. Struggle against work, for
the appropriation of the social product, for revolution, is generated by
capital, at the same time generating the development and strengthening
of the reaction. Each reduction in labour time has been compensated for
by increases in the productivity of work and through greater intensity:
in the workshop, the factory, on the assembly line, by Taylorism... and
by "new methods in work management". The development of the social-democratic
parties and parties of labour, bourgeois trade-unionism, labourism and
more recently Stalinism, national-socialism, populism (in all of its variations,
including Peronism, Castrism,...) was simultaneous and in perfect accordance
with this process. The whole of the bourgeois forces and parties take the
praise of work as <i>the ideological centre of their campaigns</i> in order
to contain the workers and thus have them at their service.
<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">The development of parties of work</font></u></h2>
The bourgeoisie’s praise of work constituted itself into a party from the
middle of the last century onwards. Up until then bourgeois parties for
workers were just called "popular", but from then on, the bourgeois currents
most able to contain workers called themselves "socialist parties", "workers
parties", "social-democratic parties" and "labour parties"...
<p>Lasalle’s party, German social-democracy and, later on, all of international
social-democracy, were classic examples of bourgeois parties (in their
programme, their life, their actions...). These parties were primarily
made up of workers and made the praise of work and workers the fundamental
point of their programme. The bourgeois ideology of work as the source
of all wealth (8) was both the centrepiece of the theory and the objective
of the party and of socialism. The "emancipation of work" was declared
as a slogan, always accompanied by others such as "for the constitution
of a free and popular state" (9). In the same way that the more the state
frees itself, the more it oppresses civil society, the emancipation of
work can only signify the fortification of capitalism (10).
<p>After Marx’s death, social-democracy tried to make itself "Marxist",
without fundamentally changing its Lasallian programme (praise of work).
It suppressed and falsified everything subversive and revolutionary in
Marx’s work, thus creating what was called (and still is today) "Marxism"
- the most repugnant praise of work and off workers that exists.
<p>Little by little, the things that Marx’s work referred to as being disastrous,
such as <i>the being of the worker and work</i>, and which had been denounced
as being the pinnacle of brutalisation, of inhumanity, of baseness... became
a necessity, an honour for "Marxists" across the globe. In the name of
the workers, these labour parties made the propaganda that work is synonymous
with man’s realisation ("work sets Man free"). There is only a short step
from this to Hitler and Stalin’s labour camps.
<p>And this step was easily made following the defeat of the international
revolution of ‘17-’23. In Russia itself, a real army of work was consolidated
as the counter-revolution imposed the liquidation of the revolutionary
proletariat and its communist vanguard. On the basis of the social-democratic
theory defended by Lenin according to which the development of capitalism
is a real advance towards revolution, everything was subordinated to capitalist
production, to wage labour. However, the National capitalist State demands
competitiveness and it became necessary to apply the most modern methods
for exploiting workers. Taylorism (11) denounced by Lenin prior to the
insurrection as "the slavery of man by machine", came to be considered
by Lenin as an administrator of capital and the state, as a panacea. Thus,
a prisoner of social-democratic ideology, he did not consider the increase
in the intensity of work to be the most anticommunist act conceivable,
but as neutral, just as able to serve socialism as capitalism (12).
<p>This masterpiece of the submission to work at a forced rhythm, which
reached paranoid levels in Russia, was directed by the great leaders of
Bolshevism - Lenin, Zinoviev, Trotsky, Stalin... They showed themselves
to be the most bloodthirsty in the application of new rhythms and methods
that capitalism needed for its reorganisation in Russia: Zinoviev turned
into a bloodthirsty dog in Petrograd, organising open repression of any
struggle against work and the state. Trotsky was the flag-bearer of the
militarisation of work, of the creation of forced labour camps and was
the leader of forces of repression during decisive moments... Finally Stalin
(later accused of everything!) brought this work to its highest point with
the labour camps, through which more than 15,000,000 workers passed. And
to represent the leadership of a society in which capital liquidated all
forms of struggle against exploitation, for the first time (and simultaneously
with Germany, Italy, etc.) "working" and especially "working at an exemplary
rhythm" were transformed, along with Stalin himself, into an idol, a God,
a sacred and untouchable beast. It was the sinister reign of the Stakhanovs
(13).
<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">Stalinism, Nazism, Castrism</font></u></h2>
Capitalism and its public opinion conceal the decisive contradictions (communism-capitalism)
and, in their place, present an ensemble of false contradictions (such
as "fascism-antifascism") which we regularly denounce. Despite the fact
that various fractions of the bourgeoisie raise different flags during
imperialist capitalist war (which is only the extension of competitiveness),
their programme is essentially the same. Fascism and anti-fascism represent
the same kind of society: capitalism or, more precisely, capitalism reforming
itself following the most important revolutionary wave in the history of
the proletariat, imposing the biggest and most impressive counter-revolution,
the reality of which we suffer to this day.
<p>Contrary to what they want us to believe, Stalin’s regime, as national
socialism, had exactly the same programme and fundamentally realised the
same as the national-socialism of his old ally Hitler, not according to
whether or not they coincided in certain periods of national or international
politics, but fundamentally because they based the management of society
on a <i>national</i> project of socialism. The central ideology is <i>work</i>,
in a <i>party of work</i>. Clearly there were subtle differences in their
speeches. Hitler based his rise to power on the defence of a socialism
struggling <i>"against international financial and usury capital (14),
against government, plutocracy and for a true socialism of the German nation"</i>.
Stalin preferred to say that his socialism (in one country) struggled against
"capitalist countries" and for "popular democracies". But Stalin’s programme
concentrated just as much as Hitler’s on an enormous effort of labour,
on heavy industry, and more particularly, on the infrastructure of communications,
energy and on construction "for the working people". At the centre of each
of these regimes were the Work Services, the labour camps, the praise of
work, and <i>obligation to work, presented as an honour</i>:
<p><i>"The obligatory work service ought to be an honour for the youth
and a service put forward for the people. It should neither provide economic
manpower to private industry nor be converted into a company competing
with the state. It should provide an army of workers who will successfully
undertake public works for economic, cultural, and more so, national political
ends."</i> (15)
<p>Today in the face of a situation in which every regime calls for more
work whilst eating less <i>"in the name of the workers"</i> (especially
in places where a party of national socialism, a party of work (16) is
at the head of the state, such as in Cuba for example) it is very important
to make it clear that there is nothing fundamentally original about this
policy compared to its predecessors, Stalinism and Nazism. This is why
we must emphasize the latter, undoubtedly less well-known than the others.
Nazism is not just one example of a party of work amongst others. It is,
without doubt, the most perfected of its kind, which its ashamed successors
(because they cannot acknowledge it) can do little more than imitate (whether
they know it or not).
<p>In reality there is nothing at all original in Fidel Castro’s works
and speeches; not even when he asserts that his party represents the struggle
of manual and intellectuals producers against the bourgeoisie, nor in his
claims that the access that workers have to power (represented, of course,
by the socialist party) has won them the possibility of administering the
affairs of the state.
<p><i>"The political bourgeoisie has been expelled from the political stage.
In its place, advance the manual and intellectual producers, the forces
of Labour (Arbeitertum), to begin their historical mission. It is not simply
a matter of wages and hours -though we must not fail to realise that these
demands are essential, perhaps the singlemost important manifestation of
the socialist will. More important is the integration of a potent, responsible
social body in the affairs of the state, perhaps indeed even taking over
the dominant role in the political future of our fatherland."</i>
<p>This is not a speech by Fidel Castro, but by the famous Nazi Goebbels
who, with as much cynicism as the other, is not afraid to add:
<p><i>"We are not a charitable institution but a socialist party of revolutionaries"</i>
(17).
<p>In what follows we refer almost exclusively to the Nazis. It is not
necessary to make an explicit parallel with every example through quotes
and references to the "realisations" of socialists. Every reader should
be able to find in his own surroundings some such socialists and Castrists
who have been striving to imitate the Nazis for the past five decades.
<p>All of the propaganda of the Nazi regime was based on the benefits,
according to them, that the working people would obtain with this regime.
It especially emphasised the <i>complete elimination of unemployment</i>
which would oppose "the decadence of corrupt capitalism". When France was
occupied, it went from greater than 6 million unemployed to a systematic
recruitment of "voluntary" workers outside Germany, to make up for the
lack of labour force. In reality this supposed "elimination of unemployment"
was no more nor less than an obligation for the unemployed to work, a general
situation throughout the world which was applied with varying success by
the whole of capital, from Stalin to Roosevelt. It was a generalised acknowledgement
of the need to resort to policies of public spending (later theorised by
Keynes), major construction, intense militarisation of the economy, all
the way up to imperialist war. For the German worker, as for any other
worker upon whom capitalist work is imposed when capitalism only has unemployment
to offer, the work is then badly paid, regimented, militarised and leads
him to war and death. At the time, things were presented differently. The
poor blokes who went to the camps (18) spoke of leaving happily to escape
unemployment and decadence, to go "to work"! The Nazis based their campaigns
on "concrete" deeds, on <i>buildings for the workers</i>, on houses and
resorts for tourism for the workers, on <i>wiping out illiteracy and on
popular education, etc</i>. The fact that numerous Latin-American, or other,
socialists have appropriated these tasks as the socialist programme only
helps to show how things are!
<p>The programme of the National Socialist Party wanted to <i>"give a Fatherland
to the German worker, to build wholesome housing with air and light and
sun for the vigorous youth" </i>(19), and the <i>Gramma</i> or the <i>Barricada
</i>(20)
of the time, called <i>V&ouml;lkische Beobachter,</i> aimed to bring "concrete"
(21) elements for building houses and "modern workers’ neighbourhoods",
with "new installations in the workers’ neighbourhoods", etc. In its regular
column entitled "Socialism in Deeds" this newspaper presented the classic
demagogic bullshit of useful idiots in the service of the state. David
Schoenbaum gives an example of the contents of this column with the following
(22):
<p><i>"They related that the employees of a textile factory in the South
of Germany had volunteered to put in extra hours and to put the product
of their work into a Nazi-sponsored fund to aid victims of industrial accidents...
that farmers had offered the Hitler Youth vacation lodgings for fifty thousand
children and the National Socialist Women’s organization of Mannheim had
distributed seven hundred more... Dresden municipal employees had created
funds to finance a squadron of five airplanes for the Sax Statthalter (governor)
to help SA and SS men out of financial difficulties and how they contributed
1% of their salaries - that is, accepted a voluntary cut - for the "promotion
of the national effort"... Other examples in the same series included the
completion of a suburban housing project and partial distribution of profits
amongst employees by Erich Kohl’s Prussische Zeitung... At Christmas in
1933, Party officials erected tables in the streets of proletarian North
Berlin to distribute presents to all, including former communists (!!!-Ed.).
‘This is the socialism I was looking for’ (No, despite how it looks, these
declarations were not made by Fidel Castro- Ed.), ‘and it was an honour
to have served it with every fibre of my being,’ wrote Goebbel’s adjutant
Schaumberg-Lippe"</i> 23).

In the same way, under Nazism, campaigns for popular
<i>culture</i> were
intensified, the whole education system was changed and modernised. Access
to education was generalised and presented, as in other cases, as a synonym
for human liberation and for <i>Socialism</i>. Indeed, it was about reorganising
the labour forces so that they would better serve capitalism, so that all
could obtain "the culture" (24); it was about promoting technical and professional
careers; it was particularly a question of profound brainwashing to subject
the worker even more intensely as a useful idiot to the national state
and to its interests. Those who were accepted and obtained their diplomas,
those who showed their haste to be the most servile vassals, were treated
like heroes:
<p><i>"The laureates were regarded as champions of the Olympic games or
as movie stars, they were very ceremoniously taken to Berlin and photographed
next to Ley and Hitler in person." </i>(25)
<p>This "social promotion" was obviously accompanied by an intense publicity
campaign. In the press there were abundant examples of workers who, up
until the day before, had not known where they would spend the night, of
sacked "peasants" who had nothing. There is no need to emphasise the melodramatics
with which such personal situations were described by the press "before"
and "after" they had "triumphed". Schoenbaum commented:
<p><i>"Given that half of the laureates came from families of waged workers
and that 80% of them had not reached the level of secondary education,
the regime succeeded, at least in this way, in making a spectacular glorification
of the working classes through its propaganda."</i> (26)
<center>
<h2>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">oOo</font></h2></center>
Like any other cynical socialist in the government of a capitalist state,
Hitler presented himself as the example of a <i>worker</i>. He had his
picture taken whilst doing <i>"voluntary work"</i>, as "number 1 in the
labour camps". Bearded bourgeois cutting sugar cane aren’t very original
in this respect either. The leaflets distributed by CEDADE today have pictures
of masses of muscular workers marching resolutely with their shovels and
other work tools on one cover and Hitler surrounded by soldiers, setting
the example with shovel in hand, digging the ground, accompanied by a few
refrains of the song from the <i>Work Front</i> <i>"our shovels are arms
of peace"</i>, on the other (27).
<p>All of this <i>"...undifferentiated glorification of ‘the worker’" was
based on an incessant call for social mobility, with an aggressive emphasis
on social egalitarianism" </i>(28). As in any other field, the example
of Hitler was given. In any regime of work there’s nothing better than
to show that its best representative is a worker who comes from the "working
class". In this, Hitler won first prize (29). In the national-socialist
party a real catechism was recited:
<p><i>"What professions did Adolph Hitler practice?"</i>
<p>Answer: <i>"Adolph Hitler was a construction worker, an artist, and
a student."</i> Whenever he could (and when his audience requested him
to!) Hitler would recall his quality of <i>"exemplary and persevering worker"</i>:
<p><i>"In my youth, I too was a worker, slowly working my way up through
industry, study and I think I can say, through hunger as well." </i>(30).

<font face="Comic Sans MS">oOo</font></h2></center>
The real transformation of the <i>1st of May</i> into a day of work, into
a day of celebration, despite it having risen up as a symbol of struggle
against capital, was naturally the work of the Nazis.
<p>In this case, as in many others, <i>Hitler carried out the programme</i>
which the bourgeois socialists, <i>the social-democrats</i>, had always
promised (31). The big parades and festivals that we see everywhere today
to celebrate the repugnant servitude of workers towards the national state
(quite the opposite of the revolutionary heroes of Chicago) cannot be considered
to be the invention of Stalin, Mao, Per&oacute;n, or Fidel Castro at all,
but indeed the work of Hitler.
<p>Indisputably, the regime’s main slogans were: <i>"Arbeit adelt"</i>
(<i>"work ennobles"</i>) and <i>"Arbeit mach frei"</i> (<i>"Work liberates"</i>,
<i>"Man
liberates himself by working"</i>). To crown it all, "ARBEIT MACHT FREI"
(32) appeared in giant letters on the gates of the biggest concentration
camp, Auschwitz. This was not black humour, but real belief in a rotten
system, capitalism decomposing, in a system which leads man to his extreme
loss, to the total sacrifice of his life on the altar of God Work, to death.
<p><i>"... the Third Reich offered a labour ideology, combining simultaneous
and roughly equal appeals to pride, patriotism, idealism... The centrepiece
was the ethos of work, focusing not so much on the worker as on work itself...
As in Josef Thorak’s colossal design for an autobahn monument, three egregiously
muscled giants heaving Sisyphus-like at an enormous rock, work was a favoured
theme of official art. Larger factories even erected <u>c</u>hapels whose
main aisle led to a Hitler bust beneath the symbol of the Labour Front,
flanked by heroic-sized worker figures; in effect, little temples to the
National Socialist God of Work."
</i>(33)
<p>That is to say, as for Stalin or so many of his current successors,
the worker hero isn’t the one who struggles against his own condition,
who conspires and, as such, exists as he has always presented himself throughout
history, big or small, with or without glasses, woman or man, in overalls
or wearing a tie, immigrant or "national", old or young, fat or thin,...
instead they present the worker as a working beast, as he who holds up
the whole regime with the strength of his arms, muscle bound, exactly the
same character that all regimes of forced work make fashionable (macho,
young, strong, national, nationalist, worker (34)). Commercials throughout
the world also issue this same archetype of the young, handsome, strong
worker bursting with health.

<font face="Comic Sans MS">oOo</font></h2></center>
Along with the idealisation of work has to come certain crumbs and organisation
of free time, so that workers are always in a good enough condition to
carry on working courageously, as there is no other way of maintaining
the highest pace of intensity of work and thus of exploitation. The Nazis
were once again the masters of all the workerist-socialists, including
Stalin. They created a special organisation, <i>"Kraft durch Freude"</i>,
known as KdF, that is, <i>"Force through joy"</i>, through relaxation.
This organisation, which was financed by the funds of dissolved trade-unions,
had an undeniable success in the containment of workers. Its activity programme
was quite vast: theatre plays, seminars, cultural events, subsidised sports
groups, folk and modern dance clubs, adult education, art displays, cinema
clubs, etc.
<p>Hitler could brag about maintaining all of the myths which allow an
important increase in exploitation in his nationalist socialism:
<p><i>"The people work decisively and cheerfully and they know that they
are not committing themselves to a struggle for the capital of a few egoists,
but for the good of the collective" </i>(35).
<p>The KdF’s biggest success was its tourist organisation for workers.
Here too, all subsequent patriotic workers and socialists are simply vulgar
imitations. The KdF managed to organise the free time of millions of workers
by sending them on organised vacations (one doesn’t need much imagination
to guess what they were like) and led the tourist trade, with the help
of subsidies, to an expansion unprecedented in the world. Its expansion,
provoked by the needs of industrial capital, were favourably redirected
into industry, in that KdF gave a boost to the transportation industry
through the building of two enormous ocean liners and the development of
the automobile industry, named <i>KdFwagen</i>, and later <i>Volkswagen</i>.
As we know, all of this directly served the war preparations and later
the war itself (36).
<p>Nazism sowed the illusion of the disappearance of classes through its
promise to popularise cars (which, in the most part, remains largely nominal)
and especially through tourism, both of which at the time, were considered
to be signs of richness, an exclusively bourgeois possibility. This enormous
and absurd lie, propagated by all of the important representatives of the
regime, was none the less profoundly rooted in German society. On the subject
of tourism R. Ley declared:
<p><i>"The worker sees that we are serious about raising his social position.
He
sees that it is not the so-called `educated classes’ whom we send out as
representatives of the new Germany, but himself, the German worker, whom
we show to the world."</i>
<p>And at the International Conference on <i>the politics of leisure and
free time </i>(37), Ley officially declared:
<p><i>"There are no longer classes in Germany. In the years to come, the
worker will lose the last traces of the inferiority complexes he may have
inherited from the past." </i>(38)
<p>But just like any other patriotic socialist regime which seeks out the
greatest exploitation and the best canon fodder for imperialist war, the
leaders have a clear awareness of its objectives. Some of them, from time
to time, have the courage, or the lack of consciousness, to divulge them.
Thus Starcke, press officer of the Work Front, declared with the greatest
casualness:
<p><i>" We don’t send our workers on vacation on our own ships or build
them massive bathing facilities at the sea for fun, either for ourselves
or for the individual who has the chance to make use of them. We do it
only because we are interested in preserving the working capacity (Arbeitskraft)
of the individual and in order to send him back to work strengthened and
refreshed." </i>(39)
<p>It is with this pearl of sincerity that we will conclude the chapter
about the Nazi praise of work, a praise so similar to that made by all
nationalist socialists. The reader must be sufficiently sick of this workism
and national and socialist fanaticism for work. Let’s return to our struggle
against work!
<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">The issue of workers consciousness in the
struggle against work</font></u></h2>
Despite all the speeches, anyone who can only live by selling his labour
power feels that he is working because he has no other solution, that it
is the only way left to him to subsist.
<p>Therefore, he works as little as possible and, if he can, he doesn’t
work, or, when it is possible, works while trying to live a little bit
(if this atrophied life can be called a "life"). He spends a bit longer
in the toilet, smokes a cigarette, renders the machine "out of order",
tries to communicate with other workers, slows down his pace, always tries
- counter to the situation - to act as a hhuman being and not as a machine,
as if he could rediscover a human existence while the boss isn’t looking,
during the break, or while hiding out in the toilets. Some are off work
whenever possible, others come down "sick", suddenly developing a bad toothache,
headache or sharp pains, pains which no one can verify (it’s not always
made up because, sometimes, out of disgust with work, some do end up seriously
hurting themselves). There is plenty of evidence that workers most often
fall sick on Monday mornings and in the days immediately following holidays.
<p>Absenteeism is becoming generalised throughout the world. Those who
sabotage production are denounced, responding as best as they can to all
the inventions for increasing the pace of work. In every factory and office
thousands of counter-inventions are developed to counteract them...
<p>Failing to see an obscure, but very real, <i>struggle between the two
antagonistic classes</i> of society in these apparently unrelated acts,
means closing ones eyes to it. In each of these acts there is opposition
between the struggle against work, for communist society, and the maintenance
of wage slavery.
<p>These are the indisputable, living <i>facts</i> which demonstrate the
putrefaction of a society based on work and the hatred concentrated within
each of its wage slaves... It is also a fact that "laziness" and "idleness"
(after all, just timid attempts at human and intuitive resistance against
work) are always considered to be crimes, without even mentioning the labour
camps designated for "social parasites" or "dangerous delinquents", which
in Cuba, for example, are synonymous with anyone who sabotages production.
<p>However, in this present period of counter-revolution (which the proletariat
is having a lot of trouble ridding itself of), these facts are not generalised
often enough. Even <i>those who do all they can, cheating supervisors,
bosses, the state, are not capable of understanding the revolutionary significance
of their own actions</i>. In certain circumstances they not only fail to
participate in the demands of the working class and in the struggle, but
even see the revolutionary slogan <i>"down with work"</i> as meaningless.
Even when they speak highly of someone else, they resort to bourgeois slogans
such as <i>"He’s a good bloke, a real worker"</i>,
<i>"a model worker"</i>...
<p>We all come across such cases everyday of our lives, people claiming
that it’s all just "a lie". Despite the socially massive scope of action
against work, it is carried out alone or in small groups (40). The <i>consciousness</i>
of workers generally remains <i>atrophied</i> by the bourgeois ideology
of work - the very players in the struggle against work condemning that
struggle whenever they are clearly and openly told that they are fighting
first and foremost against work.
<p>But there’s no reason to be afraid of this situation. On the contrary,
it is the situation in which communists have always struggled, against
the current, against the thought and consciousness of the majorities, yet
in their interests and for their action, trying to render the spontaneously
occurring methods of struggle conscious. What is most important, to be
distinctly subversive, is to make it clear that these isolated acts of
sabotage of work, which we experience on a daily basis, contain the revolutionary
power which it is <i>necessary to liberate</i> in order to blow this world
to pieces. That is why it is urgent today <i>not only to struggle to work
less, but to shout out clearly "down with work", "long live the struggle
against work!"</i>.
<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">"Long live the proletariat!"</font></u></h2>
Our enemies, the praisers of work, the parties of national socialism, sing
work’s praises, especially when they declare themselves to be Marxists.
As we’ve seen throughout the text, in reality, the proletarian is only
of interest to them as a worker. What they are really shouting is "long
live the <i>working proletariat</i>", "long live <i>well-disciplined</i>
workers", "long live the country’s development" and, whether they say it
or not, "long live the nation". This means, amongst other things, that
the bourgeoisie’s cheers for the proletariat are the exact opposite of
the fundamental interests of the proletarian situation and translate much
more clearly as <i>"work more, tighten your belt, the nation needs you"</i>.
Neither Fidel Castro nor the Sandinistas would deny this, for this is how
they cheer the proletariat, whose existence they want to continue for centuries
and centuries.
<p>When <i>revolutionaries</i> say <i>"long live the proletariat!"</i>
it is not simply different but the exact opposite, as much in its <i>premises,</i>
as in its <i>content</i> and its <i>consequences</i> - as a <i>premise</i>
because to live the proletariat must struggle. Indeed, for "Marxists" the
proletariat represents the sociological sum total of all people who work.
For us, the proletariat exists in its <i>confrontation</i> with the bourgeoisie
and this opposition exists in the general struggle for life, from the production
of material objects to the organisation as a party and to armed struggle.
As <i>content</i>, because the life of the proletariat is not found in
work, the proletarian lives by acknowledging himself and his comrades as
human beings and this can only be done through struggle against work. Finally,
as its <i>consequences</i>, in that the proletariat, contrary to the bourgeoisie,
has no interest in prolonging its existence as opposition to capital. Its
development, up to its transformation into the dominant class, has the
objective of the suppression of all classes and thus its <i>auto-suppression</i>.
<p>In summary, whilst the cheers addressed to the proletariat by <i>our
enemies</i> mean "long live the proletarians’ <i>current situation</i>",
the "long live the proletariat" of the communists signifies: "long live
the organisation of the proletariat as a class, as the dominant class <i>for
its own suppression</i>, <i>to totally liquidate the current situation</i>,
to abolish wage labour so that <i>productive activity</i> can, once and
for all, <i>cease to be work and can become human life</i>, so that humanity
may at last begin its authentic history as the <i>human community</i>."

<p>2. <i>"It goes without saying that the proletarian, that is to say he
who, without capital or land income, lives only from labour, a unilateral
and abstract labour, is only taken into consideration by political economy
in as much as he is a worker. Thus, in principle, it establishes that the
worker, like a horse, must earn enough in order to be able to work. It
does not consider him during the time in which he is not working, as a
man, but leaves the care of him to the criminal justice system, to the
doctors, to religion, to statistical tables, to politics and to public
charity."</i> (Marx in <i>"Paris Manuscripts"</i>)
<p>3. "<i>... On the one hand, the capitalist governs the worker by way
of capital and, on the other hand, the power of capital governs the capitalist
himself."</i> (Marx)
<p>4. See <i>"Arbeit macht frei"</i> below.
<p>5. The word "idiot" comes from the Greek and referred to someone who
did not preoccupy himself with, knew nothing about or who was not interested
in the affairs of the "polis" (city), that is politics, thus, by its disinterest,
aiding the tyrants. This is the case for workers who are disinterested
in the politics of their class and thus are the tyrants’ best aides.
<p>6. We can see the indissociable unity of the immediate and historical
interests of the working class, which the whole of revisionism has desperately
tried to falsify by separating them.
<p>7. The formation and development of which obviously includes as much
the highest points of its constitution into a class and therefore as a
political party (revolutionary phase), as the moments of maximal disorganisation,
dispersion and atomisation (counter-revolutionary phase).
<p>8. Criticising the first point of the program of the social-democrat
party (1. <i>"Labor is the source of wealth and all culture"</i>), Marx
said <i>"Labor is not the source of all wealth. Nature is just as much
the source of use values (and it is surely of such that material wealth
consists!) as labor, which itself is only a manifestation of the force
of nature, human labor power. The above phrase is to be found in all children’s
primers and is correct insofar as it is implied that labor is performed
with the appurtenant subjects and instruments. But a socialist program
cannot allow such bourgeois phrases to pass over in silence the conditions
that lone give them meaning. And in so far as man from the beginning behaves
towards nature, the primary source of all instruments and subjects of labor,
as an owner, treats her as belonging to him, his labor becomes the source
of use values, therefore also of wealth. The bourgeois have very good grounds
for falsely ascribing supernatural creative power to labor, since precisely
from the fact that labor depends on nature it follows that the man who
possesses no other property than is labor power must, in all conditions
of society and culture, be the slave of other men who have made themselves
the owners of the material conditions of labor. He can only work with their
permission, hence live only with their permission."</i> (Marx, <i>"Critique
of the Gotha Programme"</i>)
<p>9. See Marx’s critique which relates to this in <i>"Critique of the
Gotha Programme"</i>, as well as in the Marx’s and Engels’ correspondence
with Bebel, Kautsky, etc, during the same period.
<p>10. Capital is precisely the realised emancipation of work, the liberation
of work from its inseparable character in relation to the one who produced
it as activity. If work were only a productive activity, it would be indissociably
linked to this activity, and in other words, would be an integral part
of and a slave to the being of the "worker". However, under capitalism,
this emancipation is produced, because the process of work is dominated
by the process of valorisation, because the very realisation of work is
its negation as activity and what is left of it is thingified work. Moreover,
work has emancipated itself to such a degree that it oppresses the one
who realises it. And, far from representing the power of the class which,
for generations, has given it its life, today it is, as dead labour, the
emancipated force which the enemy class uses to perpetuate exploitation.
What must be called for is therefore not the emancipation of work - we
must emancipate ourselves from work! In the first conception, work is the
force which emancipates itself. In our conception, it is man who emancipates
himself from work.
<p>11. Taylor was a bourgeois who was extremely lucid about his class interests.
In order to understand all the subterfuges that our class uses to work
as little as possible, he worked as a worker for a good while and, on the
basis of this, developed a series of norms to eliminate "dead time". His
science consisted of controlling time and movement, to make the administration
of work scientific, to promote methods of "retribution" of workers, thus
increasing competitiveness between them, so that only workers would remain
and the "layabouts" would be forced to find work elsewhere, etc.
<p>12. <i>"Learning to work is the task that the power of the soviets must
expose to the people to its full extent. Capitalism’s last word on this
subject is the Taylor system, which links all the progress of capitalism,
the refined cruelty of bourgeois exploitation, with the most precious scientific
conquests (for Lenin, as for every vulgar materialist, science is neutral
- Ed) relating to the analysis of mechaniccal movements in work, the suppression
of superfluous and clumsy movements, the introduction of the best systems
of accounting and of control, etc. The Republic of the Soviets must make
its own the precious conquests of science and technology in this field,
whatever it costs. We can realise socialism precisely in the sense that
we will be capable of combining the power of the soviets and the soviet
system of management with the most recent progress of capitalism. It is
necessary to organise the study and teaching of the Taylor system in Russia,
its experimentation and its systematic adaptation."</i> (Lenin in <i>"The
immediate tasks of the Soviet power"</i>- 1918)
<p>13. The name came from a Stalinist mine worker famous for his physical
ability, like a human beast, to work, in the same length of time, far more
than his work "comrades" (supposing that they considered him as such) and
who was adopted as a hero, an example. In reality, capitalism has no other
ideal of the working man than the Stakhanovs.
<p>14. Adolf Hitler - <i>"Mein Kampf"</i>. Hitler added that it is <i>"the
most important programmatical point".</i>
<p>15. Konstantin Hierl, Nazi chief Minister of Work.
<p>16. It is evident that <i>all</i> of the bourgeoisie make an apology
of work, but here we are taking the most representative sectors of this
apology by capital, the governments and parties in which work and the "heroes
of work" were at the centre of all the economic and social policy.
<p>17. Quotation from <i>"The Brown Revolution"</i>, by Davis Schoenbaum,
(pages 51 and 52).
<p>18. It must be taken into account that the massive internment of workers
in camps was done under in the full view and the full knowledge of the
worldwide bourgeoisie and that there was no lack of bourgeois organisations,
including Jewish ones, contributing to this criminal business.

<p>20. Official newspapers of <i>"realised Socialism"</i> in Cuba and <i>"in

<p>21. There is no doubt that it is precisely this area of the <i>"concrete"</i>,
of the <i>"particular"</i> and of <i>"the solution to everyone’s problems"</i>
that lends itself best to official demagogy and to the generalised lies
on which a regime founds its propaganda.
<p>22. See Schoenbaum’s book, as above, pages 84 and 85. This is anecdotal
and it may seem absurd to include it here. However, readers will recognise
in these <i>"concrete examples of socialism"</i>, as much in their form
as in their content, more than one of their enemy’s speeches.
<p>23. ibid.
<p>24. We cannot resist the pleasure of submitting the reader to the two
following quotations which illustrate the tremendous similarity which existed
between the Stalinist apology and the Nazi praise of culture:
<p><i>"Culture is the highest expression of the creative forces of a people.
It is the artist who is the inspired interpreter of this culture. It would
be insane to think that his divine mission could be accomplished outside
the people. He only exists as part of the people and the energy necessary
for his existence comes from the people."</i> (Goebbels, in <i>Speech of
the Inauguration of the National Chamber of Culture</i>, 1933)

Castrism, this is because Castro, contrary to Hitler, came from the Cuban

is that the bourgeoisie never loses the opportunity to confuse the issue
whenever possible, by making the class origin, the extraction, shine as
if it were the guarantee of something. In reality, as the Hitler-Castro
example illustrates, it is not class extraction which is decisive, but
real practice either in favour of or against the regime of wage slavery.

that followed, social-democracy’s programme was accomplished by Hitler.
In effect, it was Hitler, and not social-democracy, which declared the
1st of May a holiday, and in a general way, it is enough to compare what
the socialists said they wanted to realise, but what they would never realise,
with the policies put into practice in Germany from 1933 onwards, in order

<p>In periods like the ones we’re going through factory, mine, or farm
closures or "restructuring" based on massive unemployment are common currency.
In the face of this bourgeois attack which condemns it to unemployment
and thus to ever increasing misery, the proletariat can only respond by
struggle, by direct action. On very many occasions this struggle for proletarian
interests takes up slogans like the ones above as its banners. However,
contrary to what the protagonists believe, they do not reflect the interests
of the proletariat in any way, but on the contrary those of its enemies:
the bourgeois.
<p>The interest of the proletarian is to satisfy his human needs, to appropriate
a less miserable share of the social product, to be less dispossessed of
the product of his labour (the interest of the proletariat, as a class,
is clearly to appropriate the whole of the social product - both past and
present - to abolish exploitation, the state, and to suppress itself as
a class by abolishing all social classes). When the bourgeoisie gives him
the sack, the proletarian is fully conscious that this separates him even
more from the means of life and that, from then on, he will be even more
deprived of what he needs than in the past. Revolutionary militants will
always find difficulties in being able to express the interests of the
class they belong to in clear, incisive, agitating slogans. This difficulty
is relatively simplified when things are demanded directly, for example
"bread" in revolutionary Russia, "housing" in the Chile of Allende and
again in Naples more than ten years ago. In this case the interest of the
proletariat expresses itself directly for what it is, always with the same
outcome, a direct attack on private property, since for proletarians the
cause of all deprivation is indeed the fact that they are deprived of the
means of life and of their production.
<p>But, in the majority of cases, the interest of the proletariat is filtered
by the dominant ideology and camouflaged by its agents, especially trade-unionists
and journalists, by means of a whole set of mediations which appear necessary
(in the sense that this is the way it has to be) to the proletariat, and
which disfigure it to the point of transforming it into its opposite: the
praise of labour, of the company, of the factory,... It is important to
explain this process of ideological transformation by which the attack
on private property is recuperated and turned into its opposite, that is,
into the defence of our own exploiters’ private property. Even if we must
always differentiate the real struggle of the proletariat, based upon its
interests, from the banners or slogans which emerge, these do transform
themselves objectively into weaknesses of this struggle. Indeed, struggle
of the proletariat in which bourgeois banners are expressed is easily recuperated
and destroyed. In all workers’ struggles bourgeois banners imply an (almost
always) fatal weakness.
<p>It immediately appears natural to the proletariat that it cannot take
the means of life which it needs from those who have it in their possession,
although it would naturally be more human to do so. It does not even occur
to the proletariat to take what is necessary to satisfy its needs as a
human being (or if it does he is immediately put off by the whole apparatus
of state terror). In the brutal disassociation between the indispensable
means for his survival and his being, in this beastly and bloody separation,
the proletariat does not see an aggression but instead something "natural".
This naturalisation of the social relationship of privatisation is the
product of centuries of exploitation and the transmission from generation
to generation of the ideology of private property.
<p><i>The absence of consciousness concerning practical alienation practically
develops alienated consciousness</i>. With the same social naturalness
which assimilates this separation, money is accepted as an indispensable
mediation. In the same way that it appears natural to the human species
not to be able to use the means of living which it needs, which it produces,
yet which are within its reach, it considers it natural that in order to
enjoy these means of living one must dispose of money to buy them. In this
way, a historical social relationship just as specific as money becomes
both natural and necessary. As money appears indispensable for obtaining
the means of life it therefore appears as the symbol of all of objects
of life and even of life itself.
<p>However the question does not end there, because whilst money represents
a necessary mediation for the proletarian, he himself does not have any.
And any proletarian knows, even if his alienation does not allow him to
grasp any more than this, that to obtain it - apart from through a general
attack (revolution) or a partial attack (recuperation) on private property
- he has nothing else to resort to than woork. This not only means being
disposed to sell his labour force commodity (hundreds of millions of proletarians
find no buyer) but also meeting a buyer, someone who is effectively disposed
to hand over money for the sale of the only thing which he possesses: his
labour force.
<p>Not only does he consider it natural not to appropriate what he needs,
his own and exclusive creation (1), not only does he consider money to
be natural and necessary, but now even his labour, in fact torture, which
separates him from his really human activity (2) appears as something indispensable,
inherent to the realisation of his life. The alienation of his life, the
sale of himself and his humanity from then on becomes, from the point of
view of alienated consciousness, an act of liberty, the liberty to sell
one’s own labour force. Trade-unionists, politicians, do nothing other
than fashion this alienated consciousness into pretty slogans: "Protect
labour", "Struggle for free labour" (3), "Our laws guarantee the freedom
of each individual"
<p>It is obvious that the proletarian is at least conscious that he does
not work because it is his desire, but rather because he has no other solution
(4), that labour is not the realisation of his life but an indispensable
means for living and what he associates with his real life is always outside
of work. Yet this does not keep him from considering work to be a necessary
mediation for possessing the objects which he needs to live.
<p>In many cases alienated consciousness goes even further. To live one
must consume, to consume one must be able to buy, to buy one must dispose
of money, to dispose of money one must work, to work one must find a boss
ready to buy one’s labour force. But the possibility of there being bosses
disposed to buy one’s labour power depends on the profitability of the
company, on the national economy functioning well. It’s in this way that
even more mediations are added which end up turning the wage slave into
the most subservient defender not only of slavery in general (long live
work!) and consequently of the historical interests of the bourgeoisie
(the perpetuation of the system of wage slavery), but also the immediate
interests of his immediate enemy, his boss, his exploiter, the national
fraction of Capital which exploits him: "Defend the company", "Take care
of the machines", "Not too many demands or else the company could shut
down", "Let’s sacrifice ourselves for the national economy", "Let’s produce
our own goods, against foreign imports!". In reality, the boss, the trade-unionist,
the politician, do not even have to defend the need for all of these mediations
to obtain a "good job", a job to get money, money to procure the means
of living, since centuries and centuries of production of alienated consciousness
make each of these mediations (in reality artificial, or unnecessary from
a historical point of view) as natural as the meeting of the sperm and
the egg permitting the reproduction of the human species and thus the existence
of men and women.
<p>When the company or mine closes, or threatens to do so, because it is
no longer profitable, the society of workers bearing this alienated consciousness
reaches supreme levels. "Protection of labour", "of the workplace", "of
the company"... is made concrete by proposing sacrifices. Recent experience
has shown us that in periods like the present, even when a real proletarian
struggle rises up in reaction to a factory closure, this struggle does
not come to terms with itself for what it really is - a struggle against
the increase in workers’ poverty. There is, amongst the workers in struggle,
an almost general persistence of this set of slogans typical of the alienated
proletariat, that is to say, belonging to a dominated class reproducing
the ideology of its own domination and exploitation.
<p>Once we have exposed the process of ideological naturalisation by which
alienated consciousness assumes deprivation and alienation to be necessary
and natural, and once we have made explicit all mediations which, as precise
historical products, ideally consolidate themselves as eternal and indispensable
mediations between man and the satisfaction of his needs, we must ask ourselves
what is the duty of revolutionary militants in such situations, faced with
such slogans?
<p>Communists participate in all proletarian movements even if they oppose
their banners or formal leaders which, in general, are not the expression
of the real movement but only of its banners. They must oppose them openly
by criticising, mercilessly, all of the ideological expressions of the
bourgeoisie at the heart of the proletarian movement, because the future
of the movement is at stake. If the movement continues to struggle against
the boss in front of it, against the state, against capital in general...
despite expressing itself through slogans like "Protect the workplace",
it remains alive and the essential issue is that of direction, perspective.
But these slogans almost always end up killing the movement. When alienated
consciousness begins to dictate all the actions and the movement really
transforms itself into the protection of the company, the mine, the national
economy by accepting sacrifices,... the rupture from the revolutionaries
is total and the most they can aspire to is gaining a small group of militants
and starting to draw a balance sheet of the life and death of the movement.
<p>Yet it is important to ask whether revolutionaries criticise all of
the inaccurate slogans in the movement itself in the same way or, to put
it another way, whether the various banners that we have mentioned in this
text are all equally harmful for the proletariat? The answer is no, there
are different levels of alienation of consciousness which correspond to
the different mediations which we have analysed.
<p>The immediate interests and the historical programmes of the two social
classes confront each other through polarity. The slogans which are totally
accurate from the revolutionary point of view are those which openly and
directly expose in a straightforward way proletarian (and consequently
human) needs, that is when no mediation is accepted as natural but always
as historical and directly maintained by the state. In these cases, private
property and the state are attacked directly and the social polarisation
between revolution and counter-revolution is inevitable. At the opposite
extreme, all of these mediations are considered to be natural, slaves defending
their slavery, the means of their slavery and even their slave masters.
Worse still, the protection of the company, the economy and self-sacrifice
increase the competition which workers make between themselves, they increase
the global rate of exploitation and destroy the proletariat as a class,
transforming it into a multitude of atoms of capital killing one another
(capitalism is the war of all against all!).
<p>But it is the intermediate cases which are the most difficult, which
pose the most problems for militants. When, in their struggle against capital,
instead of struggling directly against exploitation, seeking to appropriate
a larger part of the social product, massively attacking private property,
proletarians ask for more money (wage rises, increased unemployment and
social benefits,...) the slogans correspond to the proletarian content
of the movement, the interests of capital are attacked in every way and
the interests of the proletariat are demanded. In this sense, the development
of the struggle and of these slogans contains the revolutionary struggle
(5). But the acceptance of these first mediations as natural is, without
doubt, a definite weakness which we must criticise and correct. In practice
the whole of their consequences can be harmful.
<p>Firstly, with the acceptance of the mediation of money follows an ever-present
tendency to accept all of the other mediations which we live. Secondly,
the demand itself makes it seem like the one who is prepared to make a
concession - the boss or the State - is no longer something to be destroyed
but someone with whom to negotiate. Thirdly, as a result of the above factors,
the state even appears to be a necessary mediation to obtain our needs,
particularly in the case of unemployment benefits and social security (let’s
take into account that, in the past, such crumbs for the maintainance of
the labour force were not handed down by the state but depended upon the
internal solidarity of the proletariat). Fourthly, expression of the social
product as money, as opposed to as a share, contains a set of ideological
distortions specific to it, tending to convince the proletarian that he
has bettered his situation when, in reality, it has become worse. This
last point, in a list which is not exhaustive, is by no means the least
important: the wages in terms of money can increase whilst the wages in
terms of objects decrease (due to inflation, the problem between nominal
wages and real wages). In the same way, the wages in objects can increase
while the rate of exploitation increases, implying a decrease in participation
in the social product by the proletariat (due to the increase in the productivity
of labour appropriated by capital, the problem between real wages -and
nominal- and relative wages). In the face of all of this, revolutionary
militants (6), active in these movements, never forget the critique and
the assertion of the interests of the whole of the class (the struggle
against private property, for the abolition of wage labour), at the same
time as criticising any possible fixation on these insufficiently clear
slogans. The revolutionary militant, specifically where wages and the struggle
for wage rises are concerned (7), denounces both vulgar traps (rises in
nominal wages) and subtle ones (rises in real wages) used by the bourgeoisie
to pass off increases in the rate of the worker’s exploitation and social
misery as increases in his well-being. The revolutionary militant bases
his action and slogans on the demand for a real attack against the rate
of exploitation, the only real struggle of the proletariat which, at the
same time, brings the struggle for wage rises to its final conclusion,
making its character inseparable from the struggle for the abolition of
wage labour.
<p>If we go from the proletarian pole of openly proletarian slogans to
openly counter-revolutionary bourgeois slogans, if thus we advance, whilst
incorporating these mediations which appear natural in alienated consciousness,
there is necessarily a point, a moment, where a qualitative step takes
place. We are not claiming that these slogans in themselves, rising up
out of this consciousness are either a proletarian guarantee or a counter-revolutionary
guarantee. We have already given examples of proletarian movements with
totally bourgeois slogans. Consequently, the difficulty lies in locating
the qualitative step by which a proletarian struggle is liquidated and
wherein the workers in the movement transform themselves objectively into
agents of capital, not only in the productive sense (which is always the
case) but also in the sense of defending wage slavery and the immediate
interests of the bourgeoisie (defending private property, its means of
production, and its rate of exploitation). It is particularly difficult
to situate this qualitative leap at each specific moment of the class struggle
without making it depend in a linear way on the slogans, while at the same
time considering the slogans as part of the real movement.
<p>Thus, for example, when the "the protection of work", "the protection
of the company", "the protection of the mine" are demanded, the movement
(if there still is one) kills itself. This must be clearly denounced and
is one of the most important tasks of revolutionaries who participate in
the struggle. But we insist on the fact that we have seen
<b>bourgeois</b>
slogans appear a thousand times at the heart of objectively
<b>proletarian</b>
movements against the bourgeoisie.
<p>When the worker shouts "Protect work", "Protect the company"... what
really interests him is neither work, which often he spits on all day long,
nor the dark tomb which is for him the mine or the company, but what he
needs to live better. However, he is not bold enough to proclaim his own
interests, society has taught him that this is not the done thing. The
radical trade-unionist, the leftist, the Trotskist, will say that even
if these slogans are not the best it is better to stick to them "because
if not we’ll isolate ourselves from the masses"(!!??), or because public
opinion is more accepting of the fact that "they are not making demands
for their selfish interests but for the interests of the whole nation".
The duty of revolutionaries is precisely the opposite, to see to it that
the movement assumes its own interests. This has nothing to do with the
supposed transformation of an economic struggle into a political struggle,
nor with the introduction of political consciousness into economic struggle,
as social-democracy advocates in all its various forms. Instead it means,
through the struggle itself, making conscious the real interests contained
within this movement for proletarian needs.
<p>When there really is a proletarian movement against capital (one cannot
transform a workers’ non-struggle into a workers’ struggle by the introduction
of ideas!!) the key problem is to assume itself as such, to break from
the whole ideological spider’s web. Thus reemerges the problem of knowing
what slogans to use in opposition to those of the bourgeoisie. The answer
has appeared throughout the whole of this text. All bourgeois slogans start
from a natural and logical presentation of everything that is social and,
in human terms, absurd. Contrary to this, the slogans which make the struggle
advance are those which, even if they appear socially as illogical or absurd,
start from the needs of the proletariat as human beings, and therefore
from all that signifies the real improvement of its standard of living,
to the detriment of the bourgeoisie and the national economy.
<p>Consequently the answer is not complicated. On the contrary, it is the
counter-revolution which complicates everything: it manages to present
even our own needs and everything that makes us suffer deep in our guts
as illogical and absurd and at the same time, it portrays our sacrifice
at the altar of the national economy as being most natural and human.
<p>The answer is to be found, to express it brutally, in the guts of all
proletarians who struggle. The right slogans and banners will vary according
to the circumstances, but they can never consist of accepting these mediations
as natural, of accepting the sacrifice of needs. On the contrary, they
are the real expression of these needs.
<p>To stick to human needs, against all attempts by bourgeois intellectuals
to introduce consciousness into proletarian ranks, is not only the line
of action which leads to revolution but is also what dictates to revolutionary
militants the way in which to act.
<h3>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">Notes</font></u></h3>
1. We are not referring to the individual worker who, in the strict sense
of the term, is not even productive but to the whole of the proletariat,
to the collective worker who is the single producer of the means of life
(let us also recall that he is also the single producer of all of the rubbish
which capital needs "to produce" to valorise itself, that is use values
that have nothing to do with human needs).
<p>2. On this subject, "From man’s alienation to human comunity" in <i>Communism</i>
n&deg;6 and "Human activity against labour" in <i>Communism</i> n&deg;5.
<p>3. Marx already said <i>"It is not about freeing work but suppressing
it".</i>
<p>4. It is only in the case of extreme tyranny and the total destruction
of workers’ resistance that the human being can be oppressed to the point
of considering work as an end and not as a means for living. This is what
Stalinism, Nazism, the Popular Fronts, and closer to us, Castrism, and,
to a lesser extent, Sandinism attempted. But the limits of such experiences
can be demonstrated by the ever-increasing number of proletarians accused
of sabotaging work who are sentenced, imprisoned or murdered.
<p>5. As the reader will have noticed, in this sort of analysis it is decisive
to fight the old conception of a separation between the economic and the
political, between the immediate and the historical, by showing their indivisible
unity, and by showing within each of these aspects, upon which social-democracy
has built its theory, the allegedly opposed or less distinct aspects are
contained.
<p>6. Neither those who are satisfied with these slogans nor the ones who
abandon the struggle because these slogans are not revolutionnary enough
or those who declare from the heights of their theoretical platforms that
all struggle for the immediate interests of the proletariat is historically
outdated deserve this name.
<p>7. Whilst reformists enclose the struggle in the framework of the increase
of the nominal or the real wage, the idealist isolates himself from the
movement by declaring that he cannot fight for a wage increase because
he is against wage labour.

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="30%">In our central reviews in French and Spanish
we recently published an article entitled "Against the summits and anti-summits;
bourgeois attempts to channel of the proletarian struggles on a world scale
and the invariant struggle for the proletarian rupture" (1) in which we
denounced the large meetings of the international capitalist organisations
as well as the official protestations of the bourgeois left, its parties
and its trade-unions (demos, meetings, alternative forum,...). This article
has not been translated into English yet. Nevertheless, we wanted to publish
the following leaflet that we received on our internet site some months
ago.
<p>The meeting of the G8 held in Genoa last summer (2001) have been the
scene of a violent repression. But this repression had already been launched
before. Many groups and militants were arrested and questioned during their
preparatory meetings. It was the case of the group "Precari Nati" ("Born
Precarious") who wanted to circulate in Genoa a leaflet against the summits
and counter-summits which they considered as huge masquerades. But Precari
Nati did not circulate their leaflet because the police raided their premises,
arrested 13 comrades and kept them for seven hours. Two of these comrades
were accused of possessing arms (Swiss knifes) and more than thousand leaflets
were confiscated. The militants arrested belonged to the following groups:
Precari Nati (Italy), Kolinko (Germania), Workers against Work (England).
<p>We reproduce below the content of the confiscated leaflet and want to
stress the clearness with which these comrades dissociate themselves from
the antiglobalisation ideology, and the strength of their denunciation
of the social-democrat current who only aim a t the "modernisation of capitalism
and who hope that their proposals (e.g. tobin tax) will be able to save
capitalist social relations, i.e. the same relations which "perpetuate
our alienation and exploitation"

<font face="Comic Sans MS"><font color="#000000">The war in Afghanistan
and its trail of antiterrorist measures in every country, mark a step in
the development of the general war against the proletariat!</font></font>
<br>&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><font color="#000000">Massive bombings or "surgical
strikes", massacres on a large scale or "collateral damage",... while putting
the planet to fire and sword, the bourgeois defend the peace of their world
of misery through terror.</font></font></li>

<li>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><font color="#000000">Special courts, military
decrees, "administrative internments", unlimited detentions, trials in
camera,... they sharpen their weapons to condemn all proletarian suspected
to break the public order, the national security, to break the social peace,
the dictatorship of the economy.</font></font></li>

<li>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><font color="#000000">Increase in the number
of the international exchanges of information, international arrest warrants,...
Lists are circulating with the names of groups or individuals to destroy,...
at this day, in the USA, 5000 people are aimed at.</font></font></li>

<li>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><font color="#000000">Antiterrorism is used
as a pretext to violently accelerate the spiral: decreases of wages, layoffs,
starvation, armament,... In the air, road transport,... the postal services,
the chemistry, insurances,... layoffs are showered, by hundreds of thousand,
in the USA, in Europe, in Asia,... On the other hand, in the sectors of
repression (armament, electronic surveillance, cops,...) they invest and
hire!</font></font></li>
</ul>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><font color="#000000">Facing the proletarian
struggles that "threaten" to develop all States support themselves and
unite.</font></font>

<h3>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><font color="#000000">Antiterrorism is the monopoly
of weapons in the hands of the State against our struggles!</font></font></h3></center>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><font color="#000000">Let's open our eyes and
let's recognize that the war in Afghanistan, in Yugoslavia, in Iraq,...
is a war against our own struggles!</font></font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font color="#000000">Let's open our eyes
and let's recognize that the struggles of our class brothers in Algeria,
in Syria, in Lebanon, in Iran, in Indonesia,... are our own struggles!</font></font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font color="#000000">To submit to the antiterrorist
campaigns, it is accepting the brutal reduction of wages over there as
here and it is <b>contributing to the repression</b> of our comrades over
there as here.</font></font>
<center>
<h3>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><font color="#000000">Our struggle is here and
now against what makes of us slaves of labour, of shortage, of money, of
capital.</font></font></h3></center>

<h3>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><font color="#000000">THE ENEMY IS IN OUR OWN
COUNTRY THIS IS OUR OWN BOURGEOISIE!</font></font></h3></center>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><font color="#000000">While the capital claims
to be socialist or liberal, warmongering or pacifist, polluting or biodegradable,
from the South or from the North,... it is always dictatorship of money,
of the rate of profit, and, from summits to antisummits, from referendum
to elections, it puts on stage the bourgeois who will determine what fate
has in store for us.</font></font>
<center>
<h3>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><font color="#000000">Let's organize beyond
the borders, outside and against the summits and antisummits and any other
structure of the bourgeois State!</font></font></h3></center>
