<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">A breath of fresh air in the crushing atmosphere
of social peace</font></u></h2>
The struggle of the proletariat in Albania brought a breath of fresh air
to the suffocating atmosphere of social peace which today, still far too
often, anaesthetises the reflexes of the proletarian class. By way of acts
clearly denouncing the whole of the State structures as their enemy, proletarians
in Albania have revived the traditions of struggle by our class, which
so many years of the defence of democracy - be it in the name of anti-fascism
or anti-communism - had thrown to oblivion. It is so rare today to see
examples of rupture from respect for private property, from the settling
of conflicts through the courts, etc.. that we are taking the time and
the space here to relate what happened in Albania and to develop a chronology
in order to define the most important moments in the evolution of the balance
of forces between revolution and counter-revolution in the country.
<p>It is impossible to make a chronology which is not an analysis, which
does not take a stand in relation to events. There is no such thing as
a neutral chronology, known as "objective" by partisans of free will. Clearly,
whatever the media allows to get through is immediately biased (choice
of events related, words given to what is going on...) and expresses, in
this case, the bourgeois point of view, which can only deny the fact that
in Albania (in the initial period anyway) there was confrontation of class
against class, outside of and against all democratic regulations. What
is objective is that any view of the events depends upon the point of view
of where one is standing, either that of the bourgeoisie defending its
State and its mercantile system... or the proletariat whose struggle is
the destruction of capitalism and the assertion of communism (1).
<p>Whilst the bourgeois press was indignant to witness such "barbaric"
methods of struggle, including attacks on banks, burning down police stations,
town councils, law courts, pillaging barracks (food and weapons depots),
storming prisons and freeing prisoners... on our part, it was with a degree
of exaltation that we learned that the movement of struggle in Albania
was breaking away from the never-ending demonstrations put on by the opposition
parties of the whole world (in Albania, the ex-Stalinists, rechristened
'socialist') and reappropriating the means of struggle of proletarians
against the State.
<p>Gjirokaster was won by the revolt on the 9th of March and on the next
day the newspaper Le Monde was surprised that the atmosphere was one of
enthusiasm, that the pillaging was giving a feeling of festivities in the
streets, that the fact of carrying a weapon brought a certain joie de vivre,
that the town seemed to light up whilst the anarchy was total, with no
more police, no more State... Because steeped in their democratic ideal,
positioned on the side of the dominant class, the journalists cannot understand
that such movements liberate in one go generations and generations of deprivation,
sacrifices, assassinations, emprisonments, etc, during which we have submitted,
taken blow after blow. Yes, it is pleasurable to break the chains at last,
to reappropriate all that makes us dream, but which we can never touch
because it is padlocked behind the barriers of money, prison bars... Yes,
it is festive to no longer be afraid and to find oneself in the streets
strong and united against private property and the State, against all this
order that kills us - this order that will only die when the jubilation
of these armed proletarians who have at last found the path of struggle
will be shared by proletarians across the whole world.
<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">From the collapse of the pyramids to the
uprising of the proletariat</font></u></h2>
From the beginning of January 1997, demonstrations of tens of thousands
of savers who had lost everything in the bankruptcy of the financial pyramids
gathered in Tirana and throughout the country.
<p>The building societies offering mind-boggling interest rates (from 35%
to 100% per month) had attracted even those in the remotest corners of
Albania. In order to invest in Sude, Populi, Xhaferri, Vefa, Kamberi or
others, to deposit a bit more money each month in the kiosks hurriedly
set up in the streets, the Albanians had sold all they could. Flats, cars,
herds, land had all been sold off. The sums paid to the first depositors
merely came from the growing contributions of new deposits and the collapse
of these companies was inevitable. Hundreds of thousands of savers found
themselves completely stripped of everything. 70-80% of Albanian households
were affected. Of course the poorest were, as always, the most badly affected.
<p>The fervour to invest in the financial pyramids expresses the persistence
of the myth which portrays easy money in the West, that merely sleeping
on one's income is enough to wake up rich in the morning...
<p>Up until 1990-91, the need to defend the myth of the existence of a
socialist Albania had kept the borders closed except for exchange and investment
with Eastern bloc countries. Then, as in Russia and the other Eastern countries
(the myth of socialism as a fundamental parameter for maintaining social
peace having served out its time) they began to talk of liberalising the
system, of putting an end to restrictions, of the possibility of everyone
growing rich... The wall was knocked down in Berlin and in Albania they
deserted the 700,000 bunkers that Enver Hoxha (2) had built out of fear
of foreign aggression.
<p>As in Russia (3) and elsewhere in the East the extent of protectionist
measures, alterations in imperialist alliances and economic and social
reforms marked a brutal acceleration in the rate of profit and deepened
in an even more phenomenal way the gulf between bourgeois and proletarians.
From December 1990 to May 1991, food riots exploded all over Albania. Western
investors drew back in the face of such uncertainty over the perspectives
of profit. 1991-92 was marked by the total collapse of Albanian industry
and the persistence of social unrest. From December 1991 to February 1992
a second wave of riots swept the country. Each time, the riots unleashed
pillaging, arson on police stations, public buildings, factories, shops
and warehouses (4)... Albania, classed as high risk, was seeped in international
aid to avoid a social explosion.
<p>The German, Turkish and North-American States gave financial support
to the Albanian army, to transform it into a powerful army, ready for confrontation.
But despite these bourgeois preparations, the class struggle has shown
us once again how a situation prepared by the bourgeoisie can become uncontrollable.
<p>The attraction of the myth of Western paradise is so strong that the
opening of the borders resulted in a mass exodus that the Albanian State
and also all the surrounding states, in particular Italy, were obliged
to curb violently. It was not a question of an exodus of capital, seeing
as Albania is an area of desertification of capital, but an exodus of proletarians
subjugated by the myth that going to the West will mean the end of all
misery. Remember the influx of some 40,000 refugees disembarking, in spite
of everything, in the south of Italy in March and August 1991. The slightest
rumour of a boat leaving or visas being issued resulted in a gathering
of thousands of young people in the ports or in front of Western embassies,
as happened in Cuba. As a consequence, this exodus continued to be the
object of a vile clandestine trade. The smugglers of clandestine immigrants
towards Italy labelled their clients with the term "walking meat" and the
cost of the crossing varied between 450 and 600 dollars (5).
<p>With the bankruptcy of the financial pyramids, proletarians in Albania
were still paying for the total disillusion which accompanied the gaining
of consciousness that in the East, as in the West, it is money that makes
and unmakes policies, opens or closes borders, accumulates in the pockets
of some by emptying the pockets of others. The myth of easy money is so
powerful that it led proletarians' smallest savings into the financial
gulf of building societies. Disillusion persists when one has staked everything
on them and has to leave all to them.
<p>In May 1996, on the evening of legislative elections which assigned
all parliament's seats to the Democratic Party, the flag of Vefa, the largest
financial company compromised in the pyramids, had pride of place in the
victors' gallery. A journalist commented <i>"Vefa has illustrated the miracle
of capitalism, the Albanian miracle, the miracle of a country finally tearing
itself from poverty."</i> The feeling of betrayal was very strong at the
heart of the population when the pyramids, including that generated by
Vefa, collapsed as they were so linked with Berisha's government and with
the Democratic Party (6). Even more so, given that in 1992 the Albanian
people elected with an overwhelming majority, with cries of "fitoi" (victory!),
their new president, Sali Berisha, as a liberator who, in the name of the
struggle against the tyranny of the Stalinist regime had managed to re-seal
national unity. It was at this time that an appeal was launched for international
aid to relaunch the economy in Albania and that the United States became
Albania's main partner.
<p>Today the situation is completely different. The bankruptcy of the building
societies shook up the social climate. Contrary to what happened in Macedonia
or in Bulgaria, where the bourgeoisie boasts that it managed to contain
the discontentment of the "rejects" with meagre compensations, in Albania,
demonstrations and other forms of protest became generalised, showing clearly
that the proletariat had not been put down by the State. In Skopje, the
government and the national bank urgently organised <i>"committees to compensate
injured parties"</i>, undertaking inquiries, trials.. Even worse, in Sofia,
in compensation for all, the government erected a monument <i>"to the memory
of victims of the pyramid"</i> (7).
<p>In Albania, the demand was <i>"we want our money, we want to be reimbursed
100%"</i>. All through the month of January, demonstrations became more
and more turbulent and the anti-riot police carried out violent attacks.
<p>When the government did take measures to put an end to speculation it
was too late, it could no longer control the situation. On the <u>10th
January</u> 1997, it took action against two institutions at the base of
the setting up of the pyramids: Xhaferri and Populi.
<p>Even the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund intervened to
put a limit on this type of enterprise. These institutions emphasised that
they are private companies based only on speculation, allowing some people
to get rich very quickly, but who do not necessarily meet the interests
of the development of capital which is firstly based on the relaunching
of production. On the 4th February, Tritan Shehu, deputy prime minister
adopted this viewpoint and declared (after having amply filled his own
pockets with this easy money!): <i>"We have resolved to destroy these pyramid
saving schemes, because the future of Albania does not lie in them. Our
future is production and we are going to work more and more."</i> He should
have said <i>"we are going to make <u>you</u> work more and more"</i>.
<p>The Berisha government was disowned as much by the worldwide bourgeoisie
as it was by the proletariat emerging from its torpor.
<p>In Peshkopija, commiserating greatly, President Berisha asked the large
savers to come forward (tough shit for the small ones!). In response, crowds
gathered in the main street. A hundred people attacked the police station
with stones. Six policemen were injured and then the rioters set fire to
the buildings of the town council. The slogans were: <i>"We want our money!"</i>
and <i>"Down with Berisha!"</i>
<p>On the <u>19th January</u> in Tirana, anti-riot police intervened in
force in the Skanderbeg Square to disperse an angry crowd of 5000 demanding
to be reimbursed for the sums they had put into savings accounts. The Socialist
Party was still in opposition following the (contested) poll in May 1996
and was profiting from the situation of mobilisation of the proletariat
to take revenge on the Democratic Party. It called for participation in
this demonstration, hoping to put itself at the head of a peaceful protest
movement as in Belgrade or Sofia. But this demo, as well as those that
were to follow, rapidly made the Socialist party and all other bourgeois
parties give up all hope of preventing the explosion of the terrible anger
brewing across the whole country, as had already been witnessed by the
confrontations in Berat the same day.
<p>In Berat (100km south of Tirana) stones flew against the buildings of
the police, the courts, ministerial offices and those of the Democratic
Party. Two hundred demonstrators were arrested. The Parliament called for
the army to protect official buildings.
<p>On the <u>24th January</u> in Lushnj&euml;, 100 km south of Tirana,
where the pyramids had affected the greatest number, demonstrators threw
explosive devices up to the first floor of the Town Hall. It set fire and
the two thousand people gathered in the town centre made a barrage and
prevented the firemen from reaching it. The demonstrators demanded reimbursement
of their money, which they had deposited in the Xhaferri foundation, which
had gone bankrupt the week before.
<p>Towards the end of January it seemed that Berisha had not appreciated
the scale of the movement and thought that he could put an end to the disturbances
by giving the secret police, the SHIK (ex-Sigourimi, the secret police
of the Stalinist period (8)) free rein. The more that the gatherings turned
to rioting, the more brutal the police became. The SHIK ruled with its
usual terror: arrests, interrogations, beatings, emprisonments, assassinations,
disappearances...
<p>For its part, the bourgeois opposition, largely grouped around the Socialist
Party, structured itself to lead its campaign against the Berisha government.
On the <u>30th January</u>, ten opposition parties, the Socialist Party
amongst them, formed a coalition as the Forum for Democracy (FD). The FD
demanded the resignation of the Berisha government which they held responsible
for the economic chaos wreaked by the devastating effects of the pyramid
companies and called for the constitution of a government of technocrats
to manage the crisis, whilst waiting for the anticipated elections to be
organised.
<p>On the 30th January still, Koha Jone, the most important "independent"
newspaper, mouthpiece of "independent intellectuals" (one component of
the bourgeois opposition) published a manifesto declaring: <i>"it is clear
that the anger of the people is directed against a State which has set
itself up as a judge after having acquitted the thieves."</i> The opposition
knew how to use words in which proletarians in struggle would be able to
recognise themselves. But for the opposition, the State they were condemning
was not the power of the bourgeois class, it was the Berisha government.
Moreover, the editorial members of this newspaper, the leaders of the Socialist
Party and other known figures of the bourgeois opposition accused of being
at the origin of the troubles were arrested. All the ingredients were there
to lock the movement in a bourgeois alternative: to support the martyr
opposition against the new tyrant: Berisha.
<p>On the bourgeois political plan, the picture was like this: in response
to proletarian mobilisation, the opposition designated Berisha as the target,
whilst throwing proletarians in struggle and members of the bourgeois opposition
in prison side by side, thus pushing the former to assemble under the banners
of the latter, whose only goal was to erode the movement by going to the
polls.
<p>This plan was intelligent, but did not take account of the revolutionary
potential which this series of demonstrations of proletarian dissatisfaction
contained. It is clear that in the movement proletarians expressed much
more than just lost money and the resignation of Berisha. Discontent still
within the framework of the bourgeois opposition was being taken over more
and more by explosions of class hatred against the State, as witnessed
by the frequent attacks on official buildings.
<p>But the border between proletarian struggle spontaneously directed against
the whole of the structures of the bourgeois State and the battle of the
bourgeois opposition to restructure the State was not yet clear enough
in the movement. This lack of definition expressed itself, for example,
in the fact that the bourgeois opposition was not driven away from demonstrations
(and equally in the fact that one part of the movement was demanding justice
from the State to sanction those responsible for the financial pyramids)
still leaving the coast clear to the opposition to take over the reins
of the movement.
<p>At the beginning of February 1997, Berisha promised that all those who
had lost out would be compensated either in cash or in savings books. The
reimbursement should have started on the 5th February thanks to accounts
of two of the main investment funds being seized. However no one had any
confidence in bits of paper that the State would give them again in exchange
for promises. On the same day, the most important of the pyramid companies
in Vlor&euml;, Gjallica, declared itself bankrupt, leaving a deficit of
360 million dollars and declared its total inability to reimburse anyone.
<p>Following this news, on the <u>5th February</u>, 30,000 people took
to the streets in Vlor&euml; (a port with between 60 and 80,000 inhabitants,
210km south of Tirana). As the demo was heading towards the port, the police
charged and tried to chase the demonstrators with water pumps and truncheons.
Masked members of the SHIK beat the demonstrators and took them to their
cars. The confrontations resulted in 2 deaths and a hundred injured, most
of these on the side of the demonstrators. However later on, a group of
anti-riot police were surrounded. Several of them were undressed by the
demonstrators and ran in the road in their underwear. The forces of order
withdrew!
<p>That day marked the beginning of a permanent mobilisation in Vlor&euml;:
every day started with a big gathering (at around 10 o'clock) which turned
into a demonstration. At about 5pm a further meeting was held to decide
what actions were to be organised for the next day. All the opposition
party leaders, present at these demonstrations, called for calm. After
a week of demonstrations, these calls for calm were still not heeded. Nevertheless,
the demonstrators slogan remained <i>"Down with Berisha!"</i>
<p>The Forum for Democracy called for a gathering in Tepelen&euml;. Only
about 60 people attended, even though the mobilisation was becoming stronger
and stronger. The movement occupied the streets and did not want to allow
itself to be distracted by speeches on democracy.
<p>These examples show that proletarians say "yes" to the opposition when
it demands the reimbursement of money tied up in the building societies
and when it shouts <i>"Down with Berisha!"</i>. However, when the opposition
calls for calm and reflection on democracy they say "no". But if <i>"Down
with Berisha!"</i> can mean <i>"Down with the State!"</i> from the mouths
of proletarians, then <i>"Down with Berisha!"</i> means <i>"Down with Berisha's
government!"</i> from the mouths of the opposition and leads to the demand
for early elections. The movement carries these two completely antagonistic
perspectives. These yes's and no's expressed in the movement illustrate
again the difficulty the proletariat has in choosing its camp. It finds
it hard to extricate itself from the bourgeois alternatives and reacts
positively or negatively to the commands of the bourgeois parties but is
still not at the point of defining its own direction.
<p>The tactics of the counter-revolution rested on this ambiguity, this
lack of clarity, which pushed the movement to leave the streets and to
take up the straight path of the vote to express its disagreement. This
is the well-traced path of pacification of the movement supported by the
world bourgeoisie which, making reference to similar, albeit less explosive
situations in Bulgaria and in Romania, never stops stressing the <i>"road
to salvation via the polling booths"</i>.
<p>In many towns the demonstrations, still within the framework of the
opposition parties, became more and more turbulent, there were frequent
explosions and the police became more and more brutal, making massive arrests.
<p>In Tirana, the capital, Berisha's party mobilised itself and a thousand
people participated in a rally for democracy and non-violence (as always,
those who are the most consistent in the organisation of state terrorism
prefer the rhetoric of non-violence, which guarantees them the monopoly
of the armed force). The SHIK continued its reign of terror. Its members
frequented caf&eacute;s in which animated discussions on recent events
had brought people together and beat them up.
<p>The <u>9th of February</u> marked an escalation in the violence of repression.
In Vlor&euml;, the police emprisoned at night those they considered to
be the leaders. The demonstrators gathered in front of the police buildings
and demanded the release of the prisoners. The cops fired and at least
26 people were injured.
<p>The next day, the <u>10th February</u>, still in Vlor&euml;, 40,000
people were demonstrating and set fire to the headquarters of the Democratic
Party. There were a further 81 wounded, one of whom died from his gunshot
wounds. In the surrounding areas proletarians made solidarity with the
struggle of their companions in Vlor&euml; and came to reinforce their
ranks (5000 from Fier, several hundred from Berat, Tepelen&euml; and elsewhere).
<p>In Tirana the forces of order couldn't manage to prevent rallies. The
tension rose. The demonstrators shouted "Vlor&euml;, Vlor&euml;!".
<p>The confrontations in Vlor&euml; spread like wildfire and became the
emblem of revolt across the country.
<p>Gjirokaster was taken over by the biggest demonstration yet. On the
<u>11th
February</u> in Vlor&euml;, 30,000 people attended the funeral of the demonstrator
who had been killed by the police the day before and the police behaved
particularly discretely that day. But tensions rose, looking like <i>"dangerously
uncontrolled"</i> confrontations could explode at any moment.
<p>Up until this time, the movement was marked by stormier and stormier
demonstrations, leading to serious confrontations with the police forces
and the burning down of state buildings (mainly the headquarters of the
Democratic Party and the council) resulting in massive arrests and many
deaths. But the fact of having made the forces of order retreat several
times marked a tendency to break with the usual pattern of demos (the State
maintaining the initiative in any confrontation) and this constituted a
significant qualitative step.
<p>The repression that Berisha thought would decimate the movement actually
had the opposite effect. Far from making the movement withdraw, it stirred
up combativity and reinforced the determination to struggle until the cause
was won. On top of this, the desire for revenge came to light. Not only
revenge against the police who beat, isolate, torture, massacre, but globally
against all that leads to this extreme situation, against all those hard
years of precarious survival without ever knowing what tomorrow will bring,
against all those promises in the name of which we tightened our belts
even further, against the torture of hunger, against intimidation, daily
humiliation, against all the social relationship of wage labour/capital,
against the State.
<p>The limits of the movement, however, continued to express themselves
in the fact that the opposition parties had not yet been thrown out of
demonstrations and that proletarians were expecting the State to give them
justice and to punish the fraudulent companies.
<p>On the same day, the 11th February, the government was envisaging declaring
a state of emergency in Vlor&euml;. The Prime Minister, Meksi, announced
on the radio: <i>"We must defend the constitutional order and respond to
an extraordinary situation with extraordinary measures."</i> But the decree
submitted to the parliament met with opposition from the members of the
Democratic Party who, coming from the region of Vlor&euml;, had realised
that such a measure would only increase the tension that had been particularly
heightened by arrests and assassinations over the previous few days. In
order to prevent the hatred of the police turning on the whole of the structures
of the State, the government decided to sack the police Commissioner in
Vlor&euml;.
<p>During the week of the <u>12th February</u>, the movement spread to
nearly all the towns in the South and some in the North. The demonstrations
became more and more widespread and the confrontations stronger and stronger.
There was another death on the side of the demonstrators in Fier.
<p>A further large demonstration took place in Tirana on the <u>19th February</u>,
which the police were unable to put a stop to. There were shouts of "Vlor&euml;,
Vlor&euml;!" everywhere.
<p>On the <u>20th February</u>, a group of 40 students started a hunger
strike at Vlor&euml; University. They appealed for non-violence, demanded
the resignation of the Meksi government, the formation of a government
of technocrats to ensure the interim period until new elections could be
held, the dismissal of those responsible for the television and judicial
proceedings against those responsible for police brutality! What a programme!
According to these students, the brutal attack on the standard of living
of proletarians who had lost everything in the bankruptcies, the repression
of the struggles, etc, could merely be put down to the fact of a few villains
who had abused their position of responsibility. To demand a government
of technocrats supposes that there could be a neutral government above
the classes! As for all reformists in the world, it was just a problem
of poor management which could be solved by elections.
<p>With their programme for restoration of the State, these students were
clearly on the side of the counter-revolution. The counter-revolution which
materialises itself in the proposed means of struggle: in the face of ever
more ferocious opposition, they suggested turning the other cheek. Whilst
a collective force was pouring onto the streets and starting to take the
upper hand in the face of murderous assaults by the riot police, they proposed
taking to one's bed, wasting vital energy... Why not get down on one's
knees and pray?... to move the State to pity, the State that at the very
same moment was receiving international support to pay and re-equip its
various police forces.
<p>Towards the end of February Berisha sent his Home Secretary to Germany
to obtain an advance with which to pay for new equipment for the police.
Other governments also expressed their support for Berisha's government.
The United States had counted on Berisha's government to make their support
for Albania a bridgehead in the region, estimating that Berisha and his
party would have embezzled the capital first in the contested ballot of
May 1996 and then in the collapse of the speculative building societies
supported by the government. Today, concerned to speed up national reconciliation,
the United States have put maximum pressure on Berisha's government to
compel it to engage in dialogue with the opposition grouped around the
Socialist Party.
<p>On the <u>28th February</u>, the Meksi/Berisha government decided to
clear out the hunger strikers who were occupying the university. A group
of plainclothed policemen, members of the SHIK, prepared to surround the
buildings. The reaction was not expected: many proletarians recognised
themselves in all those who are repressed by the State, despite the reformist
demands of the students, and thus took up position to act in the face of
police violence. In fact, the rumour that the police had been preparing
to flush out the hunger strikers by force had led more than a thousand
people armed with knives and guns to gather in front of the university.
The numbers kept on growing and soon there were ten thousand demonstrators
who, from the university, made their way to the SHIK's siege and attacked
it with stones. There were exchanges of gunfire between the demonstrators
and the SHIK, who entrenched themselves in their buildings. Far from leaving
them behind their walls, the demonstrators went on the offensive and set
them on fire, with the aid of grenades. Three SHIK members were set alight
and burned to death. Others who tried to flee were hanged. The total death
toll amongst these SHIK bastards was six. This is not huge when one takes
into account how many class brothers have disappeared, tortured and assassinated
by this elite corps formed by the best bourgeois torturers. Unfortunately,
there were three deaths on our side, as well as thirty wounded.
<p>The demonstrators had got wind of the government's hesitation to declare
a state of siege in Vlor&euml; and marched towards an army barracks, forced
open the doors and took all the arms they could without meeting with the
slightest resistance from the officers and the soldiers inside the barracks.
A heavy machine gun was installed in front of the university. Confrontations
continued throughout the night of the <u>28th February</u> to the <u>1st
of March</u>.
<p>These struggles marked <b>the end</b> of the initial period in which
the waves of protest and other proletarian expressions were still too much
prisoner of the expectation of compensation by the State and of the illusion
that the State, governed in a different way, could be fairer, more equitable,...
and the beginning of an insurrectional uprising in which the proletariat
no longer expects anything from the government and leads it to open war,
taking up the path of direct action against the State, of the assertion
of class against class. This does not mean that there was not a whole series
of ideologies, traps, bourgeois perspectives (which is inevitable in an
international period like this one), including during this crucial period
in which the enemy was organising itself to recuperate and lead a movement
which was slipping through its fingers.
<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">The insurrectional character of the uprising
in Albania</font></u></h2>
On Saturday the <u>1st March</u> the town of Vlor&euml; was in the hands
of the insurgents. The funerals of the three demonstrators killed the previous
night passed off peacefully. However, further confrontations took place
over the evening, resulting in five more wounded. Two other arms and munitions
depots were pillaged. Armed proletarians commandeered cars and left for
neighbouring cities in order to spread their movement.
<p>The gunpowder was already on all the roads, over all the cities, just
waiting for a spark. Those sparks flying from Vlor&euml; spread the explosion
at full blast in the south of the country.
<p>In Vlor&euml;, Sarand&euml; and Delvin&euml; the situation was declared
<i>"out
of control"</i>. Dini, the Italian foreign minister declared that the revolt
was led by <i>"bands of deliquants stirred up by left-wing extremists with
the aim of attacking Tirana."</i>
<p>In Lushnj&euml;, demonstrators intercepted two vans packed full of anti-riot
police and forced them to abandon them, thus disarming 40 or so policemen.
<p>On the same day in Tirana, the parliament was called to a special session
in order to debate the measures necessary to quell the revolt in Vlor&euml;.
That same evening, Berisha announced the resignation of the Meksi government,
a decision which had no impact on the movement whatsoever!
<p>Whilst the Forum for Democracy was denouncing a <i>"further attempt
by President Berisha and the Democratic Party to fool the Albanian People,
in order to hold onto the power resting on the theft of votes, on a speculative
financial system, on violence and terror"</i> and was calling for further
<i>"free
elections"</i>, the proletariat responded by real practical criticism of
electoral perspectives: Generalised armament of the struggle against the
State!
<p>On Sunday <u>2nd March</u>, in response to the resignation of the government,
Berisha's official residence, situated on the hills of Vlor&euml;, were
pillaged and then burned down!
<p>Near Vlor&euml;'s port, ten thousand rebels surrounded the garrison
of Pacha Liman, a strategic base. The soldiers abandoned their positions
and, finding himself alone, the commander opened the doors to the insurgents.
He was later to become the organiser of the defence of Vlor&euml; against
a possible intervention by troops still in Berisha's pay.
<p>During an assault on a barracks the insurgents marched into the soldiers
camp, not to attack the soldiers, but to take arms. Nowhere did the conscripts
in the barracks oppose the pillaging. On the contrary, soldiers everywhere
and even the majority of officers gave the rebels a warm welcome. There
was even fraternisation: proletarians in uniform recognised themselves
in the struggle of their insurgent class brothers and joined the movement
armed.
<p>The government had to rapidly acknowledge that it could no longer count
on its army.
<p>In Sarand&euml; (300km South of Tirana) about 3000 demonstrators brandishing
sticks poured onto the streets without meeting any resistance. Struck by
the determination of the demonstrators, the police disappeared surreptitiously
from the area. Proletarians pillaged and burnt down the (empty) police
station and the abandoned police cars. The same fate was reserved for the
SHIK buildings. 4000 Kalachnikov rifles fell into the hands of the rebels
who, continuing on their route, attacked the courthouse, the Stock Exchange,
the prison, liberating a hundred or so prisoners. Following this, the insurgent
proletarians set themselves a new objective: to attack the bank, that den
of capital where all their money had been swallowed up, thus abandoning
all their illusions regarding obtaining compensation from the State. The
whole town centre was in flames. The police did not try to intervene at
any point.
<p>In Himaren (a coastal town between Vlor&euml; and Sarand&euml;) rioters
set the Town Hall and the Police Station on fire.
<p>In Delvin&euml;, between Sarand&euml; and Gjirokaster, the rioters burnt
down the police headquarters, the public prosecutor's department and also
pillaged a branch of the savings bank.
<p>In Levan (a village situated between Vlor&euml; and Fieri), a group
of demonstrators broke into a barracks and pillaged an arms depot, without
meeting with any resistance.
<p>In Gjirokaster there had already been an unlimited general strike for
several days. Rioters invaded the police station, helped themselves to
weapons, freed the 15 prisoners inside and then burnt the building down.
The police did not put up any resistance. The next day a commercial complex
belonging to the Gjallica savings society was set on fire.
<p>Road blocks were set up by the rebels on the Vlor&euml;-Sarand&euml;
road and at Tepelen&euml;.
<p>In Tirana, a further demonstration of six thousand people was marked
by violent confrontations in the course of which cameramen from Italy and
Germany were thrashed. The television was recognised for what it is: a
police force serving the State, policing by selective images which impose
on us what we should think about events, policing by pictures, obtaining
photographs of the demonstrators most involved in confrontations for the
cops. The demonstrators went on to attack police cars, turning them over
and setting them on fire. The police force withdrew.
<p>In the face of this situation, the bourgeoisie imposed exceptional measures
and decreed a state of emergency across the whole of Albanian territory
for an indefinite period, until the <i>"reestablishment of constitutional
and public order"</i>. This meant curfew at 8pm, police control with the
right to shoot without warning, prohibition of any gathering of more than
4 people and the right to open fire to disperse crowds, a law for which
the anti-riot or secret police had not waited before firing into crowds
previously!

<p>The members of parliament had adopted this law a few days earlier to
allow a state of emergency to be decreed in the event of an <i>"attempt
to overthrow constitutional order, attacks on arms depots, strategic installations
and public buildings and attacks on economic life and individual liberties"</i>.
Once again, the bourgeoisie showed us how they prepare themselves to ensure
their social order. Once again, we can see that when the proletarian struggle
is powerful and determined, none of these measures can manage to stop it.
<p>In Tirana, Berisha was careful to eliminate any situation in which people
could gather and which could "degenerate": markets, rallies, sporting events...
Hundreds of <i>"potential agitators"</i> were thrown in prison.
<p>On Monday <u>3rd March</u>, despite everything and whilst the south
of the country had taken up weapons against the State, the Parliament renewed
Berisha's presidential term for a further 5 years. Far from realising the
magnitude of the movement, Berisha decided to reestablish order by way
of force, far away from the cameras.
<p>He censored the airwaves and the press. Apart from the official channels,
TV channels, radio broadcasts and newspapers were forbidden. The offices
of Koha Jone, the opposition's most important newspaper, were burned down
with the aid of Molotov cocktails thrown by members of the secret police.
Twenty people were arrested. Only one (pro-governmental) paper, Rijlinda
Demokratika, was allowed and this dedicated all its columns to the reelection
of Sali Berisha as Head of State.
<p>Berisha ordered the military to surround the zone from Vlor&euml; to
Sarand&euml;, but the Albanian army was not trustworthy. Proletarians serving
under a flag were not prepared to turn their arms against proletarians
fighting against the State. In the south of the country desertion and fraternisation
was widespread.
<p>For the government, the first issue was to <i>"liquidate the communist
revolt"</i> and only to discuss it afterwards, as Tritan Shehu, Minister
of Foreign affairs and head of the Democratic Party, declared. In order
to tighten up discipline in the heart of the army, Berisha dismissed the
chief of the staff of the army, accusing him of failing to show enough
zeal to calm the rebellion and failing in the security of military posts,
barracks and arms depots, allowing the rebels to invade them and help themselves
to weapons. He replaced him by a military advisor, a member of the SHIK.
The government also reminded the military that they would face penal sanctions
if they refused to obey orders.
<p>As a direct confrontation between the army and the rebels risked spreading
the movement of desertion and fraternisation in the north of the country,
tanks sent to the south were finally driven, not by soldiers, but by members
of the SHIK. Behind those soldiers charged with aiming the artillery at
the bastions of the insurrectional movement were surveillance units, military
police, the secret service... all designed to prevent the soldiers from
abandoning their posts or from turning their weapons against their officers.
<p>Berisha called for the rebels to give up their weapons and reminded
them that those who refused were exposing themselves to the risk of being
shot at without warning.
<p>The army regained control of the situation as far as Fier, a hundred
kilometers south of Tirana. Berisha decided to isolate the south of the
country by severing all means of communication, be it telephone, satellite,
whatever.
<p>Since the proclamation of the state of emergency, queues had formed
in front of the bakeries in Tirana. Prices rose from 30 to 40%.
<p>In Vlor&euml; the last of the "foreign nationals" and journalists were
evacuated by the helicopters of the Italian army, the anti-riot forces
and the army withdrew and only the plain-clothed men of the secret police
remained. Four people were executed as they attempted to hand back their
weapons, following the demands by the government to do so.

<font face="Comic Sans MS">oOo</font></h2></center>
The polarisation between the two camps reinforced itself but one cannot
say that Vlor&euml; represented the proletarian camp and Tirana the bourgeois
camp. It is clear that the movement was not as strong in Tirana, that it
had not taken on an insurrectional dimension. Tirana was the central seat
of all the State's forces. There was a more powerful control over everything
that moved. But just as in Vlor&euml;, revolution and counter-revolution
confronted each other in Tirana. Whilst all the journalists and government
representatives, the police forces and the army were evacuated from Vlor&euml;,
the whole of the counter-revolution organised around the bourgeois opposition
to the Berisha government remained, crystallised notably in the <i>Committee
for Public Safety</i>.
<p>On Tuesday the <u>4th March</u>, Sali Berisha once again turned down
proposals to broaden the government towards the opposition, in spite of
international pressure to do so. He continued to accuse the Socialist Party
of stirring up <i>"armed rebellion"</i>.
<p>The American government was worried about the turn of events. It understood
that allowing financial swindles to run at full pelt and then confronting
the proletariat with a whip could only lead Albania into dangerous waters.
But it also understood that disembarking with NATO forces in Albania could
provoke an extension of the troubles into what the worldwide bourgeoisie
call the <i>"powder keg of the Balkans"</i>, whose explosion they dread
so much.
<p>From their side, with Berisha's declaration of war, the proletarians
responded by arming themselves!
<p>In Vlor&euml; the arsenals of several barracks were stripped. The rebels
prepared for the army: gunmen took up position on the rooftops of houses,
barricades were set up at the entrance of the city, using the carcasses
of cars, look-outs took up position on the neighbouring hills to watch
the outskirts of the town. One bridge was mined. A few hundred metres beyond
the bridge, tanks appeared. A few minutes later, without engaging in battle,
they turned around and left.
<p>The army had to face fierce resistance in Styari. The military offensive
was repelled in 40 minutes. After this first engagement the army withdrew.
<p>In Sarand&euml; also, far from thinking about handing in their weapons,
the question being asked was: where to get weapons to protect themselves?
The rebels decided to go and look in the naval and police buildings. The
whole city went - children, women, men. The police stations had already
been abandoned and in the Navy there were only a few officers left who
had been sent home by soldiers who had already gone over to the side of
the movement. The insurgents got hold of a battery of artillery, canons
and heavy machine guns with the capacity to control the region within a
radius of 30km, as well as six warships. They brought back large quantities
of arms and bags stuffed with munition from the naval base. Between ten
thousand to fifteen thousand armed men gathered in the town centre to organise
barricades, how to guard them and a defence in case of attack. Groups of
youths armed with Kalashnikov rifles and submachine guns attacked Turkish,
Greek and French journalists and demanded that taped recordings be destroyed.
<p>The army attacked: army units tried to regain the port but armed insurgents
awaited them, firm-footed. Despite tanks being sent in, the naval base
of Sarand&euml; stayed in the hands of the rebels.
<p>In order to prevent any further arrival of army tanks, all routes to
the north were cut. At one roadblock, a member of the secret police was
found in an unmarked police car and was burnt alive, two others managed
to escape and the fourth was taken hostage.
<p>On the road leading to Sarand&euml;, 50 soldiers of the regular army
went over to the side of the insurrection with three tanks.
<p>In Delvin&euml; army divisions shot at the rebels from Mig-15's, resulting
in dozens of deaths. Two pilots who refused to shoot at the population
fled in a Mig-15 and asked for political asylum in Italy. The decomposition
of the army by the struggle was such that even the officers refused to
shoot at "civilians". Berisha thought he could count on a real force, but
he had to realise quickly that, in spite of his reorganisations, the army
was not prepared to confront the insurgents.
<p>Faced with the military triumph of the insurrection, the bourgeoisie
reorganised and strengthened its political response. An <i>Autonomous Local
Council</i> was set up in Sarand&euml;, led by officials in the bourgeois
opposition, as well as a <i>Defence Council</i> directed by a retired colonel.
These Councils formulated conditions for the handing over of weapons: early
elections, sacking President Berisha and the formation of a government
of technocrats to ensure the transition. One of the first measures taken
by these Councils was to organise teams of "self-defence against looters"
and "protectors of property"! These wheeler-dealing politicos were in direct
contact with Berisha and stressed to him that the army surrounding Sarand&euml;
should abstain from intervening because they knew that, if it did, they
would no longer be able to control anything. The entirety of the bourgeois
fractions were looking for the means to liquidate/control the movement.
In this way, the most capable fraction would go on to improve its position
in the balance of forces compared to other fractions. Thus, in the name
of the battle for democracy, the leader of the <i>Defence Council</i> of
the city ordered the rebels to stop wearing masks (corresponding to the
police's need to identify those heading the movement!). Every day started
with a broadcast of the Albanian national anthem.
<p>It is clear that it was not the proletariat that was expressing itself
in these Councils. Handing back weapons in exchange for a new government,
respect for private property, saluting the flag... it was, without doubt,
the bourgeoisie's programme. These Councils represented a further attempt
by the bourgeois opposition parties to regain control of the movement,
reorganise themselves in a far more pernicious manner than that which aimed
its canons on rebel cities.
<p>There was no doubt for the rebel proletarians that the army opposing
them was an enemy to fell (by disarming it, fraternising with soldiers,
demoralising it, pushing for its decomposition...) but they failed to recognise
the bourgeois at their sides, who were also armed and supposedly fighting
against a "common enemy", as being the other face of the same enemy. And
yet the opposition parties were sharpening their knives as much against
the Berisha government as against the proletariat. The bourgeois opposition,
which took up arms against the government, with the aim of directing them
principally against the proletariat, used the fight against chaos and economic
disorganisation to present itself as the only valid alternative, that is
the unique alternative capable of feeding proletarians.
<p>Despite this sabotage, Wednesday <u>5th March</u> marked a further extension
of the insurrection. The insurrectional movement spread to Memaliaj and
Tepelen&euml;, where proletarians took to the streets, burned down the
police station and pillaged shops. Burnt out carcasses were used to build
barricades. The rebels got hold of heavy weapons from the artillery brigade.
Mortars, canons, anti-aircraft batteries, ground-air missiles all passed
into the hands of the rebels who set them up on the hills over the city.
<p>In Gramsh (15km from Gjirokaster) the insurgents captured a small bridge
from the soldiers who were controlling it and dynamited it in order to
prevent tanks from advancing.
<p>In the north, less affected by the movement, the government distributed
five thousand weapons to members of the Democratic Party in order to confront
the rebels. Solid roadblocks were built at the entrance and the exit of
every town, in order to control all movements.
<p>On Thursday <u>6th March</u> and the following days, the uprising reached
more and more towns and villages.
<p>In order to fight against the passivity of the army, Berisha announced
the arrest of 4 officers who were accused of failing to defend their barracks
against pillaging. The government also demanded the extradition of two
Albanian pilots who had fled to Italy abord a MIG-15. They were charged
with desertion.
<p>However Berisha became obliged to realise that there was no point in
continuing to give orders if these were not followed. He would only add
to the ridicule of the armed forces. Defeatism would spread even more widely.
<p>Finally, in an attempt to decrease tension, as much on the side of the
insurgents as on what was left of his army, he suspended military operations
in the South for 48 hours (until 6am on Sunday 9th March) and promised
an amnesty for those giving up weapons stolen from the army... providing
they had not committed any crime! This reserved the State the right to
condemn all those who had taken up arms!
<p>Apart from this, having refused all collaboration with the opposition
up until then, he was obliged, under pressure from European delegations,
a Greek diplomatic mission, warnings from the American government, events...
to accept an initial meeting. This was a true call by the worldwide bourgeoisie
to reestablish national unity against the proletariat! In the face of proletarian
danger, competing bourgeois parties, the Democratic Party and the opposition
parties felt the need to ally their forces and they called for calm jointly.
<p>In reply, the insurgents reinforced their positions. The timescale for
handing over weapons, the promise of amnesty, calls for calm were all rejected
unanimously.
<p>Vlor&euml;, Sarand&euml;, Delvin&euml;, Gjirokaster and Tepelen&euml;
remained in the hands of the rebels. Anticipating further attacks by the
army, the rebels reinforced their defence systems, put up blocks and control
points in order to delay the advance of the armed forces.
<p>In Sarand&euml;, tanks taken from the armed forces were deployed at
the entrance to the town.
<p>The movement spread to Himaren and Samilia...
<p>It is important to stress here that it was the proletariat, by its will,
by its determination to fight whatever the cost, that defeated the army.
It was proletarian combativity which sowed the seeds of defeatism in the
ranks of the army and which brought about the defeat of movements of troops
still faithful to their posts. In the ranks of the proletariat there were
celebrations, euphoria, their determination had paid off, they had achieved
a real victory.
<p>But the proletarians lost everything when they believed the promises
of change. Later they only gave up arms after more than a few threats (instead
of promises), especially now that they know that handing over weapons means
letting the SHIK take charge of repression, which can only be terrible!
<p>At that moment the proletariat was in a position of strength, armed
to the teeth, determined not to be walked over. But this was also the moment
at which the crucial question arose of determining with more clarity which
direction to give to future confrontations.
<p>What to do with this force? What extension and what objectives to give
to the struggle? Against whom to direct all these weapons? Against the
governmental forces alone? What to do with this power it had in its hands?
It was controlling entire towns, the roads leading to them,... food shortages
were beginning, there was a need to organise supplies. On what criteria?
Those of the <i>Autonomous Local Council</i> of Sarand&euml; calling for
the defence of private property? What direction to give all of this?
<p>It seems that the proletariat was not able to answer all of these questions.
The question of which direction to give the struggle was left in the hands
of the bourgeois opposition which, on its part, did not wait for it to
decide before confiscating it from the proletariat. On the contrary, the
counter-revolution profited from this moment of indecision to regain the
upper hand.

Fertile ground to isolate revolution in one region and to impose limits
on the revolutionary action of the proletariat rests always on the belief,
carried from generation to generation, that only the bourgeois order is
capable of bringing about solutions: <i>"we cannot live without money"</i>,
<i>"the
police are necessary"</i>,... <i>"without all of that it would be chaos"</i>.
Internationally, not only was there no other important proletarian struggle,
but the isolation of the proletariat in Albania was reinforced by the systematic
cover-up of everything that was going on. The worldwide bourgeoisie ensured
that across the world the talk was not of proletarian struggle, nor revolution
in Albania, but of chaos, disorder, anarchy.
<p>National and international counter-revolution deployed its <i>Defence
Committees</i>, <i>Public Protection</i>, humanitarian aid... if the revolution
is incapable of giving food, then the counter-revolution will do it. Everywhere
it was a question of substituting the real alternative of proletarian revolution
versus capitalist reorganisation for National Salvation versus generalised
chaos. Thus they achieved submission to <i>"public protection"</i>, to
the <i>"safeguard of the nation"</i>, etc.
<p>The extreme tension that had kept all the armed proletarians alert and
ready for combat gave way to a certain numbness... whilst the others organised
themselves!
<p>The same day in Vlor&euml;, a <i>Committee of Public Protection</i>
(a cartel of all the parties of the bourgeois opposition, presided over
by the local leader of the Forum for Democracy) and a <i>Defence Committee</i>
(formed by ex-officers thrown out of the army during the purges led by
Berisha in recent years) were created. During their first press conference
the CPP representatives lorded it under a big Albanian flag. It was the
same at Sarand&euml;, where they made conditions for the surrender of weapons:
early elections and the formation of a government of technocrats to ensure
the transition, withdrawal of the army from the hills surrounding the city.
The whole programme of the bourgeois opposition was asserted once again.
This is illustrated by the measures that followed. On the <u>10th March</u>,
the CPP launched an appeal for <i>"all honest policemen"</i> to present
themselves in order to help <i>"reestablish calm and peace"</i>. On the
<u>11th
march</u>, in a declaration signed with the Italian embassador to Tirana,
the CPP committed itself to <i>"favorise the immediate handing over of
weapons in the possession of inhabitants"</i> and to <i>"ensure public
order and the progressive return to administrative normality"</i> of the
city.
<p>As in Sarand&euml;, these Committees/Councils were guarantors of the
disarmament of the proletariat, the return to bourgeois order, to peace...
guarantors of capital. They meant to defend the State monopoly on arms,
respect for the private property of the rich and the trading of proletarians'
labour force (walking meat to haggle over).
<p>Peace, for them, signifies disarming the proletariat in order to return
to social peace. Peace which is not peace. For the bourgeois State it is
a question of ensuring its monopoly on arms so that, in the perpetual war
that it wages on the proletariat, the proletariat should be dispossessed
of any response, by unable to arm its anger. Their peace is waging their
war in peace, against an enemy without defence. Proletarians muzzled, feet
and hands tied, this is the programme of our bourgeois.
<p>Even the demand for reimbursement of their savings lost in the pyramid
operations took second place.
<p>This demand did, during the strongest moments of the movement, undergo
the revolutionary transformation from a demand for State intervention into
a practical critique of bourgeois economy: the armed proletariat reappropriating
money stashed away in the banks.
<p>Starting from the same demand, the counter-revolution often operated
according to this outline: to neglect so-called <i>economic</i> demands:
wages, food prices, here the savings,... to move onto what it classes as
a higher level: the so-called <i>political</i> demands which all come back
to demanding the fall of the ruling government in the name of a lack of
democracy. As in Poland where Lech Walesa, still at the head of a committee
of strikers in Gdansk, said: <i>"It is better to have rights than a full
plate"</i>. And the struggle that had started from a proletarian point
of view, against increases in the price of meat, that is against an increase
in the rate of exploitation, was deviated into a struggle for democratic
reforms and finally for a new government (9). In Albania also, the demand
for full reimbursement of the money put in building societies, the loss
of which meant a brutal aggravation of living conditions for most proletarians,
was put to one side in order to emphasise the demand for early elections
and Berisha's resignation.
<p>Through this passage from a so-called <i>economic</i> demand to a so-called
<i>political</i>
demand, the counter-revolution organised the abandonment of the class terrain
to the profit of the terrain of bourgeois reform.
<p>Later, once the change in government has been carried out and in the
face of the fact that the State will not reimburse the proletarians (!),
the rhetoric will put all the responsibility on the old government, accusing
it of having handled things so badly that it is difficult to bring things
back on track, that conditions are difficult, that they need time and,
above all, that everyone must set to it to put the economy back on an even
keel. Which means, for the proletarians, tightening their belts further...
always in the name of a brighter future. And as long as proletarians let
themselves be fooled by these kind of promises, this is how it will be!
<p>On Friday <u>7th March</u>, the insurgents in the south were still refusing
to hand over their weapons. On the contrary, arsenals were still being
pillaged.
<p>The EEC called for President Berisha to defer armed intervention for
as long as possible and to convene early elections. However, despite these
pressures and the first step towards joint organisation of the "surrender
of rebels" with the opposition parties, Berisha still refused to envisage
elections.
<p>At Tepelen&euml; a similar <i>Committee for Public Protection</i> was
set up.
<p>On Saturday <u>8 March</u> in Gjirokaster the insurrection gained ground.
During the 48 hour truce which the government itself had declared, six
government helicopters landed at the town's airport and 65 special service
agents from Tirana got out. A group of insurgents had tried to stop them
landing while men, women and children headed for the barracks to seize
arms. They got hold of impressive reserves of arms and ammunition with
the enthusiastic support of some two thousand soldiers who were happy to
desert and join the ranks of the insurgents. A large quantity of rifles,
revolvers, grenade launchers, bazookas, machine pistols, grenades, ammunition,
mines and seven tanks fell into the hands of the insurgents. The customs
office was also attacked.
<p>On the side of the government forces it was every man for himself. Three
helicopters were taken by the insurgents. The others managed to take off
with only the pilot on board. The troops who had landed, deprived of any
means of retreat, fled for the hills. The insurgents chased them with three
armoured cars. Their flight lasted several days across the mountains to
return to the North, avoiding the barricades, villages and other places
strongly defended by the insurgents. It was a shepherd who told them about
the collapse of the army and the official structures.
<p>Barricades were set up at every crossroad in Gjirokaster. All access
routes to the town were soon blocked. The insurgents took possession of
the local radio. The customs buildings were looted and then burned. The
insurgents also seized a frontier post with Greece. Customs officers, government
employees and police officers rallied to the movement. This allowed the
insurgents to go and get supplies in Greece.
<p>Vlor&euml;, Tepelen&euml;, Himaren, Memaliaj, Delvin&euml;, Sarand&euml;
and Gjirokaster, the most important towns of the South, were now in the
hands of the insurgents. The triumph of the insurrection in Gjirokaster
meant the loss for the government of the most important military and strategic
point in the region. Some journalists commented <i>"It is total anarchy,
there is no longer any police, no longer any State"</i>.
<p><i>"The army will never intervene against the civilians. It doesn't
exist anymore"</i> said a former defence minister, Perikli Teta.
<p>A few hours later in Gjirokaster, towards noon, a <i>Committee of Public
Salvation</i> and a <i>Committee of Defence</i> were formed, presided over
by General Gozhita, who had been kicked out by Berisha 18 months earlier.
They called for the handing over of stolen arms and ordered that <i>"shops
open their doors"</i> while declaring that <i>"those who commit pillage
will be punished"</i>. At the same time they demanded the return of the
soldiers who had fled to the hills... to reestablish order. The lack of
proletarian autonomy was tragic, even the obscure personages who led the
committees complained about it. The basis of the town committees was obviously
the same as those in Sarand&euml; and Vlor&euml;.
<p>On Sunday <u>9 March</u> the town of Perm&euml;t fell into the hands
of the insurrection. The insurgents mobilised against government forces
who had been dispatched to the region the previous day. The confrontations
left five dead and many others wounded on the side of the insurgents. An
entire brigade of soldiers went over to their side. Once the attack was
repulsed the insurgents attacked, looting and destroying the police station,
the court, the town hall, two banks and many shops. Barricades were set
up at the entrances to the town, notably in the direction of Kor&ccedil;a
where the government forces had retreated.
<p>The insurrectional movement seized sixteen other villages in the region
of Perm&euml;t.
<p>In Perm&euml;t as well, a <i>Committee of Public Salvation</i>, a cartel
was constituted, representing all the opposition parties and the Democratic
Party (prefiguring the accord which would follow).
<p>The extension of the insurrectional movement and, above all, the fall
of Gjirokaster (an military base indispensable for any military intervention
by the government) was what convinced Berisha. It was without doubt this
new element, dangerously rocking the balance of forces, which persuaded
the president to agree an accord with the Socialist Party, the main bourgeois
opposition party. The accord foresaw the installation of a government of
"national reconciliation", the planning of new legislative elections between
then and June and the enlargement of the promised amnesty to all those,
civilians or soldiers, who had participated in the insurrectional movement.
The two parties once again launched the appeal to hand in arms and this
time fixed the waiting period at one week.
<p>The <i>Committees of Public Salvation</i> and the <i>Committees of Defence</i>
where all the parties sat, including the local representatives of the Democratic
Party, and where the Socialist Party played a key role, welcomed the accord.
<p>The Socialist Party swore that it would dissolve all the insurgent committees
of the movement within three days...
<p>At Sarand&euml; and Vlor&euml; the insurgents expressed their first
disavowal of the politics of the Councils/Committees of Public Salvation.
At Sarand&euml;, approving the accords with Berisha, the president of the
Council declared: <i>"Now that the president will nominate the government
and a date for the elections has been fixed, arms must be handed over."</i>
For the first time he was not applauded and the crowd dispersed in silence.
On the following days there were daily gatherings in the public square
which once again took on their role as an organ of decision.
<p>At Vlor&euml; the daily demonstration happened this time without a flag,
nor a banner, nor an opposition leader and embarked on looting and burning
shops. A few people suspected of belonging to the secret police were arrested.
A list of people to be eliminated in exchange for a certain price was discovered
on one of them.
<p>The same day, in the North, proletarians began to take arms. They expropriated
one of the biggest arms depots in the North of Albania, at Shkoder. At
Peshkopia, Lezha-Kuksi and Lacy the army fell into disorder, in the face
of the generalisation of the expropriations.
<p>On Monday <u>10 March</u> the Socialist Party's bet that it would have
everything in hand within three days looked seriously compromised, even
more so now that the movement had extended to Skrapari, Malakastra, Kelcyra,
Berat, Poli&ccedil;an, Ku&ccedil;ova, Gramsh.
<p>In Berat the insurgents emptied three savings banks and plundered many
shops, the state food reserves and the arms factories of three barracks.
The garrison and the police abandoned the town without firing a shot and
the insurgents shared out the arms from the police stations and barracks.
A <i>Committee of Public Salvation</i> was set up with the immediate intention
of organising the handing over of arms! It also demanded the sacking of
Berisha. It is obvious that whenever the bourgeoisie succeeded in imposing
this demand it was only making use of the weaknesses of the proletarian
movement and thus preparing its disarmament in exchange for the dismissal
of Berisha and the planning of new elections.
<p>In Gramsh (60 km to the South of Tirana) where there is an important
arms factory, the insurgents seized three barracks and burnt down the police
station. They set out towards Fier, a town situated to the North of the
zone taken by the insurgents. They took control of several routes into
the area and beat back the forces of order who partially lifted their blockade
of the region.
<p>In Skrapari the insurgents emptied the army's armouries, attacked the
military airport of Ku&ccedil;ova and took control of Poli&ccedil;an (between
Skrapari and Berat) where there is an arms and ammunition factory. The
clashes led to fourteen wounded.
<p>Faced with the fact that he could no longer count on the army, Berisha
armed his followers. They plundered some major arms depots in Bajram-Curri
and Kukes, two small towns in the North in an inaccessible mountain area.
<p>On Tuesday <u>11 March</u> the <i>Committees of Public Salvation</i>
of eight southern towns met at Gjirokaster and created a <i>National Front
for the Salvation of the People</i> whose demands were the sacking of Berisha,
a profound reorganisation of the secret police, the return of lost savings
and the organisation of democratic parliamentary elections, thus confirming
their function of trapping the movement in a bourgeois alternative. The
President of the CPS of Sarand&euml; confirmed: <i>"There will be no question
of handing over arms until the installation of democracy is guaranteed."</i>
<p>On the government side, a new Prime Minister, Bashkim Fino, was appointed
to form a government of "national reconciliation". His first action was
to recruit reinforcements for the police and to stop the uprising in Durr&euml;s,
where three proletarians had been murdered.
<p>On that day thirteen towns were in the hands of the insurgents: Poli&ccedil;an,
Kelsyra, Permet, Ku&ccedil;ova, Shrapar, Berat, Gjirokaster, Sarand&euml;,
Delvin&euml;, Himaren, Tepelen&euml;, Menaliaj, Vlor&euml;.
<p>And Kruma, Burrel and La&ccedil;i, little towns in the North, can be
added to the list.
<p>On Wednesday <u>12 March</u> the situation was tense. Against all expectations,
the government of "national reconciliation" did not have the desired impact
on the movement. On the contrary, the measures which it took to reorganise
the police hardened the position of the insurgents, whose movement continued
to make gains in the North.
<p>At Elbasan, the last stop before Tirana (coming from the South), the
tension was extreme. While the army and the secret police withdrew to 50
km to the Southeast and 70 km to the Southwest of the capital, the insurgents
reinforced their positions and seized the armouries left by the army. The
arms, ammunition and explosives factory at Mjeksi (to the South of Elbasan)
was also pillaged.
<p>After Elbasan, the army also disappeared from Fier, Cerrick (after fighting
with the secret police) and Gramsh where the insurgents had burned the
police station and plundered three barracks.
<p>Shkoder, the most important northern town, was in turn taken by the
uprising. The besieged barracks were abandoned by the soldiers. The insurgents
also attacked the prisons, there they smashed down the doors and freed
the detainees. A bank branch was dynamited, the court was sacked. Business
premises were ripped open and surgically emptied. After having been ransacked
and blazed, the town hall was now occupied by a few families. Barricades
were made of half-burnt rubbish and car carcasses on a carpet of broken
glass.
<p>The important air base of Gjader, near Lehze, 80 km North of Tirana,
also fell into the hands of the insurgents.
<p>It therefore rested with the international bourgeoisie to prevent the
propagation of the movement beyond the frontiers at any cost.
<p>Faced with the danger of the extension of the movement in the North
of the country which borders the Kosovo province of Serbia, where the majority
of proletarians are of Albanian origin (10), the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia
(Serbia and Montenegro) closed its two main frontier posts with Albania.
<p>The governments of the USA, France and Italy called on their citizens
to leave Albania. Moscow and Belgrade began to evacuate their diplomatic
personnel and their families.
<p>Military units, including a tank regiment, positioned themselves along
the Shkumbin river. But in Sauk in front of the barracks in the suburbs
of Tirana an officer instructor, wearing the insignia of the armoured division
on his collar, declared that the army would not react in the case of an
insurrection. <i>"We cannot fire on our people."</i> This sentiment was
shared by almost the whole of the institution. Both the soldiers and the
officers expressed this sentiment on different occasions.
<p>Berisha's Democratic Party continued to arm its supporters around Tirana,
notably in Kavaja, from then on the only town under government control
south of the capital. From the North of Albania and Kosovo lorries brought
well paid mercenaries. Berisha's supporters also looted arsenals in the
towns of the North.
<p>In Tirana members of the secret police entered the military academy
and three other arms depots in the area, including at the airport, and
cleaned them out. Seven depots of the anti-aircraft defence brigade were
emptied, one of which contained 10,000 light arms. The SHIK distributed
assault rifles to its henchmen and to the loyal supporters of the Democratic
Party.
<p>The bourgeoisie made some panicky comments: <i>"A president who has
lost all authority, a government of 'national reconciliation' which has
no more of a grip on events, an army which turns and runs when the first
shot is fired... never in recent history has a country on the old continent
known the disintegration in such rapid succession of all its institutions,
of all the instruments charged with making people respect public order.
It is a question of a real collapse of the State."</i>
<p>The Albanian writer Isma&iuml;l Kadare (who has lived in Paris since
1990) called for the intervention of a buffer force in Albania. <i>"A international
arbiter is needed when a whole country is heading for a precipice. It's
not important what the forms and procedures are, anything is good if it
prevents a tragedy on such a scale."</i>
<p>Following this, all the bourgeois parties of Albania launched a joint
appeal in favour of an armed intervention of the European powers <i>"so
as to restore constitutional order"</i>. The decomposition of the state
was such that the bourgeoisie became more and more favourable to the intervention
of other international authorities so as to reestablish order.
<p>On the <u>13 March</u> the secret police was all over Tirana, having
withdrawn from the regions in the South, where it had been the only force
fighting the insurgents.
<p>A convoy of armoured cars and Mercedes wound its way around the central
Skanderbeg square. The SHIK men let off volleys of automatic rifle fire
and shouted very loudly to show that they were again the masters of the
nerve centre of Tirana. Armoured cars were deployed on Martyrs' Boulevard
and Nation Boulevard where the presidential palace, parliament and other
government buildings are situated.
<p>Most of the ministries and administrations were shut, as well as banks
and businesses. The streets were deserted. The firing of automatic weapons
was incessant. Six people, including two children, were killed, mostly
victims of stray bullets or accidental explosions of mines or grenades.
The screws abandoned the prisons, letting some six hundred prisoners escape.
<p>Despite the omnipresence of the SHIK, Tirana did not escape the frenzy
of pillaging. Masses of demonstrators from the poor neighbourhoods expropriated
the food depots, among others a huge flour warehouse in the suburb of Lapraka.
Other demonstrators plundered and expropriated the Police School, and in
the residential district of Tirana, where there are several embassies,
they succeeded in appropriating Kalashnikovs and canisters of butane. The
sentries at the National Guard Headquarters (which was only 300m from these
targets) didn't lift a finger in the face of this action. The barracks
were pillaged as much for arms as for the supplies they were stocked with,
furniture, bathroom fittings, heaters... There was nothing left of the
barracks but a boneless carcass.
<p>In the centre of Tirana the favourite targets of the proletarians were
public buildings and the enterprises where work was so detestable and badly
paid. Workshops, buildings... nothing was left. Even the roof beams and
steel rods from the frames were taken. There was no more furniture or machinery,
no more tiles or cornices, no more door frames, no light fittings. All
the electric wiring and switches had been torn out, just like the wash
basins and heaters, down to the smallest bit of piping. There was no more
glass or sills, just holes where the windows used to be.
<p>From now on almost every person had at least one gun, a Kalashnikov
or some other type.
<p><i>"There is no army,"</i> a journalist commented, <i>"the soldiers
are abandoning the barracks and going home. The police, many of whom have
exchanged their uniforms for plain clothes, are limited for the moment
to looking after the prisons and official buildings. But this hasn't prevented
a massive flight: in three penitentiaries the prisoners have succeeded
in escaping and more than a thousand prisoners are now enjoying unexpected
freedom..."</i>
<p>The chief administrator of Tirana launched a televised appeal for calm
in the name of all the political parties. But at the end of the afternoon
Tirana seemed to be on the brink of revolt.
<p>The loyal employees in the ministries stuffed computers and files into
their vehicles, recognisable from the yellow government number plates.
Soldiers and policemen deserted their posts and went home. Even the big
shots of the SHIK disappeared from the scene.
<p>The bourgeoisie abandoned Tirana.
<p>The embassies circulated a general evacuation order. A company of Marines
was deployed in front of the American embassy. An air bridge was established
between Italian navy units patrolling the Gulf of Tarente and the port
of Durr&euml;s. Three Super-Pumas from the French airforce and two Cougars
from the army, six helicopters from the German army sent from the NATO
Stabilisation Force (S-FOR) in Bosnia, Cobra helicopters from the US army...
and fifteen Albanian naval ships and even others from the Greek fleet were
pressed into service to evacuate their respective "foreign nationals",
protected by units of paratroopers and marines. On many occasions the operations
were interrupted by rifle fire, anti-aircraft cannon and portable ground
to air missiles.
<p>On the evening of Wednesday 13 March, the historic town of Kor&ccedil;a
(in the southeast of the country) was looted. Proletarians went to the
barracks of Poceste where they took arms and four armoured cars.
<p>At Lezha proletarians attacked the office of the secret police (whose
members had disappeared) and the State Bank where they dynamited the safe.
<p>The worthies of the town immediately created a Committee of Safety of
Lezha to try to calm down the movement. They went through the town by car
making appeals for calm through a megaphone. They were drowned out by fusillades
of bullets.
<p><i>"The army has collapsed, the state has faltered"</i>... said a journalist
before leaving Tirana.

<font face="Comic Sans MS">oOo</font></h2></center>
That moment marked the high point of the movement. From the South to the
North, the insurrectional movement generalised itself, shaking even that
bastion of the state, the capital. But if the forces of the bourgeoisie
withdrew from Tirana it was so as to reorganise themselves better on a
national and international level. While on the side of the proletariat
they again tasted the cruel lack of perspective and of a classist direction
in the midst of isolation and international incomprehension.
<p>In effect, if the struggle in Albania marked, like the struggle in Iraq
(11), a moment of rupture with the international situation of social peace,
it is precisely this context of international non-struggle which prevented
the movement from going further. International social peace weighs heavily
on the extraordinary movement of the proletariat in Albania, just like
it previously weighed on the proletarian insurrection in Iraq. The proletariat
in Albania needs to extend the struggle internationally but it finds neither
the support nor the necessary comprehension from the rest of the world
proletariat who, stupefied by the international campaign of the bourgeoisie,
don't recognise themselves in the struggle of their class brothers and
sisters in Albania and imagine even less the real force of the ruptures
which have taken place.
<p>This lack of international support calls for an even clearer affirmation
of revolutionary perspectives in Albania than the proletariat has set out.
But if in the course of the confrontations the proletariat has recognised
the whole of its enemies, it is more difficult for them to affirm now the
levels of organisation capable of thwarting the successive changes of political
spare parts which allow the bourgeoisie to regain control of the situation.
<p>When the proletariat makes an attack on the whole of the structures
of the bourgeois state and defeats the army... when to private property
it opposes collective appropriation, pillaging banks, warehouses, shops...
when to a Justice which consecrates the omnipotence of the bourgeoisie,
isolates the proletariat and leads it, riddled with rights, right to prison,
it opposes collective class force, burning police stations and courts and
opening the prisons... when to the peaceful protests organised by the opposition,
it responds by the generalised taking up of arms... <u>it affirms practically
the spontaneously revolutionary nature of its struggle</u>.
<p>But to give force and continuity to these confrontations it is vital
for the proletariat to build up <u>qualitatively superior levels of organisation</u>
capable of pushing things in a clearer direction and thus assuming a well-defined
break with the bourgeois alternatives. Not doing this means surrendering
the ground which has been gained. Unhappily, we have to state that the
proletariat in Albania does not appear to have produced regroupments, associations,
organs or whatever, which are true to its nature, which call for class
actions, which express, by their very existence, the necessity of organising
outside and against the bourgeois state, which clearly call for the destruction
of the state, the international generalisation of struggle, the affirmation
of the communist movement (12). In the course of the revolutionary process,
the point always comes where a qualitative jump is indispensable in direction,
in internationalism. If the proletariat does not provide one, the bourgeoisie
will just use the circumstances to reorganise itself.
<p>Thus, once the anger had exploded, the army had been defeated, the bourgeoisie
of Tirana had fallen prey to panic, the question was posed of <i>what to
do</i> with this position of strength acquired in the course of the confrontations.
What was at stake at that moment was the need for a much clearer definition
and delimitation of our enemies. Without this, the opposition movements
which the bourgeoisie had created to give a political direction to the
conflict &shy; oppositionists who had habitually marched next to the proletariat
in confrontations with the state &shy; succeeded in confining it to a simple
opposition to the government of Berisha.
<p>When the proletariat made a critique of the electoral point of view
by taking over the streets and attacking all the structures of the state,
when the proletariat shouted <i>"Down with Berisha!"</i>, a slogan which
in a limited and confused way said <i>"Down with the state!"</i>, the opposition
transformed everything into a demand for the anticipated elections, a solution
advocated by the world bourgeoisie to negate the initial critique made
by our class.
<p>The sort of qualitative jump which would exclude the democratic trap
would have consisted of translating into slogans or, to put it another
way, inscribing on the banners of the movement, <u>the strict reality of
what was happening in the streets!</u> <i>"Down with Berisha!"</i> would
then have been replaced by slogans reflecting the real movement: <i>"Down
with the state, its cops and its politicians in the government and in the
opposition!"</i>, <i>"Down with parliament!"</i>, <i>"Down with elections!"</i>,
<i>"Long
live the generalised arming of the proletariat!"</i> Of course, it isn't
just a question of words. It's a matter of making conscious <u>what is
going on in reality</u>, of consciously taking on the revolutionary direction
that the struggle of the proletariat naturally takes (13) of clearly brandishing
the flag of communism. Throughout the history of our class, even in the
strongest moments of the struggle, it happens that what the proletariat
says about its own struggle remains behind its real practice. Thus in Albania,
the unifying flag of the movement remained an extremely poor one which
never really went beyond the conservative slogan
<i>"Down with Berisha!"</i>,
a slogan which gave the Socialist opposition all the arms it needed to
recuperate the movement.
<p>Sticking to the slogan <i>"Down with Berisha!"</i> meant accepting (as
the opposition avidly hoped) that once Berisha was discarded there would
be no more reason to struggle. In fact, the sacking of Berisha did become
the condition for handing over arms.
<p>As is often the case in any movement of struggle, it happened once again
that it is not combativity which is lacking but <u>the clear definition
of class objectives</u>. Here, again, it is not arms or courage which proletarians
lack (as is generally believed by militarists and guerrilla-ists of all
kinds) but a clear definition of what to turn their arms against.
<p>It is that which was the limit of the break which proletarians made
with the counter-revolution. At that high point, while the proletariat
didn't do anything to take the movement forward, the international bourgeoisie
beat out a call to organise support for the Albanian state in its struggle
against the insurrection. On one side was the unified world bourgeoisie,
and on the other was the proletariat in Albania &shy; isolated. The bourgeoisie
possesses a very long experience of how to defeat the proletariat country
by country. And what is most tragic is that it will continue to be this
way as long as the proletariat does not organise itself as an international
force and does not give itself a revolutionary centralisation/direction.
<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">The Restructuring of Bourgeois Order in Albania</font></u></h2>
On Friday <u>14 March</u> the European Union assured Albania of its support
in the form of humanitarian aid. A member of the Defence Commission of
the Parliamentary Assembly of the Western European Union (in a word: a
bourgeois) declared:
<p><i>"We have all the military capacity needed to calm things down and
take control of this matter. On condition that we hit hard and fast."</i>
<p><i>"The Eurocorps comprises 50,000 fully operational men. A force of
some 10,000 soldiers, hardly a fifth of the effective number, heavily equipped
and armoured, would be sufficient to take the situation in hand."</i>
<p><i>"And to contain the insurgents and make them hand over their Kalashnikovs?
The means of pressure that we have are largely sufficient. For example,
establishing a sort of exchange: the handover of stolen arms against the
provision of food."</i>
<p>Here we have a good description of what the bourgeoisie intend to do
by means of humanitarian aid: the disarmament of the proletariat by military
intimidation and the threat of starvation!
<p>On <u>15 March</u> Berisha launched an appeal to volunteers wanting
to maintain order in the capital to join the Albanian army or police in
return for a salary of four hundred dollars a month, which is equivalent
to four times the average salary. The government also promised to triple
the wages of police officers who returned to their posts. More than a thousand
former officers presented themselves at the Ministry of Defence so as to
patch up the army whereas thousands of young people joined the ranks of
the police &shy; without any need to show their papers when enroling! Rifles
and ammunition were distributed to them.
<p>On <u>16 March</u> the Albanian state received the support of its Italian
and Greek brothers who were ready to send experts to advise the Albanian
police and army and to help them reestablish order.
<p>On <u>17 and 18 March</u> some experts from the EU came to Tirana to
talk to the Albanian government with the aim of evaluating the importance
and scope of a humanitarian aid mission.
<p>While these gentlemen discussed how to <i>"normalise the situation in
Albania"</i>, what was happening in the streets changed its character little
by little. Whereas before it came alive, full of proletarians discussing
the next action, whereas before it was a place for all the assaults, looting,
burning, barricades step by step the street was given up to confrontations
of a completely different nature.
<p>To explain this, we are going to take a little detour.
<p>The capitalist mode of production places each unit of production in
opposition to the others and thus generates a perpetual war of all against
all. The opening of Albania's borders cruelly laid bare these contradictions
and made them explode. This was not in the sense that these contradictions
were a novelty for Albania - the laws of capitalism have <u>always</u>
reigned there! - but because the attempt to run the Albanian economy in
a protectionist way imposed until then a certain discipline on the bourgeoisie,
a discipline made possible by relatively low real wages (compared to other
countries). But this only postponed the bursting forth of all these contradictions,
and it was precisely this postponement (a practice inherent in any kind
of populist and protectionist capitalism) which aggravated the explosion
when it became inevitable. It is also for that reason that the permanent
war which the bourgeoisie dedicate themselves to was conducted in such
a chaotic manner when everything exploded.
<p>When Albania opened its frontiers a mob of young and ruthless capitalists
piled in and took over whole sectors, attracted by the low level of wages
and avid to enrich themselves rapidly on what they thought was an innocent,
naive and domesticated proletariat. But this only exacerbated the competitive
struggle for a quick profit and before long the situation transformed itself
into a war of plunder concretely expressed by innumerable armed confrontations
within the bourgeoisie, ending up as a chaotic struggle between enterprises
and rival mafias (just like in other countries such as the ex-USSR).
<p>In this framework the Berisha government itself seems to have obeyed
its private interests, concentrated around the Democratic Party, rather
than the more global interests of the bourgeoisie in its entirety. As a
general rule, the sectors of the bourgeoisie which control the central
apparatus of the state are assured of that hegemony precisely because they
have proved their capacity to put their private interests to one side for
the profit of the general interests of their class. It seems that here
Berisha, notably through the pyramid companies, was rather more occupied
with his personal fortune than with the interests of the bourgeoisie in
general and the cohesion of the state. It is that which also explains without
doubt why bourgeois fractions could be found behind the slogan <i>"Down
with Berisha!"</i>.
<p>In the month of March 1997, in the midst of the insurrectional movement
of the proletariat, and taking part in the destabilisation of the state,
various fractions of the bourgeoisie benefited from the passage to military
action and settled some accounts. Apart from the followers of Berisha who
took advantage of the situation of general illegality to pillage the barracks
so as to arm themselves, others profited from this same situation to arm
themselves and militarily protect their factories, shops and other businesses.
Thus a good many bosses (14) who yesterday had come to Albania because
the workforce there was available at a good price and because the laws
allowed them to run their affairs a little more to their liking, without
caring about taxes or social protection laws, today found themselves no
longer able to count on the police to protect their private property. These
big bosses and owners therefore surrounded themselves with private militias,
surveillance squads, vigilance committees, "armed bands" to save their
business activity from generalised looting - a task which these militias
had never been able to practically assume elsewhere in the course of the
movement.
<p>Groups of armed proletarians were more and more caught between the armed
bosses' militias, the <i>Councils of Public Salvation</i>, <i>Committees
of Safety</i>, <i>Committees of Defence</i>... which also armed themselves
to reestablish order.
<p>With the aim of delivering a <i>coup de gr&acirc;ce</i> and adding to
the general confusion which would succeed in disarming the proletariat,
the media put into the same bag the actions of the armed proletariat and
the actions of the militias defending private property. "Armed bands" (15)
became the name used to amalgamate actions of a completely different nature
solely on the basis that they were armed.
<p>Looting, for example, can have a completely different class nature depending
on who does it and what the content of their action is. When proletarians
loot goods or arms depots, it is our class which is criticising private
property, the state and the whole of the capitalist social relation. This
expropriation expresses the interests of humanity. It is a matter of collective
appropriation, of a reappropriation of what proletarians have produced
but of which they are always deprived. It is the proletariat which is feeding
and arming its struggle against the state and the reign of commodities.
<p>When other apparently similar looting of arms and goods depots is carried
out, whether by merchants who are organising a traffic in foodstuffs which
have become scarce by selling them to proletarians at outrageous prices...
whether they are militias engaged in protecting capitalist enterprises...
whether they are the lackeys of Berisha... it is clear that the criteria
are not the same. It is not the interests of humanity which are being expressed
here, but rather those of profit, those of the age-old tyranny of the rate
of profit against the human being. It is a matter of private appropriation,
for the private interests of groups of bourgeois who struggle to impose
their fractional interests and who aim to improve their position in the
war of competition between capitals. It is the perpetuation in arms of
the capitalist system.
<p>Another example is the attacks on police stations, which can also take
on completely different natures. When merchants attack police stations
because the police try to take control of their commerce, or demand a percentage,
they are leading an inter-bourgeois war for control of the market. This
attack is completely integrated into the reproduction of the capitalist
system. On the other hand, when the proletariat attack a police station,
liquidate its occupants and burn the buildings of repression, they are
attacking their mortal enemy, which represses them directly and which keeps
them deprived of all property, the capitalist state. Their action is an
integral part of the process of destroying the bourgeois State.
<p>The "armed bands" who plunder goods depots and barracks and attack police
stations so as to carry on their own war of competition constitute the
armed wing of the counter-revolution, that which restores terror against
the proletariat.
<p>Thus, a road block installed in Vlor&euml; extorted money from all the
car drivers who passed by. If they didn't obey they were simply riddled
with bullets.
<p>Again, while the proletariat in arms have organised road blocks to stop
the advance of troops, to arrest members of the secret police, to defend
their struggle, including to obtain funds for this, those who extort money
from car drivers &shy; an a-classist category &shy; have nothing in common
with this struggle and put themselves completely on the side of the State,
which carries out this kind of intimidation every day. The newspapers referred
to the extorters as "bandits", "rebels", "Mafiosi", "scum"... the same
title they gave to any proletarian who takes up arms against the state.
It is clear that here we are talking about a private militia in the service
of capitalist order. This armed band (a boss and his lackeys) which rampaged
around Vlor&euml; in competition with the <i>Committee of Defence</i>,
called like everyone else for the sacking of Berisha (but with the aim
of doing some good illegal business), and little by little took over the
control of defence groups and the circulation of arms. They coldly assassinated
those who did not obey their orders. To defend their private mercantile
interests this armed band imposed the usual bourgeois terror and, in that
way, defended private capitalist interests in general. A journalist's description:
<i>"Criminal
organisations have taken advantage of the situation of disorder in Albania
to do some business, notably in the traffic of drugs and arms. Italian
businessmen have continuous business relations with their Albanian colleagues."</i>
<p>And, to complete the description of the eminently counter-revolutionary
role of this "armed band", here is a proclamation by its leader on the
arrival of the Italian troops: <i>"The Italian soldiers are our brothers...
If anyone touches a hair on their heads they must do it over my dead body."</i>
<p>Other examples:
<ul>
<li>
On the Greek border an "armed band" took control of a crossing point and
extorted from proletarians who were going to stock up with supplies in
Greece.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
In Tirana, a bus was machine gunned to force it to stop so that the assailants
could rob the passengers.</li>
</ul>
But there were also proletarian responses against these armed bands which
aimed to rob proletarians.
<p>On <u>27 March</u>, for example, there was a class response to a band
who came to extort from a village. Strongly armed from looting an important
barracks, the inhabitants refused the racketeers, defended themselves and
avenged their eighteen dead.
<p>Traffickers in "meat on the hoof" also hoped to do some good business
from the new wave of emigration. Thus more than ten thousand refugees clandestinely
arrived on the Italian coasts (a smaller number than in 1991 when it had
been more than forty thousand). They were rapidly repatriated to Albania
(16). Diplomats, ambassadors and company managers were not considered to
be "foreign nationals" &shy; ships, helicopters and planes were chartered
for their evacuation. On the contrary, here we are talking about simple
proles who fled to Italy either because they were attracted by the myth
of the Western paradise or because they wanted to escape repression. They
paid between 500 and 1000 dollars for a place on an old tub that might
not even get there (17). At Durr&euml;s those who ran this commerce in
meat on the hoof knew how to be efficient! A fleet of more than a hundred
speed boats allowed them to control the whole coast and organise their
commerce, particularly with Italy and Greece. On the coast they touted
for business and gathered their candidates, carefully avoiding telling
them what was waiting for them in Italy! At sea they threatened fishermen
and captains of boats so as to keep control of the traffic. The police
were complicit and did not stop them from giving themselves over to their
smuggling.
<p>On the basis of these examples we can understand the ease with which
the bourgeoisie have amalgamated proletarian actions with those of armed
bands of unscrupulous merchants without any criteria apart from those of
the bourgeoisie: profit and the war of all against all. It is the bourgeois
themselves who call proletarians in arms mafia, gangsters, savages, rapists...
cannibals! We can also understand why proletarians felt more and more trapped
between these "armed bands", one lot, responding strictly to their private
interests, going around with the immediate aim of grabbing as much cash
as possible, and the others (the <i>Committees of Defence</i>, <i>Safety</i>
or <i>Public Salvation</i>) whose aims corresponded more to the general
interests of the world bourgeoisie: the reestablishment of the social peace
in an area where proletarian anger had been expressed the most strongly.
<p>Such are the bases on which the confrontations at the beginning of the
movement progressively gave way to confrontations of a completely different
nature. We will now return to the unfolding of actual events.
<p>On Monday <u>19 March</u>, representatives of the government and of
international organisations discussed the objectives of the intervention
and how to dispatch the humanitarian aid. The North American state was
opposed to a military intervention by NATO (18), the German state defined
the conflict as <i>"an internal affair"</i>. The experts agreed in rejecting
direct military intervention to reestablish order in Albania (they were
aware of the danger of generalisation) and considered it more effective
to help the army and the police, so that these institutions could reestablish
the authority of the state, and to assure the protection of airports, embassies
and the main official buildings. In other words the bourgeoisie knew that
they must not make the mistake of carrying out an overt repression, as
Berisha had done, because this had only had the effect of galvanising the
combativity of proletarians in struggle. The bourgeoisie knew that to reestablish
social peace the stick was not enough, the carrot was also vital. It would
be much more effective to present their intervention as humanitarian aid.
They knew that it had to be presented as something which fed proletarians
and therefore constituted the only solution to the problem of survival.
It only remained to decide on the means. Meanwhile, the government of Bashkim
Fino, supported by the EU, was invited to take urgent measures of <i>"social
and humanitarian assistance"</i> to pacify the country. The forces of the
world bourgeoisie then arranged an intervention where the unified foreign
presence would support the local repressive forces and use humanitarian
action as a shopfront.
<p>On <u>20 March</u> the Italian army carried out its first operation
on Albanian soil. Marine infantry from an &eacute;lite unit landed on a
beach close to the port of Durr&euml;s.
<p>On <u>25 March</u> 40 tonnes of French aid in the form of food and medicines
arrived at Tirana airport.
<p>On <u>26 March</u> the negotiations of the Organisation for Security
and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) finally led to the creation of a <i>"humanitarian
mission protected by a multinational force under the UN mandate". "It will
be an escort mission, a humanitarian mission, not a mission for maintaining
order." "The OSCE plan will attempt to create the political conditions
appropriate for holding general elections this summer. But the policing
mission will be essential to assure close protection for the aid convoys
of food and medicines for which the municipalities and the sacked and looted
hospitals have a pressing need."</i>
<p>It was clearly a question of a mission to maintain order but the OSCE
did everything to appear as saviours and not as aggressors. The great fear
of the bourgeoisie remained the danger of internationalisation of the conflict.
At any price the OSCE had to stop the always armed proletariat from continuing
its struggle, not only against the Albanian army but against all the armies
of Europe. This extension of the struggle would have led to the recognition
of the class enemy in a much larger collection of bourgeois fractions,
including those that support the OSCE plan: the <i>Committees of Defence</i>,
<i>of
Safety</i> or <i>of Public Salvation</i>, the Bashkim Fino government,
the whole of the Albanian and international bourgeoisie.
<p>Despite the necessities of world capital and despite the accords concluded
around the strategies to use in Albania, no top officials were prepared
to send soldiers to the South of Albania where the situation remained explosive.
One combatant affirmed: <i>"I am warning the Italian soldiers. I advise
them not to come to Vlor&euml;. If they do we will kill them"</i>. In Spain,
<i>El
Pa&iacute;s</i> carried the headline <i>"Fear in the South"</i> and stressed
that <i>"the lack of availability of forces to deploy in the South of Albania
manifested by the dozen countries who sent the representatives of their
respective high commands to the meeting called in Rome yesterday constitutes
the main obstacle to getting the International Protection Force underway."</i>
The newspaper added: <i>"none of the eight countries, amongst those participants
in this meeting prepared to cooperate in the military part of the plan,
seemed willing to send soldiers into that zone."</i>
<p>More globally the bourgeoisie were afraid that their true objectives
would come to light. In this sense they insisted: <i>"The multinational
military force will stick to its humanitarian mandate and refuse to interfere
in internal policing matters which could very quickly expose it to terrorist
attacks."</i>
<p>On that day of <u>12 April</u>, a contingent of 6,000 soldiers had to
be landed in Albania. The primary objective of the mission was to secure
the ports of Durr&euml;s and Vlor&euml;, Tirana airport and the principal
communication routes between the North and the South of Albania.
<p>On <u>9 April</u> a boat containing a hundred members of the SHIK arrived
at Brindisi to closely control the movement of Albanian refugees. Prospective
migrants were ejected severely from Italy, but it wasn't the same for all
those who collaborated in safeguarding the State. Whether they were "foreign
nationals" or members of the secret police, they received a good welcome
in Italy. Faced with a proletarian threat the bourgeoisie knew to put its
war of competition to one side so as to better wage its war against the
proletariat. The financiers of the bankrupt pyramid savings companies had,
as elsewhere, loyal colleagues in Italy. For example, a chain of supermarkets
in Pouilles belonged to the, up until then, celebrated Vefa.
<p>On <u>12 April</u> the Jaubert commando came to Durr&euml;s to secure
the landing area for the troops of the French Army.
<p>On Monday <u>14 April</u>, an air bridge between Pisa and Tirana was
put in place so as to send material and equipment there. Several C-130s
from the Italian Army had already landed in Tirana.
<p>The <u>15 April</u> marked the beginning of Operation Alba. The 6000
soldiers of the multinational force arrived at the ports of Durr&euml;s
and Vlor&euml;. A cargo sent by the World Food Programme unloaded 360 tonnes
of flour and 36 tonnes of vegetables.
<p>The more frightened the bourgeoisie was to see the extent to which the
proletariat was armed, the more impressive the arrival of the multinational
forces. The size of the boats, the tanks and other vehicles, the sophisticated
armaments... were plenty to intimidate! The voices of proletarians which
were raised against this intimidation were few, which again shows the isolation
of the extraordinary struggle of the proletariat in Albania - an isolation
which the world bourgeoisie succeeded in imposing. On the spot, faced with
this impressive military invasion, only a few insults could be heard: humanitarianism
dictatorially imposed its terror.
<p>In Tirana the situation returned to normal. Newspapers came out as usual,
the shops were stocked, traffic was heavy. The only arms visible were those
of some cops leaning on their armoured car.
<p>On <u>17 April</u>, a delegation from the OSCE met the representatives
of the <i>Committee of Public Salvation</i> in Vlor&euml;. The president
of the Committee confirmed his counter-revolutionary role when he said:
<i>"Operation
Alba may degenerate if it is given the mission of forcibly entering our
homes to take our arms"</i>, reflecting 100% the preoccupations of the
emissaries of the OSCE. We can see here that the fears of the bourgeoisie
in Albania are exactly the same as those of the international humanitarians.
<p>From <u>the first to the seventh of May</u>, the police reappeared on
the streets of Shkoder, Berat, Burrel, Kukes, Kruje. But the institutions
of Justice were not operational. Police stations, prisons, courts... weren't
there any more. Before leaving the buildings the escaping prisoners had
made sure to burn their files and then burn the buildings themselves...
A few days before you could read in the press: <i>"The chief of prison
administration in Albania announced yesterday that the country had no more
than 27 prisoners in gaol against the 1,300 who were there before the massive
flight of convicts on 13 March. Of these 27 prisoners, 9 had returned to
the cells of their own free will."</i>
<p>An astonished magistrate said: <i>"After an interlude of 45 years we
have taken care to make good laws. We have a constitutional charter defining
human rights. There is a Minister of Justice, private associations of magistrates,
the right of appeal, a new criminal code... But we have neglected to educate
the people in this new spirit. What are the insurgents doing with it?"</i>
asks this devoted magistrate who would like us to believe that there has
been no system of repression in Albania since the death of Enver Hoxha.
As if good laws and a good functioning of the judiciary change the nature
of State terrorism. <i>"Instead of taking legal action, they have taken
the direct route: plundering the banks. They have no confidence in the
State and its laws. Even the factory owner in Shkoder: the law had made
him special offers of protection of his business but he preferred to take
on his own vigilantes."</i>
<p>On <u>14 May</u>, the opposition parties threatened to boycott the elections
scheduled for the 29 June 1997. They were calling into question the electoral
law which foresaw a mode of scrutiny based on majoritarianism. The polarisation
of attention around this polemic was an attempt to install more and more
strongly the idea that the solution to all the issues raised in the movement
was to go and vote to sanction the policies of Berisha. Despite having
spontaneously taken on the State and all its structures: its banks, its
police stations, its courts, its prisons, its barracks, its storage depots...
proletarians allowed this totalising struggle to be confiscated in return
for finally just demanding the head of Berisha, and that by means of a
democratic vote.
<p>If, at the beginning, the demand for the head of Berisha could still
signify <i>Down With the State!</i>, now, with the recuperation carried
out by the Socialist opposition, the call for his sacking was just the
political solution approved by the whole of the world bourgeoisie as a
means of disarming proletarians and taking up negotiations along paths
which would ensure them regaining the monopoly of arms.
<p>On <u>21 May</u>, the general accord agreed between the ten parties
foresaw in particular the nomination of a new chief of the secret police.
This partially realised one of the demands of the <i>Committees of Public
Salvation</i> who had called for a profound reorganisation of the secret
police.
<p>On <u>4 June</u>, the president Sali Berisha escaped an attempt on his
life during an electoral meeting of the Democratic Party, three weeks before
legislative elections, planned for the <u>29th June</u>. This event illustrates
the tension which still existed in the country despite the electoral promises.
<p>Apart from rare exceptions, nobody handed over arms stolen during the
looting of the barracks. The state of emergency and the cease-fire remained
vigorously in force.
<p>On <u>27 June</u>, a convoy of international observers set out from
Tirana escorted by Italian and Romanian soldiers. They went towards the
Southwest as far as Gjirokaster, passing through Memaliaj and Tepelen&euml;
&shy; areas which, in March, had been completely in the grip of the insurrectional
movement marked by the looting of barracks and the generalised arming of
the proletariat. Proletarians saluted the vehicles with a few insults but
the convoy went through without any problems. This example shows the general
state of the struggle at that moment: decomposition of the force of the
insurrection, hatred of the new proposals for installing order but the
predominance of powerlessness... resignation had made its appearance once
again.
<p>Two days from the anticipated legislative elections scheduled for <u>29
June</u>, the observers decided that the conditions for a free and democratic
scrutiny had not been achieved. But on 29 June, the bourgeoisie were finally
able to salute Albania's effective "salutary passage to the polling booth"
which, in Bucharest as in Sofia, had allowed that sudden "metamorphosis"
from the danger of revolution to a citizenry obediently queuing for the
democratic carve up. What can the isolation of the polling booth (19) create,
other than isolation? The spectre of revolution was provisionally banished
from Albania with the return of a situation where all attention is focused
on political wheeling and dealing.
<p>On <u>23 July</u>, a few months after having been elected for a second
presidential term, Sali Berisha sent a letter of resignation from the presidency
of the Albanian republic, a post he had occupied for five years. Thus the
spectacle of national reconciliation was accomplished. It was the last
act arranged by the opposition to make the insurgents hand over their arms.
The aim &shy; <i>"to stabilise the situation, to restore the much mocked
authority of the State, to give the legitimacy which has been lost to a
future government and encourage an indispensable climate of national reconciliation"</i>
&shy; was finally attained.
<p>On <u>12 August</u> 1997, the six thousand men of the "multinational
protection force" left Albania.

<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">By Way of a Conclusion</font></u></h2>
In August 1995 we published a text ("General Characteristics of the Struggles
of the Present Time" &shy; in <i>Communism</i> No. 9) globalising, as the
title implies, the general characteristics of the struggles of recent years.
Faced with the enthusiasm-generating dimensions of the struggle in Albania,
we must reflect on the dimension and depth of the ruptures contained in
this struggle. Do they represent a qualitative jump in relation to the
general characteristics of struggles at the present time or not?
<p>To answer this question we can recall the characteristics set out in
August 1995 and look at them in connection with the events in Albania so
as to verify their similarities and differences.
<p>This text first of all emphasises the <b><i>violent and decisive actions
of the proletariat</i></b> who take over the streets, directly confronting
the structures of the State, its buildings, its police stations... and
tearing down the barriers of private property <b><i>in a general movement
of expropriation and reappropriation.</i></b>
<p>The events in Albania strongly confirm this characteristic. The proletariat
attacked police stations, secret police buildings, barracks, courts, prisons,
local offices of the government party, warehouses, branches of banks, the
houses of the bourgeoisie, commercial centres, businesses... fires aimed
at the destruction of centres of repression, capital accumulation, organisation
of the counter-revolution... looting gave way to collective appropriation
and reappropriation.
<p>Our text on the general characteristics of struggle makes the remark:
<i>"The
direct occupation of the streets tends to <b>break violently with all the
categories into which capital divides proletarians: the narrow confines
of the factories, mines or offices smash into pieces.</b> Unemployed, women
condemned to housework by capital, elderly people, children... are unified
in direct action."</i> As in Burma roughly ten years ago, these barriers
were blown apart in Albania and the struggle became generalised to all
sectors throughout the country.
<p>The looting was first of all aimed principally at the barracks because
the main objective of the movement, as it went from simple protest to insurrectionary
uprising, was to be armed. Following this it was aimed at the banks because
it was there that their savings had been swallowed. Then, faced with poverty,
they went for the food warehouses. Finally, the looting generalised to
shops, public buildings and factories, that is to say all the places where
commodities of every kind are stored, taking away everything, right up
to the walls, beams and roofs.
<p>The text also emphasises <b><i>the form of an unstoppable conflagration</i></b>
that takes over these revolts, without a quantitative progression of partial
struggles before the explosion, a characteristic accompanied by the fact
that the old arsenal of social democracy has no effect in the face of the
violent and decisive action of the proletariat and that trade unionism
is completely incapable of responding by limiting the generalisation of
proletarian violence. The reformist framework which normally controls attempts
at struggle is rapidly left behind.
<p>In Albania it is notable that policemen and soldiers (except for specialist
units and &eacute;lite troops) refused to fire on proletarians in struggle.
It is also remarkable that the turn taken by events created a brilliant
element of surprise which was undeniably an obstacle in the way of the
rapid mobilisation of the forces of counter-revolution.
<p>There were quite a few attempts to channel the more and more pressing
rumbling discontent into peaceful demonstrations and hunger strikes. But
these attempts were brutally swept away by the sudden and general explosion
of quasi-insurrectional movements. The use of arms became generalised and
the armed forces normally sent to put down revolt had to retreat. More
than this, many soldiers cast off their uniforms and joined their class
brothers and sisters, opening the barracks and contributing to the appropriation
of arms.
<p>Another characteristic outlined in the text of August 1995 is the fact
that: <b><i>"These revolts generally break out without precise and explicit
aims and rarely put forward anything positive."</i></b>
<p>In Albania we can see this absence of concrete positive demands, even
if the point of departure was the massive financial crookery which had
dispossessed the proletariat of its few savings. What was behind all this
was a situation which was totally precarious for the proletariat, an ever
more acute dispossession of its means of life. In Albania the cause was
clear but the rage which expressed itself on that occasion was a rage against
poverty in general. Moreover, the way in which this rage was carried by
the proletariat into a generalised revolt attacking not just the savings
companies but the whole of the structures of the bourgeois State, expresses
the much more total dimension taken by the struggle in Albania.
<p>Faced with the bourgeoisie's attack, in the concrete form of financial
crookery, what the proletariat did was to say <b>NO!</b> It is a question
of an explosion of rage which said NO and demanded back what had been stolen,
something which does not constitute a positive demand and is therefore
much harder to transform into a reformist proposition. During the whole
time of the social conflagration it was characterised by this intransigent
NO, and therefore by the absence of concrete positive demands.
<p>It is the bourgeois opposition which, in so far as the proletariat was
not able to give the revolt its own objectives, had breathed into the movement
the limiting demand for the dismissal of President Berisha, channelling
the movement of struggle against the State into a bourgeois policy of replacing
one government by another. It is precisely the question of the "resignation
of Berisha" which constitutes the passage from the proletarian NO confronting
a bourgeois order imposing an increase in misery to a recuperator's YES
making itself concrete in the political reform of the bourgeois State.
This demand appeared each time more opposed to the proletarian NO and finally
supplanted it and even made people forget the question of recovering the
money deposited in the banks.
<p>So far the movement in Albania corresponded generally with the characteristics
of the struggles of the present period set out in August 1995.
<p>But one characteristic which we stressed was that even in intense and
acute moments the power of bourgeois ideology is so strong that it is <b>only
a minority which participates in direct action</b>. The situation in Albania
was quite obviously different from this.
<p>The taking up of arms and participation in direct action were generalised.
It was the same for the settling of accounts with identified members of
the SHIK, the sacking of public buildings, town halls, courts, police stations,
prisons, the seizure of barracks, looting... While some acted more directly,
others, and sometimes many others, acted to prevent the forces of order
arriving on the scene of the real action. Proletarians in arms organised
themselves to block the roads, organised the defence of their bastions...
It is undeniable that in Albania the participation in direct action was
not just the act of a minority. It became massive, general.
<p>Our text stressed elsewhere that <b><i>once it gets over the element
of surprise, the bourgeois counter-offensive regains the upper hand</i></b>
and, with a great blow of the bludgeon, makes order return. Here also the
situation is notably different.
<p>In Albania the movement went further than most of the confrontations
which have happened in the present period (Los Angeles, for example) in
arming itself in a generalised fashion and making its struggle last longer
than a bolt of lightning in the sombre sky of extreme and general austerity
that capital imposes in an ever more crushing fashion across the world.
Between the moment when the struggle went beyond the suffocating framework
of peaceful demonstrations to become quasi-insurrectional, and the propagation
of the movement in the North of the country culminating in the evacuation
of Tirana by the bourgeois forces, two weeks of radicalisation and generalisation
of the movement had occurred.
<p>But this generalisation took place without the organisation of links
between the different areas touched by the movement. The insurrectional
movement embraced a third of Albania's territory like a trail of gunpowder.
That is to say that it was sufficient for a spark in one place to spread
the fire without any other effort, the echo of a victorious battle was
sufficient to encourage others to do the same. It is neither the lack of
enthusiasm nor of arms which can explain the fact that the insurgents remained
cantoned in their respective towns without trying to centralise the struggle.
It is once again the lack of perspectives, of the determination of class
objectives, which left them in the care of the <i>Committees of Defence</i>,
<i>of
Safety</i>, <i>of Public Salvation</i> which took charge of links by means
of the usual channels which the State always has in place: democratic representations
of various bourgeois parties, starting with the <i>Committees</i> of the
eight towns then through the organisation of national elections.
<p>As is stressed in the text of August 1995, in Albania the fact was verified
that the absence of revolutionary direction allows the <b><i>bourgeoisie
to regain control of the situation</i></b>.
<p><b><i>The bourgeoisie will always deny the class nature of confrontations</i></b>
and by that their internationalist dimension. That is they will do everything
to hide the fact that what expressed itself in Albania is a moment of a
single global struggle of the proletariat. The danger for the bourgeoisie
being precisely that proletarians across the whole world recognise themselves
in the struggle of their class brothers and sisters in Albania (and elsewhere)
and decide themselves to take up arms against the whole democratic apparatus
which has up till now made all the running! What the bourgeoisie say about
the events in Albania (like all the others which shake the world) is that
they obviously have no link with any of the others. In their eyes these
events can only be the result of particularisms.
<p>In this sense the main weakness of the proletariat in Albania finds
its source in the present day weakness of the struggles of the world proletariat.
To put it another way, the main weakness of the proletariat of that region
is its international isolation, the fact that elsewhere the proletariat
remains dominated and weak to the point that it is incapable of developing
similar actions to those of its class brothers and sisters in Albania.
Worse, it was incapable of understanding that it was its own class which
was fighting in Albania!
<p>There is another constant in the present day situation. This is the
lack of leadership and of revolutionary programme. These are decisive questions
in the course of action and are complementary to the absence of international
consciousness of the struggle. These two things which are lacking in the
world proletariat reinforce each other reciprocally. The tragedy of the
proletariat whose struggle in a region goes much further than in the others,
is a question which is as much historic as geographical and concerns its
program as well as its isolation. In this tragedy converges the lack of
theory and of revolutionary direction and the lack of struggle of the proletariat
in other regions of the world.
<p>It is thanks to this present day weakness of the world proletariat that
the bourgeoisie has been able to isolate <i>"the Albanian question"</i>
as a particular issue (as they have done with <i>"the Kurdish question"</i>).
Thus the bourgeoisie presents a spectacle of commiseration and compassion
and the press talk, <b>in a-classist terms</b>, of "Albanian" (national
division gives good results), of "victims" and of <i>"the despair which
has lead to such excesses"</i>, of <i>"abuses of power"</i>, of <i>"parasites
on democracy"</i> and of <i>"corrupt enterprises"</i>. They put forward
particularisms such as the <i>"difficulty of the poorest, most tribal country
in Europe, most marked by half a century of Stalinism... to come to terms
with freedom and the market economy"</i>... the <i>"difficulty of a people
who don't know the taste of work, of effort, of the spirit of sacrifice,
well enough... to take on the democratic apprenticeship"</i> (20). Social
democracy always defends the coexistence of different modes of production
(capitalist, socialist, feudal), different worlds (developed, under-developed,
third world, fourth world), different regimes (democratic, totalitarian)
so as to blame the "catastrophes", "dramas", "tragedies", "genocides" on
a lack of capitalist development and a lack of democracy. Never, of course,
are these events related to anything global, fundamental, common; in the
explanations of the media none of the present day catastrophes are linked
to the nature of this social form of production. It is a question of particular
problems which can be attributed to such and such a personality, to such
and such an irregularity or bad management. The most important thing for
the bourgeoisie is to impose a vision according to which each struggle
is the result of something different which has nothing to do with their
global system of exploitation. They must prevent proletarians in another
part of the world becoming aware that those who struggle are also proletarians.
They must prevent them understanding that it is the dictatorship of capital
which inevitably exacerbates exploitation and creates poverty and wars,
and that it is our struggle, the struggle of proletarians in arms against
the state, which will bring about the end of all this inhumanity.
<p>The bourgeoisie even has <b>other particularisms</b> in reserve, to
put in place to undermine the ground on which the proletariat in struggle
might be able to relaunch itself. Existing events have already allowed
them to realign the border conflicts with Greece, permitting the bourgeoisie
to play on the Greek nationalist/secessionist sentiment amongst the Greek
minority living mostly in the South of Albania (21). As long as the proletariat
struggles - a struggle which in its essence is unificatory and destructive
of all nationalist sentiment - the bourgeoisie cannot articulate its attack
on this level but, as we can see in the propaganda of different factions,
they have not moved away from the possibility of using a pro- or anti-Greek
sentiment to create separatist movements in the South of Albania in the
near future.
<p>Other fractions have launched the idea of an <i>"Ethnic Albania"</i>,
that is an Albanian state enlarged to Kosovo and Macedonia. They will then
try to mobilise the Albanian people in a struggle for national liberation/reunification.
<p>Another bourgeois polarisation that the journalists have put forward
to explain the difference in the strength of the movement in the South
and in the North is to divide the people of Albania into two big ethnicities:
the Gu&egrave;gues in the North and the Tosques in the South (22). Through
all these particularisms it is a question for the bourgeoisie of foreseeing
class confrontations and enclosing any movement in polarisations whose
two poles are bourgeois.
<p>With the first phase of the movement over, commiseration gave way to
condemnation of "excesses". All the misery in the world evidently never
justifies, in the eyes of the bourgeoisie, proletarians taking up arms.
The words which they then used to describe proletarians were no longer
"the Albanian poor" but "cannibals", "savages", "drunken louts", "uncontrollables",
"gangsters", "Mafia", "criminals", "bandits", "profiteers"... Some journalists
and Latin American members of parliament went so far as to say that the
situation in Albania was characterised by the presence in the streets of
masses of rapists escaped from the prisons. And of course, as we have already
stressed, by all these means they try to create an <b>amalgam</b> between
the armed actions of the proletariat and the armed actions of fractions
of the bourgeoisie defending their particular interests, however much the
criteria (ends and means) are completely antagonistic.
<p>By taking control of the situation the bourgeoisie always tries to <b>transform
the struggle against the whole of the system into a struggle for reform
of institutions</b>, to break the class strength, the links of solidarity,
the collective consciousness which develops in the struggle, and to lead
proletarians back on to the electoral path. To class strength the ballot
box opposes the isolated individual. To collective consciousness, they
reimpose a free will which necessarily reproduces the dominant ideology.
To direct links between proletarians in struggle outside and against the
structures of the bourgeois state, elections reimpose mediation by the
ballot paper.
<p>Finally, one last important characteristic that we set out in our text
on the characteristics of present day struggles was: <b><i>the big difference
between the strength of proletarian action and the lack of proletarian
consciousness of this action.</i></b>
<p>Despite the scale of the movement and the clarity of the class objectives
affirmed in the content of the actions themselves, there did not seem to
be any movement of minorities setting out the eminently classist content
of these actions which convey all the determinations of the struggle of
the proletariat against this deadly system, for the communist revolution.
It is obviously difficult to affirm the perspective of communism in a country
where exploitation has been carried on for decades in the name of communism.
But it is not fundamentally a question of a name. From the revolutionary
point of view, what is important is the development of avant-garde minorities
which proclaim the revolutionary significance of the movement and its attachment
to the world-wide struggle of a proletariat breaking from all the traps
of democracy. It is tragic that in Albania these minorities do not exist
or do not have in any case sufficient strength to make themselves known
and to try to give another direction to the revolt. And this is obviously
not a weakness specific to the proletariat in Albania, but a characteristic
of the world proletariat which, while it has received so many blows and
suffered so many defeats, has not even achieved a minimum of revolutionary
internationalist organisation.

<h2>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">oOo</font></h2></center>
While these latter remarks rather underline the limits of the movement,
they mustn't make us forget the moments of strength of the struggle of
the proletariat in Albania, a struggle which constituted a sudden break
in the ocean of social peace. The struggle of the proletariat in Albania
reminds us that the real critique of private property and the state, of
exploitation, of misery, of war... that is to say of the society of capital,
is the proletariat in arms against all the structures of the bourgeois
state. This struggle shows that when the proletariat decides to struggle
it makes use of a wonderful force which even the army cannot conquer.
<p>Everywhere the producers of all the world's wealth - the proletarians!
- allow themselves to be locked up in negootiations with the capitalists
whose only essential criteria is that of profitability. Everywhere the
democratic traps still lead proletarians by the nose to work or to slaughter.
Everywhere we hear: <i>"there's nothing to gain from struggle, nothing
will change"</i>. And even worse "tragedies", "genocides", "dramas", "catastrophes",
sow the seeds of death on all sides. The good citizen still concludes:
"that's life"!!!
<p>Proletarians have thus been kept at heel so much over the last few years
that their anger has too often remained profoundly hidden (23). So when
some of our class brothers and sisters finally let it explode and fight,
weapons in hand, against the capitalist State it really warms our hearts.
<p>By the actions which they have taken, proletarians in Albania have expressed
what proletarians throughout the entire world feel and, in that, they place
themselves in the avant-garde!
<p>The proletariat in Albania has made an echo of what all proletarians
carry within them: the struggle against capitalist exploitation, for communism.
This echo is such that, for example, in a village in Hungary, the workers
in a small construction company who hadn't received their wages marched
towards the boss' house shouting: <i>"it's time to do what they did in
Albania here!"</i> It was the same in Poland during a demonstration, angry
workers chanted: "Albania, Albania!" In other towns in Europe they also
shouted: "Vlor&euml;! Vlor&euml;!"
<p>The struggle of the proletariat in Albania has given renewed confidence
to the historic strength of the world proletariat.

<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">Notes</font></u></h3>
1. In this sense, yes, both points of view are subjective. But here the
comparison ends, because whilst it is in the interest of the bourgeois
point of view to <u>hide</u> anything announcing the end of capitalist
social order and it is thus logical that it would neglect and hide anything
revealing the obituary of its system, the point of view of the proletariat,
the point of view of communism, of the historical overtaking of capitalism,
has every interest <u>in recognising the objective reality</u> as it is,
to unveil the class contradiction which leads to the destruction of the
capitalist mode of production. This results in the subjective position
of the dominant class leading it to distance itself from objective reality,
whereas our subjective position as exploited pushes us to know and to make
known the objective reality.
<p>2. Enver Hoxha, historical stalinist leader and President of Albania
whose end in 1985 constituted the prelude to the death of "socialism in
one country".
<p>3. On this subject read the text "Situation actuelle de la restructuration
capitaliste en Russie" [The current situation of capitalist restructuration]
in <i>Communisme</i> No.44, December 1996.
<p>4. Each time, the bourgeoisie tries, by way of elections, to turn the
anger directed against the very essence of its domination, money, commodities,
capital, by exposing one or other party, one or other government to popular
condemnation. In March 1991, the electoral comedy gave the Socialist Party
(rechristened ex-Stalinist party) the star part. In March 1992, it was
the Democratic Party's turn, a new party founded in 1991 by Berisha (also
a rechristened ex-Stalinist), to take the leading role in the electoral
mascarade.
<p>5. In 1995, the turnover of this trade in "walking meat" of not only
Albanian, but also Kurdish, Chinese... origin reached 380 million dollars.
<p>6. These links were extremely personal: a whole series of government
and Democratic Party members were linked to these societies.
<p>7. Neighbouring Macedonia went through a similar situation with the
collapse of a speculative financial society, the TAT, which ruined thirty
thousand savers, to the tune of 80 million dollars. Another example is
Russia in 1994, S.Mavredi who, initially possessing just 50 dollars, promised
interest rates of 600% per year. He quickly managed thousands of dollars
before declaring himself bankrupt and ruining thousands of people. On his
release from prison, he got himself elected to the Duma! The oldest example
in the memory of the press dates back to 1919 in Boston, USA, where Ch.Ponzi
promised rates of 50% in 90 days. He thus collected 20 million dollars,
paid out 15 million and pocketed the other 5.
<p>8. Just as they repackage commodities, rethink publicity to sell it
better, the old secret police of the Stalinist period, the Sigourimi, were
given a new label and a new uniform. A few of the too-well-known leaders
were retired out, others reorientated towards employers' militias to watch
over the workplaces, cover the workers' assemblies... here was the SHIK
ready to recommence its nasty job. Nothing new! History repeats itself
all over the world and during every period: when a secret police force
has become too well-known for its repressive practice, its name is changed,
as are some of its members to enable them to assume their task more effectively.
This is particularly useful when they change the form (or rhetoric) of
domination and the State requires a bit of a clean-out. In general, the
same structure is maintained, the same files, the same buildings, the same
methods and they use the same prisons... except, of course, if the proletarian
revolt manages to wipe all of this out!
<p>9. On this subject read the articles that we have written at that time:
"Pologne: 'Solidarit&eacute;'... avec l'&eacute;conomie nationale" [Poland:
'Solidarity'... with the national economy] and "Pologne: quelle victoire?"
[Poland: what victory?] which were published in <i>Le Communiste</i> No.8
in November 1980; "Pologne: des accords de Gdansk au massacre" [Poland:
the Gdansk agreements to massacre], <i>Le Communiste</i> No.12, December
1981 and "Le&ccedil;ons des &eacute;v&eacute;nements de Pologne" [Lessons
of events in Poland] in <i>Le Communiste</i> No.13, March 1982.
<p>10. During the war in Yugoslavia the proletarians of this region engaged
in a very important struggle. Read on this subject the article: "Yugoslavia:
Imperialist War Against the World Proletariat" in <i>Communism</i> No.9,
August 1995.
<p>11. Cf. our articles "About the class struggle in Iraq" in this review:
"Additional notes on the insurrection of March 1991 in Iraq" and "Nationalism
and islamism against the proletariat"; read also "War or revolution" and
"A comrade's testimony: a journey to Iraq" in <i>Communism</i> No.7.
<p>12. We don't want to prejudge here whether minorities have adopted a
communist practice which situates them in the historic line of the party,
or whether this type of group will develop in the immediate future on the
basis of lessons learned. What we have to assert again is the lack of <b>strength</b>
of the revolutionary perspective, the small amount of organisation and
the absence of revolutionary propaganda proportional to the force and massive
scale of the movement in Albania.
<p>13. It should be very clear that we never use the term "revolutionary
leadership" in the immediate and restricted sense of a precise collection
of people, of a group or a "party". By revolutionary leadership we mean
the historic trajectory of the proletariat aiming at the realisation of
its revolutionary programme, looking to define the whole of the necessary
strategy which it must develop to destroy capitalism, looking to assert
the programmatic whole contained in its very existence as the opposition
to the society of capital, a programmatic whole which determines every
tactic and function of the revolutionary objective: communist society.
Thus the movement for the revolutionary destruction of capitalist society
can only develop itself in opposition to democracy which is the mode of
organisation of capital in all its forms. Cf. our "Theses of Programmatic
Orientation". As for people, groups and "parties", if they take on revolutionary
leadership it can only be in the historic sense.
<p>14. There are around 400 enterprises between Tirana, Durr&euml;s, Lushnj&euml;
and Fier. Some are the product of French and German initiatives and capital
but the majority are Italian. The most important 120 enterprises constitute
a mass of investments of 200 to 250 million dollars and comprise 30,000
jobs. In 1994, for example, the implantation of a bottling industry by
Coca-Cola necessitated an investment of 20 million dollars and a hundred
workers, in the high season!
<p>15. In exactly the same way that in Italy, the State created a category
of a-classist "armed band" with the ultimate aim of condemning <u>class</u>
violence! You can read about this subject in: "Italy: the Repression is
Reinforced" in <i>Communism</i> No.10, May 1997.
<p>16. On 19 March the Italian government decreed a state of emergency
over the whole territory of Italy until 30 June 1997. This involved the
reinforcement of controls exercised by the patrolling forces of order not
just on the frontiers but across the whole country. The decree also called
for the immediate repatriation of those who, linked in one way or another
to criminality, were considered to be undesirable &shy; a category which,
as we know from experience, is extendable to the all proletarians who have
taken up arms against the state. The same day, 289 people of Albanian origin
and considered dangerous were taken under heavy guard to Tirana on board
Italian army helicopters. Others received the status of "refugees" and
had the right to a resident's permit for 60 days, extendable to 90 days,
the time taken to "normalise" the situation in Albania. Independent of
the content of their respective ideologies the collaboration between police
forces was total, as always!
<p>17. On 20 March 400 refugees whose boat was on the point of sinking
into the Adriatic were led back to the port of Durr&euml;s by the Italian
army. On 28 March, following an intervention on the high seas by an Italian
army motor launch to force a boat full of migrants to change direction,
the overfull boat sank, leaving 87 dead and/or disappeared. On 4 May, 1223
migrants who had arrived in the Italian port of Bari piled on board a tanker
were returned to Albania. The first group of 180 men was immediately returned
under strong escort to Durr&euml;s. The boat had been bought for 100,000
dollars and each passenger had paid between 500 and 600 dollars for the
trip. The greater is the scale of human misery, the higher is the rate
of profit; in this case capital recovered the whole of its investment in
a single cycle!
<p>18. We have already stressed the kind of intervention policy of the
US state as well as its fundamental orientation. Cf. "L'arm&eacute;e et
la politique militaires des Etats-Unis d'Am&eacute;rique" in <i>Le Communiste</i>
No.12 and 13. The Albanian example clearly expresses the understanding
of this state, with regards to which action to take when the proletarian
struggle attacks the State.
<p>19. The word for polling booth is "isoloir" (isolator) in French!
<p>20. In the present day world you can't talk about the proletariat anymore,
or about revolutionary struggle, or about revolt against capitalism and
its state but always about the struggle of "Kurds", "Islamists", "employees",
"disaster victims", "peasants", "Palestinians", "the starving", "those
who are owed 5 months wages", "miners", "Latinos", "the poor", "Basques",
"unemployed", "blacks", "students", "Indians", "ecologists"... They use
these terms to the point of absurdity to show these situations as anachronistic
particularisms due to a lack of capitalism and democracy.
<p>21. The Greek minority represent around 12% of the Albanian population,
more than 500,000 people living principally in the villages of Southern
Albania. Until 1913 this region was part of Greece and is still called
the Empire of the North by Greeks today.
<p>22. Read on this subject the article denouncing the polarisation between
Hutus and Tutsis imposed by force by the bourgeoisie in Rwanda and in the
surrounding countries: "Les campagnes humanitaires contre le prol&eacute;tariat,
l'exemple du Rwanda" appearing in <i>Communisme</i> No.41.
<p>23. Worse still, the rage caused by all these miseries and fed by the
competition intrinsic to bourgeois society is frequently drained towards
"the other worker", towards the immigrant, towards the "black"... towards
women, children, such and such an ethnic group... then, finally, organised
by capitalism and transformed into a racist military force in imperialist
war.

<font face="Comic Sans MS">We have published several articles describing
the insurrections of March 1991 in Iraq, which were written as and when
information was able to reach us. Shortly after the end of the Gulf War,
we also published in French the text "Prol&eacute;tariat contre nationalisme"
(<i>Communisme</i> No.36) in which, from a distance of just over a year,
we tried to draw the lessons from these struggles.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">From an even greater distance, we are now
returning to this question with some supplementary notes centred on the
lessons of the insurrection and articulated principally around three axes:
the contradictory development of workers' associationism in the appearance
of the shoras, the strengths and limits of the insurrectionary actions
of the proletariat, new inter-bourgeois wars in the region and the tasks
of the proletariat. These notes have been taken from our central review
in Spanish (<i>Comunismo</i> No.35) which appeared in October 1994. Since
then, other information has reached us about the development of nationalism
and Islamism as means put in place by the local bourgeoisie to dissolve
the proletariat and to lead even those who fought side by side in the insurrection
to turn their guns against each other. This information has been assembled
in a text which follows
<i>"Additional Notes..."</i> that we have entitled
<i>"Nationalism
and Islam against the Proletariat"</i>.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">We want to draw our readers' attention in
particular to the lessons arising from the insurrection in Sulaymaniyah.
What was at stake - as in all insurrections of our class throughout history
- was how to develop the revolution in alll aspects of social life once
the insurrection had been accomplished and how to avoid the confiscation
of the social revolution by its transformation into a simple political
"revolution", a simple change of government.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">What happened in Iraq does not only show
the reality of the contradiction capitalism/communism, but also its future.
Capitalist inhumanity is developing everywhere. Everywhere war presents
itself as an alternative to the real capitalist crisis. And everywhere
the outline of a communist response to this and to all capital's barbarism
is beginning to appear. This point is aimed at all those who think that
"civilised" Europe will be forever spared the barbarism of war which swept
across this part of the world only fifty years ago. It is useful to point
out that the alternative "war or revolution" is the same everywhere and
that the threat of Europe being transformed into a huge battlefield is
just as real as that hanging over other parts of the world so far spared
by military conflicts. "Here" too, the war waged by capital on the proletariat
must develop to the destructive intensity with which it was conducted "over
there" in Iraq. "Here" too, the only possible way to break the chains of
this deathly system, which drags us ineluctably to war, remains the struggle
for revolution.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Discussion of the lessons from the insurrection
in Iraq are situated within this urgency. We appeal to our readers to share
their opinions and critiques with us on this particular question, to enable
us to develop together a community of struggle against war, the prefiguration
of a real human community where Capital, the State, classes and social
relations based on exchange and money have finally disappeared.</font>

<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">Some notes on the shoras: proletarian associationism
and bourgeois recuperation</font></u></h2>
The shoras in Iraq, like all types of elementary regroupment of the proletariat,
are a necessary form of the process of centralisation of the proletariat's
force. They suffer from all the contradictions that our class contains
within itself as a class and as a force antagonistic to capital yet dominated
ideologically by the bourgeoisie. Take, for example, the Soviets in Russia.
In 1905 as in 1917, they constituted structures of proletarian struggle
contributing to the insurrection without making, either in 1905 or twelve
years later, the necessary ruptures from the terrain of bourgeois democratic
socialism and without making themselves independent of the political organisations
which led them. This assured that, in the end, they were completely recuperated
by the capitalist and democratic organisation of the State, under the reign
of leninism and post-leninism. Apologists for the Soviets always forget,
as if by magic, that the Congress of Soviets approved and implemented every
level of Stalin's policies. The same thing happened in Germany with the
workers' councils between 1918 and 1921. Having effectively emerged as
structures of struggle outside and against the unions, the councils ended
up no less dominated by bourgeois democracy, incarnated in various social
democratic forces and transformed themselves into structures for the organisation
of the bourgeois State against the proletariat.
<p>In Iraq as well (just as in Iran between 1979 and 1982) the shoras,
rising out of the flames of the struggle, contained enormous contradictions,
the class oppositions between revolution and counter-revolution being defined
within them. This is why, contrary to the councilists and the sovietists
who make an uncritical apology of the shoras, we have tried, in this process,
to seize upon the strengths and weaknesses of the proletariat by supporting
and acting openly to assert the revolutionary pole.
<p>As we can see from their slogans and flags, the shoras concentrated
the same type of strengths and weaknesses as the councils, the soviets
and other proletarian organisations characteristic of insurrectionary moments.
Side by side with democratic, nationalist and even openly conservative
demands, are slogans expressing the combativity, strength and class determination
of workers in struggle.
<p>The shoras were structured within and for the struggle. Nevertheless,
that doesn't mean that they appeared in a spontaneous manner, as is always
claimed by the adherents of spontaneism and councilism. Historic spontaneous
necessity, as in the case of the Russian soviets or the councils in other
countries, always concretises itself in the real flesh and blood men and
women who <b>organise</b> these structures in a conscious and deliberate
way. As we will show later, the appearance of the shoras was preceded by
a "league" or committee formed from a insurrectionist minority organised
to prepare for insurrection.
<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">Some elements of the revolutionary conspiracy
and the insurrection in Sulaymaniyah</font></u></h2>
While proletarians prepared themselves, armed themselves, in the various
districts of Sulaymaniyah, a collection of militants who had regrouped
prior to the open struggle in a "League for an Insurrectionary Uprising"
called for the creation of shoras in neighbourhoods and factories. A real
committee of insurrection was thus constituted, thanks to which a unified
decision was able to be made to unleash the insurrection at a precise moment.
The committee was composed of a collection of existing political organisations
as well as independent militants. It planned the outbreak of the insurrection
simultaneously in 53 nerve centres of the town (key crossroads, buildings
and central points of neighbourhoods) which afterwards became the basis
of the shoras. At that time, the nationalists did not participate as such
in the committee and did not flaunt themselves in any of the centres of
the insurrectionary neighbourhoods.
<p>Only a minority of proletarians was armed and organised, and that is
why the committee launched a set of appeals and directives to seize arms
where they could be found. At the same time, a collection of revolutionary
organisations assumed the indispensable role of arming themselves and arming
the proletariat. "Communist Perspective", for example, gave themselves
the task of distributing grenades, guns and ammunition at key points as
well as arming some members of the committee. Other groups, such as the
"Communist Action Group" (CAG), who participated in the committee as well
as in various local structures and in the shoras, gave themselves the task
of expropriating the clan chiefs of their houses and their armed centres
so as to seize arms and to arm the proletariat. Without this preliminary
conspiratorial action of the organised avant-garde, it would not have been
possible to win the insurrectional battle of March 1991 in Sulaymaniyah.
<p>This is what a comrade told us:
<blockquote><i>"The proletariat searched desperately for arms but only
the communist, marxist forces armed the proletariat and decided on insurrection.
The nationalists did not participate. As for us, we organised ourselves
into groups to attack the houses of the clan chiefs. In general each detachment
only had one bazooka and some light weapons. The attack began with the
bazooka and we tried to seize the stockpiles of arms as quickly as possible.
We had made an inventory quite a long time beforehand and that's how we
knew where to look for arms. Another important aspect of the preparation
carried out by revolutionary groups had been to make a collection of field
'hospitals' available to the insurrection for tending to the wounded."</i></blockquote>
Despite all that, the organisation and arming remained insufficient, which,
in certain cases, was paid for on the part of the proletariat by deaths
and injuries and by partial defeats.
<p>Another comrade gave us his version:
<blockquote><i>"I only realised that preparations were being made for insurrectional
action two days beforehand, when a revolutionary comrade gave me various
precise instructions: I had to go to a particular place between 7 and 8
am, armed as best I could be. When I arrived at the gathering there were
only seven of us. At that moment I told myself that we could not win. Later
on, I heard that the majority of the committee had launched the insurrection
also thinking that it would not be able to triumph but that in any case
it would be an important step forward in the struggle and the autonomy
of the proletariat. A moment later, two comrades from 'Rawti' ('Communist
Perspective') appeared, calling on us to gather together for the insurrection.
They distributed some grenades. Together we went around the nearby streets
calling for struggle and in an instant we had gathered together some 50
or 60 people. It was at that time that two well-armed peshmergas arrived.
The insurgents appealed to them and shouted out to them to join us in the
movement but they didn't (1). Despite being a small group and completely
inferior from the point of view of weapons, we attacked the local barracks,
but it was too well protected. We fled, were repulsed and then pursued.
Our comrade Bakery Kassab, a militant of Communist Perspective, died during
this attack. We dispersed in a completely disorderly manner and ran as
fast as we could. The enemy, better armed, chased us and we were surrounded
until we arrived on the main street. As soon as we got there, a great surprise
awaited us: the insurrection had gained ground and now it was the Ba'athists
who were retreating."</i></blockquote>
These facts, along with so many others that various comrades and organisations
of struggle have reported, enable us to assert that despite the existence
of this insurrectional committee, initially the driving force behind, then
centraliser, of the shora structures, real centralisation remained very
relative. There were enormously chaotic aspects to it and many proletarian
fighters went out into the streets with whatever they had to hand, without
any structure of centralisation apart from what they "spontaneously" encountered
in the street, without any instructions apart from that a friend had told
them to go to such and such a place. Detachments of armed proletarians
formed themselves very rapidly to carry out some action then dispersed
again: often comrades on the same side of the barricades who had not known
each other previously forged strong links and, after the insurrection,
went on to a structure of political organisation. It is precisely the existence
of all those heterogenous action groups participating in different actions
which prevents a global understanding of the movement: there are no two
protagonists who have experienced the same situation and even less who
have perceived it politically in the same way. Thus for example, certain
versions strongly stress the operational autonomy of little groups centralised
by different combative structures (Communist Perspective, GAC...) as a
decisive element of the insurrection, and others insist more on the strength
of some 30,000 proletarians (only a few of whom had a weapon) who responded
to a call from a shora and gathered in their "headquarters", the Awat school.
According to the latter, the assembly was to prove decisive in dynamising
the whole process because they went on from there to win important battles.
To give an idea of the consciousness which drove these proletarians (as
much in its strength as in its weakness) here are a few of the slogans
which predominated in the assemblies:

</table></center>

<p>Despite the contradictions, the insurrection went on to impose itself,
the repressive forces suffering numerous losses in several confrontations.
Often they were liquidated in their own homes. In an attempt to save their
own skins, the enemy concentrated themselves in the famous "red building"
and the surrounding barracks, and it was there that an immense battle raged
with numerous losses on both sides. The insurgents attacked without any
unified plan, firing in all directions, wounding and killing numerous fighters
in their own ranks (ours!).
<p>The security forces were well aware that to surrender would mean death.
They also had everything to play for, knowing perfectly well that, despite
being armed to the teeth, their task would be difficult. Up until the last
moment they remained in permanent communication with Baghdad which promised
the imminent arrival of reinforcements. Profiting from the terrible lack
of weapons on the side of the insurgent proletariat, the soldiers threw
guns from the windows of the red building. Hundreds and hundreds of proletarians
threw themselves forward to grab them, thus making themselves easy targets
for the shots of well-armed and well-positioned troops. This increased
the number of victims on the side of the insurrection even further (2).
<p>However, the rage and determination of the proletariat was so great
that finally resistance was crushed and it took over the whole town. Step
by step, the "red building", all the barracks and the houses in the military
quarter were conquered. On the facades of buildings the marks and holes
left by bullets bear testimony to the class war. Soldiers surviving the
attack were taken out one by one and judged. Today some comrades estimate
a figure of 600 soldiers shot, others say 2,000, but without doubt they
are including executions which took place over those days across the whole
of the town.
<p>It is important to understand that it is at the heart of the action,
in these very moments when proletarians are carrying out exemplary acts,
that the struggle for the autonomy of the movement is played out. In effect,
despite the fact that during all this time the nationalists did not participate
in the process in an organised manner, the insurgents could not do without
them, even less confront them openly as demanded by the revolutionary internationalist
nuclei of the region. Thus, the fact that certain proletarian fighters
went and consulted the bosses of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK)
in the mountains about what they should do with captured soldiers and torturers,
clearly reflects and expresses the contradictions of the movement and the
ambivalence of the shoras. Noshirwan, the military chief of the PUK, insisted
that the enemy should not be executed, arguing that <i>"we can use them
later"</i> (!?!). Similar events took place subsequently, illustrating
the ambivalence of some of the shoras. The proletariat's lack of confidence
in itself incited it to ask its worst enemies to take decisions and to
direct operations. Several sectors of the proletariat, unaware of their
own strength, looked to the official opposition because to them it seemed
serious and effective. Other members of the shoras adopted the exact opposite
position: they wanted to kill the soldiers and drag their bodies through
the streets so that everyone will know <i>"the kind of torture that these
bloodthirsty monsters are capable of inflicting on proletarians"</i>. Finally,
except for certain torturers famous for their cruelty who were torn to
pieces by the insurgents, pure and simple liquidation imposed itself, but
not without problems and stormy discussions on the subject of who deserved
to die. In effect, as in many other towns in Kurdistan, the Ba'athist repressive
forces had lived concentrated in their districts: they had tortured there,
killed there... and, just a few yards away, the torturers' families slept,
ate and lived. They were so hated that they couldn't live elsewhere. What's
more, the majority of families of the torturers (particularly the women)
participated in the tortures. The buildings (the central block, the interrogation
rooms, the family houses, the torture centres) were laid out in such a
way that it is difficult to imagine that anyone could live there without
participating in some way or another in the torture and murder of prisoners.
When proletarians took over these places, they didn't waste time discussing
or judging, the class hatred was such that some groups executed all those
that they found inside without any criteria apart from the physical barrier.
But, in the majority of cases, more class criteria were imposed. Thus,
in Sulaymaniyah, children and some women who had not participated in tortures
and executions of prisoners were spared. They were allowed to leave the
building before the massive execution of military torturers and their family
accomplices.
<p>The insurrection spread itself like a lighted gunpowder trail, with
similar uprisings breaking out in other towns being equally successful.
In Irbil, 42 shoras were created and, in only three hours of fighting,
armed proletarians became masters of the situation. Then came Kalar, Koya,
Shaqlawa, Akra, Duhok, Zakho... The barracks close to the towns, like the
enormous military installations of Sulaymaniyah, strategic centre of the
whole region, were surrounded by deserters and other armed proletarians.
The central forces succeeded in saving a few army officers by taking them
away in helicopters. The rest, the mass of soldiers, surrendered without
a fight and the majority passed over to the side of the insurrection.
<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">The limits of proletarian activity and the
counter-revolutionary activity of the nationalists</font></u></h2>
If the level of consciousness, organisation and centralisation of the proletariat
was sufficient to bring about the triumph of the insurrection, the same
was not the case when it came to assuming the <b>essence of revolution</b>,
knowing how to organise everyday life and to impose itself dictatorially
against capital in places where it had triumphed. As in other historic
circumstances in which the constitution of the proletariat into a party
is insufficient and not well centralised in a communist direction, in Kurdistan,
bourgeois forces took over the leadership of the action, liquidating the
autonomy of the proletariat and ended up by expropriating the revolution
so as to transform it into a bourgeois "revolution" (an exclusively political
"revolution"), or rather, into an anti-revolution, a face-lift for the
State facade, a changing of the fractions in power in order to preserve
the essence of the system of exploitation.
<p>The nationalists only began to participate actively in the direct action
with an effective presence on the streets two or three days after the victory
of the insurrection. Their first acts consisted of taking money from the
banks and seizing military vehicles, occupying buildings and other properties
abandoned by the government, which proletarians had taken and then also
abandoned (3). This abandonment of premises, of heavy artillery, of vehicles...
showed that, although capable of fighting <b>against an enemy</b>, the
proletariat did still not have the strength to fight
<b>for itself</b>,
to take over the direction of the revolution which it had started. To put
it another way, our class expressed its conception of revolution: a purely
negative negation of today's world, a simple rejection, a simple negation,
without asserting that <b>the revolutionary negation of this world contains
a positive negation</b>. The proletariat has the force to expropriate but
not the force to <b>reappropriate what it has expropriated</b> nor to transform
it in a revolutionary way towards its universal revolutionary objectives.
As in Russia in 1917, politicism constitutes a dominant ideology even amongst
the most committed proletarians. They know what to do against the Ba'athists
but when it is a question of socially confronting capital, they are lost.
This general limitation results from a confusion (widespread in our class)
which systematically amalgamates the State and the Ba'athists, the struggle
against capital and the struggle against the government. This generalised
confusion that communist and internationalist fractions did not have the
force to liquidate was preciously maintained and developed by the nationalists.
It is still very useful to them today.
<p>Once the nerve centres of the town had been occupied, the heavy artillery
and the military vehicles controlled by the nationalists, the rest was
just a matter of time. Over a few days (between the 7 and 20 March) the
nationalists, who up until then had hardly been present and had "followed"
the masses, progressively took control of the situation. The revolutionary
groups and the most active proletarians were incapable of giving and taking-on
clear military directives. They did not know what to do with the barracks,
tanks and military vehicles. They made do with arming themselves with ammunition
and light weapons and, at the best, burning vehicles to prevent the nationalists
from taking them. Not only did they fail to give themselves the means of
controlling the production and distribution of the necessities of life,
but they didn't even stock up with the indispensable minimum of food, medicines,
means of propaganda etc.
<p>On their arrival in the town the nationalists appealed for the dissolution
of the shoras, but did not obtain any result. Later, from a position of
strength, after taking the strategic points, they made use of the much
more effective method of negotiation and wearing down the proletariat.
Although, as we saw earlier, there were shoras dominated or strongly influenced
by democratic and nationalist positions, the Central organ of the shoras,
despite the participation of bourgeois parties and organisations, defined
itself as being "for communism", for "the abolition of wage labour" and
came out openly against the nationalists.
<p>Little by little, as they structured their effective power over the
town with the support and blessing of the intervention forces of the world
bourgeoisie, the nationalists, who had still not succeeded in destroying
the shoras, attempted to take them over by integrating their militants
in them and imposing their own bourgeois leadership. It was at that time
that a collection of shoras which were nationalist, social-democratic,
populist and partisans of the great popular front against Saddam Hussein
appeared for the first time.
<p>At the same time, the nationalists, wanting to shatter the force expressed
by the Central shora, proposed negotiations which were to lead it to the
tragedy of all assemblist-democratic functioning and place it in the position
of being incapable of adopting a single revolutionary direction. The Central
was divided: on one side, there were those who considered the nationalists
as enemies and who were opposed to all negotiation; on the other, those
who accepted negotiation and who concentrated a collection of confusion
and inconsistencies on the question of nationalism, embracing the ideology
of a great anti-Ba'athist popular front.
<p>It is clear that the problem is not whether to negotiate or not. However,
the acceptance of negotiation with the nationalists against the Ba'athists
in such circumstances contains, as an implicit and undeniable presupposition,
the ideology of <b>the lesser evil</b> and, ultimately, <b>frontism</b>.
In fact "realism" triumphed, leading to the bulk of the movement renouncing
its own interests. From the moment when negotiation was accepted, two decisive
elements in the liquidation of the autonomy and interests of the proletariat
imposed themselves. Firstly, the fact of considering Saddam as the main
enemy and Kirkuk as an essential objective and, secondly, the necessity
for order against chaos.
<p>As the proletariat had been unable to impose its law, proletarian resistance
and even expropriations necessary for survival came to be considered as
a form of chaos, such that the nationalists were able to present themselves
(and were perceived) as the only guarantee of the maintenance of order.
Immediately the peshmergas began to enforce respect for capitalist order
and bourgeois property. They arrested proletarians who "stole" a sack of
rice to eat, and, discreetly, disarmed isolated proletarians (at that time
the peshmergas had neither the strength nor the courage to interfere with
internationalist groups).
<p>Here we must make an important digression on the subject of the war
to take Kirkuk. From the start of the insurrection in Sulaymaniyah, the
nationalists penetrated in force the Central shora, not merely submitting
to it, but formally taking over its leadership, obviously using the proletarians
who placed themselves under their orders as cannon fodder. Working on the
basis that, for proletarians, the extension of the revolt and solidarity
with the recently formed shoras in Kirkuk was a logical objective, the
nationalists pursued a completely different aim. It was a question partly
of submitting the proletariat to a structured war, attacking the Ba'athist
positions in a town where they were the best prepared military force, and
partly a question of taking a strategic role in imperialist war, by occupying
this petroleum centre of prime importance, something which would augment
their power of negotiation nationally and internationally. For us this
constituted a key moment in <b>the transformation of the class war into
imperialist war</b>. From the taking of Kirkuk the nationalists negotiated
openly with the Ba'athists under the benevolent eye of the Coalition forces.
For the first time they were recognised as a credible force, not just because
they territorially controlled a capitalist centre as important as Kirkuk,
but also because, for the first time, they appeared capable of contesting
the proletariat's control of the situation in the insurgent towns, thus
to be an effective fraction of international bourgeois order, capable of
controlling the proletariat, the central preoccupation of the Coalition
at the end of the war.
<p>Of course, some shoras, like those of "Communist Perspective" and others
in which the presence of internationalist militants was important, tried
to participate in the action in a autonomous way, but the nationalists
rapidly gained the upper hand. Taking over everything, it was they who
held the money, the meeting halls, the indispensable heavy weapons, the
medicines and other equipment for treating the wounded, and therefore the
material force to impose their orders. Many internationalist comrades reproached
"Communist Perspective" and other groups for not having completely broken
with the shoras at that moment and for having continued to participate
in the committee. It was a key moment in which the programmatical weaknesses
of the avant-garde groups of the region were borne out. As some of them
were to recognise subsequently, it was not enough to define Kurdish nationalism
and the Shi'ite muslim movement as bourgeois social movements, it was also
necessary to correctly evaluate the possibility of these forces imposing
themselves. It was as indispensable to confront them in daily practical
activity as it was the Ba'athists.

<tr>
<td><font face="Comic Sans MS">We cannot help making a historical parallel
between the situation in Iraq in 1991 and what happened in Spain in 1936
after the triumph of 19 July. In both cases the proletarian insurrection
triumphed over part of the territory of a country, starting in a key town
(Barcelona-Sulaymaniyah), leaving the rest of the country in the hands
of the "fascist" fraction (Franco-Saddam). In both cases the proletariat
armed itself and confronted this "fascist" enemy by acting outside and
against the populist and democratic organisations ("Communist" republicans,
social democrats... and in general the whole parliamentary spectrum of
the bourgeoisie) without managing to impose its own class dictatorship.
In both cases the proletariat triumphed militarily, creating its own unitary
class organisations (committees of workers, peasants, soldiers and sailors
- shoras), and its victory was prepared byy conspiratorial and avant-garde
military action by revolutionary groups that had been constituted a long
time before ("Solidarios", "Nosotros"... "Communist Perspective", CAG,
SSFA...). Nevertheless, equally in both cases, the proletariat, incapable
of assuming its dictatorship socially, found itself paralysed at the moment
of its triumph by the absence of revolutionary direction in the most programmatical
and practical sense of the word: it did not know which direction to take.
Situating itself clearly against the counter-revolution in its most open
forms in order to crush it, it was incapable (despite all the talk and
the flags) of acting practically for social revolution. In both cases the
"fascist" enemy continued the war and the republican enemy, profiting from
the lack of social initiative by the proletariat, stroked it gently (as
you might stroke a pig to calm it down before slitting its throat) and
invited it to negotiations to form an alliance in a war against "the main
enemy". Support for this popular war in which republicans and democrats
were recognised as allies (that is to say imperialist war) encountered
enormous proletarian resistance. But in both cases there was another element.
This element enabled a significant fraction of the majority of the proletarian
forces to become engaged in a struggle against "fascists", which immediately
took on the form of a war with a front (adapted to imperialist war and
totally inappropriate for the development of social revolution). It also
enabled the republicans to present themselves as indispensable in winning
the battle, at the very moment when they were strengthening their positions
in the rest of the country against the autonomy of the proletariat. This
element was, in both cases, a town (highly symbolic for historical reasons).
A town in which the revolutionary proletariat waged a desperate battle
against an enemy superior in arms. In Spain in 1936 this was Saragossa.
It was for Saragossa, in the interminable battle for its reconquest, that
the struggle at the rear against the bourgeois republic was sacrificed
and that a large part of the best forces - in the sense of class autonomy
- of the proletariat was wasted. In Iraq iin 1991 that town was Kirkuk.
Not only did the proletarian shoras give their best forces to win this
battle, but it was also thanks to this battle that the nationalists marked
an important step (at the front as at the rear) in the consolidation of
the anti-Saddam front.</font></td>

<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">The present situation and perspectives: New
inter-bourgeois wars in the region and the tasks of the internationalist
proletariat</font></u></h2>
All the information which has come out of Iraq in 1995/1996/1997/... indicates
that the material, social and political situation of the proletariat <b>continues
to worsen</b>. Growing poverty, isolation, repression, permanent military
mobilisation, armed struggle between bourgeois fractions, forced recruitment
and all the rest. Survival is a matter of chance and everyone is subjected
to permanent danger. Every day proletarians are killed by stray bullets
or in confrontations between bourgeois fractions. To survive you sell your
furniture, your crockery, everything you have. The problem is that there
are no buyers. What's more, it is not unusual for the peshmergas responsible
for maintaining order to want one of the objects on sale and to have the
seller thrown in prison so as to confiscate it legally.
<p>In Kurdistan the situation is hellish: lack of food, shortage of water,
a violent deterioration in the level of hygiene. The fear of looting has
unleashed <b>open warfare between bourgeois fractions</b>, between nationalists
and between some fractions of the PUK and the islamists.
<p>The conflicts between the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) and the Patriotic
Union of Kurdistan (PUK) are at such an explosive point that Kurdistan
is actually divided into two regions which are on a war footing. For the
first time in history the two regions have become an arena of political
rivalry. The development of regionalism, as everywhere, constitutes a force
for the disorganisation of proletarian struggle. So today, on one side
there is Soran with Sulaymaniyah as its "capital", controlled by the PUK
(Talabani) and on the other, Badinan (region of origin of Barzani's family)
where Zakho and Duhok are under the control of the KDP. Arbil is the only
town which is under the simultaneous and contradictory control of the two
bourgeois forces, also constituting a border between the two regions.
<p>The inter-bourgeois struggle takes on very violent forms. The two fractions
of capital try to mobilise the proletariat into their service and to channel
all class contradictions, which would normally develop against private
property and the State, in its direction. One example: after the war, many
inhabitants of Sulaymaniyah and other towns in the region departed for
the countryside where they settled to build farms and cultivate the soil.
This land belonged to big bourgeois families (in this case to Barzani's
KDP (4)) who now want to take back the land and expel the occupants. But
some decided to refuse to be expelled, organising and defending themselves,
with guns at the ready. The fighting led to many deaths on both sides.
The PUK, profiting from this situation, presented itself as the spokesman
of the struggle against the KDP's intended expulsions and, on this basis,
contained (and/or tried to contain) this elementary struggle for survival
by attempting to lead it onto the terrain of interfractional warfare. Nevertheless,
the conflict created contradictions on both sides. For example, during
the armed conflict, Talabani, who was in Holland at the time, did not dare
to return to Kurdistan from fear of being done in, including by his own
troops.
<p>The route to Soran was blocked by the KDP for two months on the pretext
of war. The direct consequence of this was that supplies stopped coming
into the region, the shops emptied and people died of hunger. Movement
between the two zones was difficult and dangerous because, despite the
fact that the frontier had been officially opened a short while before,
the situation remained so explosive that people from Soran no longer risked
venturing into the Badinan region and vice versa. There were dozens of
ceasefires and peace treaties but the confrontations didn't stop. Officially,
the number of deaths in these battles is estimated at 2,500. The various
headquarters of the KDP in the Soran region were attacked and pillaged
by the PUK and vice versa in Badinan.
<p>Daily life turned into a nightmare: while skirmishes increased between
the KDP and the PUK, prices tripled every three months. This hell pushed
many people to enrol with the peshmergas so that they would be assured
of food and money three or four times a month, as well as the authorisation
to keep the arms in their possession, arms which, if they were not used
against their own officers, enabled these peshmergas to defend their own
lives.
<p>For quite a while now, neither the KDP nor the PUK have been able to
control their troops. They have become autonomous and are imposing the
law of the jungle to survive: they have invented new taxes and indulge
in all sorts of extortion in the name of their organisation without informing
it. Thus, in Arbil, the peshmergas plundered the shops in broad daylight,
which had nothing to do with the official policies of the KDP or the PUK.
It has been a common practice and people have to defend their homes with
guns at the ready.
<p>Nevertheless, when elections were announced for March 1995, the two
main bourgeois fractions in Kurdistan tried to reorganise their troops
in the face of the enemy. At the same time, they tried to improve their
relations with the Western bourgeoisie and competed for the support of
the American State Department as well as various parts of the Western military
apparatus. The two parties oscillated between aggressive and peaceful policies,
depending on their respective capacity to control the proletariat and on
the state of their relations with the forces of the world imperialist order.
Thus, at one point, Barzani declared himself in favour of peace, of reuniting
families, of respect for trade and of arriving at a compromise which would
allow elections to be held and thus appeared to stand for Kurdish national
reconciliation. Talabani, although even less able to control his own troops,
undoubtedly appreciated the bourgeoisie's incapacity of offering a viable
alternative to proletarian struggle more clearly (a bourgeoisie who only
saw the possibility for social peace in the repolarisation of the bourgeoisie
and in war) and presented himself more as a partisan of a military solution,
as much against Barzani as against the Ba'athists. He talked openly about
a military offensive and of the occupation of Kirkuk. But, as we have said
several times before, it is absurd to talk of one fraction of the bourgeoisie
being more aggressive, more militarist or more imperialist than another.
It is Capital that is militarist and aggressive and, generally, the fraction
which is strongest on the military plain, obtains the best results on that
terrain and makes the other fraction appear to be the most militarist (as
happened in the "Second" World War). It is no great surprise that the fraction
which made a qualitative leap in the hostilities found itself relatively
isolated on the international plane (5) and strategically rather weak in
controlling its own forces and imposing its interests. (Despite various
rumours that circulate to the effect that someone or other <i>"is supported
by the CIA"</i>, it is difficult to know what the alliances and engagements
actually are because they are shrouded in the greatest secrecy).
<p>Local wars, blockades, hunger and state terrorism are the main perspectives
that capitalism continues to offer in the region. All fractions of the
bourgeoisie, be they Islamists, Nationalists, Ba'athists or whatever, implored
the population to respect the lorries filled with supplies coming from
Turkey and crossing Kurdistan every day in the direction of Baghdad. There
is nothing more logical than their getting together to deprive the proletariat
of all property, including what is necessary for survival. But fortunately,
there are always proletarians who stick two fingers up at such orders and
confront sacrosanct Private Property. The following is a real and exemplary
story which dates back to 1993. Not far from Sulaymaniyah, on a road which
passes close to a remote district, several supply lorries had been attacked
and pillaged. In an attempt to put a stop to these attacks, the authorities
sent a number of delegations charged with renewing dialogue to stop the
looting. One after the other, each attempt failed. Later the organised
sectors who had carried out these expropriations took things a step further
and declared that, from that day on, they would, for their subsistence,
systematically seize one out of every three lorries. The nationalists from
Sulaymaniyah sent one of their most popular leaders, who had distinguished
himself in the struggle against the Ba'athists, his mission being to find
a
solution with the people of the district. When he presented himself there,
surrounded by bodyguards, he was shot at. One of his guards lost his life,
two others were wounded and the district continued to pillage one lorry
in three to ensure its subsistence.
<p>Attacks on lorries, taking supplies from depots, expropriations from
shops and other forms of pillage, along with social explosions, attacks
on local officials, the expropriation of humanitarian organisations, strikes
and violent demos are still common currency today. There are also small
armed bands all over the place who attack the property of the bourgeoisie
in the region.
<p>For groups of militants defined by internationalism, a period of splits,
of the drawing up of balance sheets, of new convergences, of clarification
etc, began quite a while ago, resulting in a permanent change which is
impossible to summarise. The fusions which gave birth to the Workers' Communist
Party, for example, were made on the basis of important programmatical
rejections by structures or fractions of organisations which, up until
then, had converged and had been incapable of offering a revolutionary
alternative to the imperialist war which was developing between the Kurdish
nationalist fractions: their meeting places emptied and the militants of
these groups dispersed.
<p>Added to the ever greater difficulty of acting publicly, the permanent
insecurity of travel, the breakdown of communications, is the need to draw
a balance sheet and a self-critique of numerous errors. The most interesting
revolutionary nuclei with the most internationalist perspectives have,
in this phase, dedicated the best part of their strength to the formation
and realisation of a balance sheet of struggle, theoretical discussion,
as well assuming the difficult task of maintaining international contacts.
It is clear that this process also conceals dispersion, isolation, discouragement
and disorganisation. Many comrades are trying to leave the region (which
is very difficult because those who have escaped the repressive forces
of the nationalists in Kurdistan are not able to "disappear" in neighbouring
countries: in Turkey and Iran being a "Kurd" is enough to be considered
suspect and subversive by the police) but this has not prevented a handful
of comrades from remaining in contact and ensuring that the ever important
tasks of publishing manifestos and revolutionary tracts against war continue
(especially the group "Proletarian Struggle", ex-"Communist Action Group"
as well as our ICG comrades on the spot). They have managed to make the
theses and positions of our group known in the region, in Kurdish as well
as Arabic, despite all the falsifications and provocations of which we
have been the target (6).
<p>Finally, it is indispensable to insist on the critical situation of
internationalist comrades in the region. Critical because of poverty, the
difficulty in doing any activity, of communicating, of resisting disarmament,
but also because of the difficulty in expressing, counter-current to the
polarisations based on new inter-bourgeois wars, a revolutionary and internationalist
solution.
<p>It is these comrades themselves who <b>call on us to act. We must take
up internationalist action against our own bourgeoisie</b> wherever we
find ourselves. We must put the best of our effort into diffusing <b>this
extraordinary example of the proletariat in Kurdistan, disintegrating an
army, killing soldiers, assassins and torturers</b>. They are so determined
to hide what happened in Iraq in March 1991, <b>because the bourgeoisie
of the whole world trembles with fright at the idea that it could happen
somewhere else</b>.
<p>Our task is to make the revolution develop everywhere so as to prevent
the bourgeoisie from isolating the struggle to one country as they have
in the past, so that quantitatively as well as qualitatively we will go
further, and the proletariat of all countries will fight against its own
bourgeoisie and destroy its strongholds, blow up police stations, open
up the prisons, destroy the army and the police, execute the torturers
and, above all, take <b>the communist revolution in hand</b>, seizing all
power in society, all the means of production <b>to destroy wage labour,
commodities, social classes, the State</b>... and finally, to wipe out
this prison world of poverty, of misery, of war... to constitute a real
WORLD HUMAN COMMUNITY.

<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">Notes</font></u></h3>
1. As we have already made clear on other occasions, "peshmerga" means
fighter, guerilla. Here it is clearly a question of two proletarians enroled
by the nationalist forces who, like a great majority of the peshmergas,
took advantage of the disorganisation of the Ba'athists to come down from
the nearby mountains where they were staying to visit their families.
<p>2. We are once again taking the opportunity to spit in the faces of
all the anti-terrorists and "anti-substitutionists" who are opposed to
the prior arming and indispensable clandestine preparation of the insurrection.
It is they who are <b>to blame</b> for this kind of massacre in our ranks.
The less firepower the insurrection has, the less centralised its direction,
and the more dead, wounded and maimed there will be in its ranks.
<p>3. Only the "red building", doubtless because of the memories it carried,
was not occupied at the time. In the following months it was transformed
into housing for homeless families.
<p>4. This was the wrong way round in our Spanish text. What should have
been attributed to the PUK was attributed to the KDP and vice versa. This
has been corrected in the French translation and in this one.
<p>5. This continues to be the case with Saddam and the Ba'athists.
<p>6. Tracts have been distributed and positions expressed on the radio
and on television in the name of the Internationalist Communist Group,
pretending that we support some party in the elections or some position
in favour of national self-determination. All these positions are in <b>complete
antagonism</b> with our programmatical theses, leaving no doubt that these
accusations aim to spread doubt and confusion. Our comrades have information
indicating that, in some cases, important nationalist figures, direct enemies
(programmatic and personal) of internationalist militants, were directly
involved in spreading these falsifications.

As history shows us, the more the bourgeoisie speaks of peace, the more
important the competition to which they abandon themselves to drown any
revolutionary uprisings in blood. It is this very scenario that the bourgeoisie
applied when faced with the proletarian forces coming out of the uprisings
of March 1991 in Iraq. Despite having suffered a few vicious setbacks since
then, the proletariat is still managing locally to mark out a continuity
in its refusal to submit to the State. This situation of permanent resistance
constitutes an important factor in the destabilisation of the social order
which makes the difficulties of capitalist restructuring more and more
intolerable, not only on the regional level but also for the whole of the
world State.
<p>Since then, the State has been rushing to launch all its forces (UN,
KDP, PUK, Islamists) on the proletariat and its struggles, profiting from
the lack of organisation of our class. This offensive has taken the form
of:
<p>Proletarians being disarmed of any tools of combat - their guns as well
as their class organisation. In parallel with this the State has reinforced
the presence of all the institutions indispensable for the maintenance
of social peace (nationalist police, new bourgeois parties...) to defend
its order, its national economy and its society.
<p>The material preparation necessary for sending proletarians back to
work. Merely re-opening factories was not enough, it was also necessary
to put proletarians in a situation of deplorable poverty, of famine for
them to finally accept a return to work, so as to be exploited even more
than before and to have to give their blood for the national economy.
<p>The submission of proletarians to the spirit of sacrifice, to the safeguard
of the nation and property, to respect for the laws and institutions for
the maintenance of social peace (from the family and the mosque to the
army and parliament), that is to say to the needs of capitalist production.
<p>That said, this offensive to reestablish order with the aid of the various
bourgeois fractions has run into a thousand and one phenomena of working
class resistance which still prevent these fractions from being able to
guarantee a long-lasting social peace sufficient for proletarians to return
passively to work and to allow capitalists to reinvest in the region.

<p>Although the struggles preceding the insurrections of March 1991 aimed
at globally confronting all the forces of the State (the Ba'ath party,
the nationalists, the other opposition parties) it remains true that the
movement contained numerous expressions limiting these attacks to the perspective
of a society free of Ba'athists. This political limit of opposition to
a form of government, which was present in the movement, put a brake on
the social action against the whole of the conditions of life, against
the whole of capitalist social relations: wage labour, prisons and so on.
<p>Another fact: neither the parties nor the nationalist forces had an
important role, neither militarily or politically, at the heart of the
social conflicts. Their armed regiments consisted of not more than a few
hundred people.
<p>Subsequently, the waves of uprisings against the miserable living conditions
in the North and the South of Iraq, the repression and the huge massacres
during the war years by the Ba'athist government, the new international
political conditions created by the Gulf War (including the condemnation
of the Ba'athist regime by the "international community" of bourgeois States),
all created a favourable terrain for the strong resurgence of fractions
of the bourgeoisie opposed to the existing regime.
<p>Until then, even if the revolutionary uprisings had occasionally been
brought into confrontation with the parties and forces of the opposition,
they nevertheless acted generally outside their influence and without these
forces having to reveal their counter-revolutionary role too clearly. The
revolutionary uprisings were genuinely autonomous and had clearly ruptured
from the parties and the forces of the opposition, even if, in some places,
there was a certain political and ideological influence of nationalism
and democracy. But certain anti-Ba'athist limitations in the movement allowed
the forces of the bourgeois opposition to partially infiltrate it. Thus,
although they manifested considerable class ruptures, the shoras and other
associations set up by the proletariat at this time also contained important
limits to the rupture with democracy.
<p>It is precisely from the moment that the movement organised itself in
the form of shoras, in the form of mass associations, that the parties
of the counter-revolution were able to assert their presence and elaborate
their democratic-nationalist-populist ideology. These are therefore the
limits of a sort of anti-Ba'athist consensus partially present in the revolutionary
confrontation which allowed the bourgeoisie to crystallise, to set up as
a barrier, the lack of rupture at the heart of the movement.
<p>With the support of the world bourgeoisie and profiting from the condition
of isolation of the struggle of proletarians in the region, the counter-revolution,
personified by the nationalist organisations and opponents of the regime,
is today bringing its corpses back to life. It is trying to take control
of events and to progressively force a transformation of the general direction
of the movement towards a war of liberation of the Kurds and Kurdistan,
that is to say a war linked to the interests of the counter-revolution.
In looking to disperse and atomise the proletariat war, the nationalists
are not failing in their tasks, they are only trying to realise the goal
fixed by their historic identity.
<center>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">oOo</font></h2></center>
Proletarians set up barricades in most of the towns of the North and South
of Iraq, they confronted the Iraqi army and police force with guns in their
hands and wiped out the "Ba'athist" enemy. Faced with this situation there
is not a single living bourgeois whose dirty egotistical desire to enrich
himself did not push him into participating in the massacre of insurgent
proletarians in the region.
<p>It is at that moment that the nationalists, by all sorts of manoeuvres,
chose to place themselves in leading positions facing the forces of the
Ba'athist government. Recuperating the struggle waged by the proletariat,
they hung on to that position which guaranteed them the "legitimacy" of
renegotiating, hand in hand with the Ba'athist authorities, the division
of tasks necessary for maintaining order and capitalist society.
<p>The "victories" of proletarians having, at the time, been essentially
military, it was easy for the nationalists to limit them to that aspect,
wiping out the social dimension of the movement. This dimension has played
an important role in the transformation of the class content of the uprisings:
the liberator once again taking on the image of the Peshmerga, at least
in the North of Iraq. Even if Peshmerga are not officially designated as
a bourgeois force, this denomination nevertheless refers in public opinion
to the particular institution which is the army of liberation of the Kurdish
nation. In the present period this represents the nationalists of the PUK
and the KDP. These have played the card of confusion to the full by denoting
real nationless and internationalist proletarian martyrs as <i>"Peshmerga
who died on such or such a patriotic front"</i>.
<p>This was particularly marked in Kirkuk during the attack which aimed
to liberate the town. Hundreds of fallen proletarians were identified by
the nationalists as being "martyrs" from such and such a bourgeois force
while they were in fact its irreducible enemies. The official history thus
gulps down the blood of the proletariat so as to create a list of <i>"those
who died for the fatherland"</i>. Each time, the presence of such and such
nationalist contingent was sufficient to justify this recuperation while,
as always, it was the proletarian insurgents who constituted the <i>avant-garde</i>
of the fighting and not the nationalists.
<p>This recuperation was doubled in a manoeuvre in which the nationalists
set about dispersing the movement so as to better drag it in their wake.
At the time when proletarians had just started to act against the State
in the early stages of the uprising, the nationalists of the PUK and the
KDP tried by every means to frighten and intimidate the populations of
the insurgent towns, notably by the threat of an army counter-offensive
and of a so-called government plan to massacre the Kurds by chemical bombing.
They thus managed to push the majority of the population (including a large
section of the families of proletarians who had taken an active part in
the March insurrection) to leave their homes and head for the Iranian or
Turkish borders. Those who managed to get to these safe places - many died
from cold and hunger along the route of the exodus - found the forces of
the UN and various States waiting to disarm them and put them in camps.
At that stage the movement had lost a lot of political, social and also
military potential: many of the combat positions gained during the struggles
of the months of March, April and May had fallen into the hands of the
coalition formed by the nationalists and the other parties of opposition
to the Ba'athist government. At the same time the <i>avant-garde</i> which
had wanted to remain in place was isolated and dissolved. During this time,
all the bourgeois forces negotiated their part in the control of the region.
Having profited from the exodus by pillaging houses, taking back the equipment
and arms reappropriated by the insurgent proletarians, the nationalist
chiefs had invited proletarians to return to their emptied houses!
<p>They thought they were on favourable ground and started to put their
bourgeois plans and projects into action: negotiations with central government
(the Kurdish Front all-party Front), preparation of free and democratic
elections, the establishment of autonomous Kurdish rule under the protection
of worldwide capitalist States. The prisons were reinforced for those who
failed to respect their law and order and torture and executions of "traitors"
were organised everywhere.
<p>Now that the armed forces of the Ba'athist central government had been
liquidated, the task of imposing order in the North of Iraq fell quite
naturally on them as historic members of the bourgeois opposition capable
of dismantling the proletarian movement. In order to undertake the destruction
of the proletarian movement, the nationalists had to, above all, build
a new government which would ensure normal production and circulation of
goods and guarantee the functioning of State institutions. For the nationalists
this entailed rapidly reassuring the worldwide State regarding the efficacy
of its work of social pacification of the proletariat. They proved irreproachable
in their undertaking of this task! We are convinced that for this kind
of mission, today's State does not have more faithful and effective servants.
<p>Preoccupied by the constitution of their government and their nation,
the Kurdish nationalist forces effectively tried everything to achieve
a certain social stability, well aware that their existence, as that of
any nation, is indissociably linked with putting proletarians to work and
to efficient running of production. They knew very well that their existence,
as new local managers of capitalist exploitation was directly linked to
their victory in this domain.
<p>If they are coming across some difficulties today, it is not because
they are "managing things badly" as many opponents of the "critical support"
school would have it, but because a large section of proletarians refuse
to make solidarity with their government, its programme and its projects.
These proletarians, which the nationalists insist on calling "citizens"
know very well that their interests are diametrically opposed to those
of the Kurdish patriots. They are aware that becoming "citizens" means
submitting themselves to the will of their enemies, who thus enrich themselves
and reinforce their power to their detriment.

Today, the proletariat in the North of Iraq is showing real difficulties
in clearly dissociating its interests from those of the bourgeoisie and
in asserting itself as an entirely autonomous class. Nevertheless, there
is a generalised lack of trust in the nationalist forces and parties in
Kurdistan.
<p>It is important to remember that in this area there have always been
extremely combative proletarian factions, organised at different levels,
which have risen up in various periods of struggle to assume the revolutionary
tasks of our class. This historical continuity of struggle in the region
explains the lack of confidence in the nationalist proposals.
<p>In this sense, one of the essential tasks of the bourgeoisie to stabilise
order in the region is to disarm proletarians. The nationalists have had
great difficulties in imposing this, especially given the ever-present
fear that Saddam's armies could return. Proletarians are thus disarmed
by militarising them into rival bourgeois camps. It is not a question here
of physically taking their arms away from them, but of dissolving the force
of the proletariat (the struggle to abolish all exploitation) in a confrontation
with no future other than the eventual victory of one or other nationalist
fraction which will have won the monopoly on the exploitation and repression
of proletarians. Incapable of calmly and massively integrating the workers
into the factories of the capitalist relaunch, the nationalists have turned
their armies into factories filled with proletarians in peshmerga clothes
who kill each other in rival bourgeois confrontations.
<p>At this level, the proletariat has suffered its heaviest defeat since
1991. Having attacked the bourgeoisie head-on, aiming their guns at the
Ba'athists and other bourgeois fractions, today proletarians find themselves
placed as enemies of their own class brothers instead of assuming the continuity
of the struggle of class against class by attacking the various elements
of the Kurdish Front which today ensure the leadership of the State.
<p>This reality confirms the crucial role played by the nationalists in
the current reinforcement of the State in Iraq. In the division of labour
amongst different bourgeois fractions, currently they are the best suited
to dissolve the proletariat and to turn it into cannon fodder.

The emergence and reinforcement of Islamic forces in a region in which
Islam had never really had a hold is the product of the same conditions
described above. Their growing influence came about by their advantage
of not having revealed their role in the heat of events, as did the other
nationalist parties. Moreover, to understand the development of their numbers,
it is necessary to take into account that these organisations are financially
supported by various agents of world Capital in order to openly confront
communism.
<p>The Islamic movements in Iraq, as in other countries in the region,
take advantage of a situation in which discontent and struggle against
imposed living conditions affect a large number of proletarians and where,
paradoxically, organisation and class unity are still weak. They take advantage
of a situation in which the majority of proletarians have lost all illusions
about the policies of the traditional bourgeois forces. How to trust parties
who for decades, in the name of one or other democratic policy, in the
name of national liberation or socialism, have touted charitable projects
and promises which they are incapable of keeping and which always conclude
in a blood bath?
<p>For a long time social-democrats and other Leninists have been able
to impose their capitalist programme in the name of a better world (1);
today, in a period in which communism is still facing enormous difficulties
in imposing itself as a perspective, it is the Islamists who, although
they have no difference in nature from their atheist bourgeois colleagues,
brandish their programme in the name of humanity. Their celestial pseudo-alternative
appears just as radical for the fact that it is not based on national and
immediate reform, but on a far more universal perspective.
<p>In addition to these socio-political factors, Islamists dispose of that
particular weapon that is the religious weapon, a weapon different to all
others because in the context of an after-life to which there is only access
after death, it is not necessary for them to propose solutions for the
real and present world. Allah will sort everything out up there! Religious
ideology thus plays a particularly effective role for the bourgeoisie,
to the extent that they even lie about the existence of their after-life,
as they make no promises to reform and improve the world down here, sparing
them any criticism of not keeping to their word. Their political decisions,
their religious consultations, their "Fatwa", come from their material
and earthly beings, but they present them as being orders from God, which
gives them the hope that they will not have to account for their criminal
acts. They craftily plead that <i>"We will all be returned to God and it
is He who will judge"</i>! But it is jumping the gun a bit to imagine they
can keep the benefits of these arguments to hide their anti-proletarian
nature for long.
<p>Moreover, Iran is not far away and the consequences of the experience
of the Islamist government in Iran, result of repression of the revolutionary
movement there, are well-known. What the Islamist forces did there in the
name of liberating human beings from capitalist civilisation, leaves them
no cause to be jealous of what other bourgeois have realised throughout
history. Reality has clearly shown that, in other terms, the Islamist forces
are there to assume the same function as all other bourgeois fractions
that have gone before them: to exploit proletarians and ensure the order
and stability of Capital's mode of production.
<p>Repeated uprisings by proletarians in Iranian towns and villages concretely
reflect this decredibilisation of Islam and indicate that the days of these
bands of bigots are well and truly numbered. When proletarians do attack
the Islamist government, they will not content themselves with attacking
the ruling government alone, but will fight Islam in all its forms.
<p>The geographical proximity of Iran and the closeness in time of what
happened around the Shah's downfall actually reduces the Islamists' room
for manoeuvre in Iraq. Nor do they have the benefit of the image of uprightness
and honesty that Khomeini enjoyed compared to the Shah: They have already
been denounced
<p>by many proletarians as religious men whose faith is directly inspired
by whatever will fit into their wallets.
<p>What differentiates the situation in Iraq from the rest of the world
is that over the past few years, as in a few other countries, proletarians
have shown an important level of struggle that is principally characterised
by the continuity with which the proletariat confronts the State, a continuity
which dates back to before the "Iran-Iraq" war and which, despite a ferocious
repression throughout the years, cannot be quelled.

At another level, it is clear that the capacity of the nationalists to
recruit proletarians under their flags as well as the appearance of a new
Islamist fraction equally expresses the difficulties experienced by the
proletariat in openly defining its needs and fully reappropriating its
social project of subversion of the old world.
<p>The proletariat's lack of unity and weakness of class organisation allows
the bourgeois to engage in any necessary battles to retake control of the
situation and to know to whom the exploitation of proletarians will be
granted next. The proletariat will live these inter-fractional wars for
as long as it fails to strangle the whole of the forces aiming to keep
capitalism in place, for as long as it fails to take its revolutionary
project firmly in its own hands, for as long as it fails to openly claim
the leadership of its movement by organising itself as a class, a force
and thus as a party.
<p>It was directly against the unification of the proletarian movement
in the North and the South that the State divided the country into three
zones. It is only by fighting against these geographical divisions that
the proletariat will be able to reappropriate its own struggle, by retracing
the class frontier to where it really is: between its own interests and
those of Capital. The pursuit of proletarian struggle today has its stakes
in recognition of the State within the whole of bourgeois fractions and
forces, whatever the region, and to denounce each one, without exception,
as enemies.

<td><font face="Comic Sans MS">During the March 1991 uprising, thousands
of "Arab" deserters had refused to shoot at the rebels and at the local
population and showed solidarity and a will to participate in the movement.
Many of them had called for the rebels to come and take whatever weapons
and other military equipment they needed from their barracks. Amongst these
soldiers, some went directly over to the side of the movement and some
were killed in battles side by side with other "Kurdish" rebel proletarians.
Taking advantage of the weaknesses of the proletariat, in particular the
lack of organisation and centralisation of activity, the nationalists were
able to separate these "Arab" soldiers from the rest of the movement and
capture them as prisoners of war. They handed these "prisoners" over to
the Ba'athist authorities, as stipulated by the terms of the negotiations.
As soon as it laid its hands on these soldiers the Iraqi Army began to
execute hundreds of the most active. They sent their bodies back to their
families with a letter: <i>"This is what the savage Kurds have done to
our son!"</i> In this way the bourgeois fed hatred amongst proletarians:
Kurds against Arabs, Islamists against non-Islamists, blacks against whites...
The nationalists did the same thing on their side. Every time they killed
or massacred "Kurdish proletarians" they said it was the work of the Arabs!</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">As the nationalists did not have any way,
nor the force, to prevent proletarians from taking revenge by attacking
the headquarters of Ba'athist organisations (police, party, secret service,
prisons...) They tried to save - when they could - the high level officers
and generals of the army, especially the Kurdish Ba'athist police and those
in charge. Currently they play important roles in their ranks.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Clearly, in their negotiations, the nationalists
placed all the responsibility for the massacre on the rebel proletarians,
<i>"savages
without rules nor any respect for any order"</i>, including the responsibility
for the massacre that they themselves carried out on the soldiers and militants
with a Ba'athist base (the ones who had been forced to carry the party
card for one reason or another, often because of work!).</font></td>

Continuation of the struggle in Iraq must equally entail putting forward
the communist project: universal liberation of the human race from the
State, from social classes, from money...in a word, the abolition of capitalist
exploitation.
<p>Assuming this perspective in Iraq today means:
<ul>
<li>
Having a position outside and against all political and military forces
of the State and its Kurdish government.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
Refusing to make sacrifices. Struggling against the miserable living conditions
imposed on us. Denouncing the manoeuvres by bourgeois parties to channel
our dissatisfaction to integrate it into their society of citizens - good
to produce and to die.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
Organising direct action and class mobilisation to free our militants from
prison.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
Establishing and reinforcing links for struggle with the whole of our class
throughout the world.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
Fighting against all divisions used by the capitalist world (worker/unemployed,
man/woman, manual worker/intellectual, worker/peasant, Kurd/Arab, black/white...).
Showing through activity of subversion of the old world that the proletariat
does not belong to any race, any religion, any people and that this ideological
fragmentation merely aims to dissolve the proletariat into the crowd of
national citizens devoid of class belonging.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
Fighting all forces locking the nature of proletarians up in work and exploitation.</li>
</ul>
In the present context in Iraq, it is indispensable to organise the action
of the whole of the expressions of existing struggles (shoras, district
revolutionary committees, groups of self-defence and class direct action...)
and to encourage these practices to find their natural extension in the
struggle of our brothers in other countries of the region (Iran, Turkey,...).
Only the centralisation and generalisation of these struggles will allow
the affirmation of a single class, a single movement organically soldered
to the communist and internationalist social project. This consolidation
of our struggle will pass through the struggle against nationalists and
the Nation, Islamists and religion, against humanists and pacifists, against
every kind of reformist.

1. The "workers communist parties" in Iraq and Iran are living examples
of classical Leninist organisations which put out radical slogans of proletarian
revolution against the bourgeoisie but which, in practice, call for proletarians
to defend the democratic rights and liberties of the exploited "people"...
Although some militants from these organisations have been executed under
the regime of these same democratic rights and liberties and some are still
in the prisons of democracy, these organisations still call for more democracy!
The programme of these organisations is limited to the democratic struggle
for a "workers'" power which would manage the society (of wage labour)
in an egalitarian manner and would give freedom to its citizens and to
all political forces in the society (sic!) to enjoy the right (of property!).
This is how the so-called communists follow the path of emancipation of
proletarians: work for the workers... ownership of production for themselves!
What they propose is Capital "with a workers' management", or rather a
capitalist management in the name of the power of the proletariat.
