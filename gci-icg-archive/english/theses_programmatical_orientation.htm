<h2>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">Introduction</font></u></h2>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">These programmatical theses constitute a document
on which our group has been working for many years, even before the "official"
birth of ICG in June 1979. They represent a synthesis of work on a permanent
level of international discussion, criticism, increasing depth and elaboration,
realised historically by revolutionary militants. It is this activity which
permits an ever more precise delimitation of the programmatical theses
of our movement, communism (1).</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">On this question, as on all others, we totally
and simultaneously reject the ideology of formal invariance (the orthodoxy
of form) as well as that of all kinds of revisionist innovators (the heterodoxy
of content). As our theses indicate, we oppose them with a constantly deepening
and ever more precise determination of the programmatical implications
invariably contained in the communist struggle.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">This is why these theses are neither the
umpteenth version of some sacred text nor a conglomeration of ideas susceptible
to being changed, in total or in part, according to the will of some or
other militants (even if in the majority). They are rather an expression,
a "snapshot" of a moment of permanent collective activity of programmatical
restoration, of which there were formulations in the past and certainly
will be in the future, but which are all present on the historical line
seeking to express theoretically the communist practice of rupture from
the whole capitalist society.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">As far as this eminently practical theoretical
activity is concerned, the work of communist factions is always the same:
To perceive and express, against all ideologies, what in the immediate
reality announces the historical future, what within and against capitalism
constitutes its negation and announces communism, to
<u>synthesize</u>
the experience accumulated in the development of revolution and counterrevolution.
It is concerned with an indispensable part of <u>communist action</u>,
not only in the sense that communist factions constitute a part of and
a <u>coherent organic expression</u> of the movement of destruction of
the present society, but also because it is through them that <u>the proletariat</u>
condenses its experiences and transforms them into <u>directives</u> for
future action or, better said, <u>COMMUNISM THUS ENGENDERS ITS HISTORICAL
DIRECTION</u> (2).</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">So for us the problem is neither to invent
"new theories" (which always implies repeating the same old crap in a new
form) nor to discover new "historical subjects", nor to promote "new practices".
On the contrary, we have to continue to demonstrate the invariable consequences
of the contradiction between capitalism and communism, present ever since
Capital conquered production and subsumed the whole of humanity in its
being.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">The advantage of such a document is that
it allows us to set out in a very synthesized and global manner the whole
of the fundamental positions that direct our activity and it can serve
as an explicit reference of the programmatical framework within which our
militancy develops. At the same time this kind of text has the disadvantage
of being easily considered by fetishists of form as being an A to Z of
revolutionary theory, who consider that, once formulated, it would be able
to solve all the problems with which the communist movement will be confronted,
however embryonic and dispersed it may be today. On our part, we consider
these theses to be an acquired base, the result of several years of militant
activity and which will serve to direct and demarcate our future militancy.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">The theses of communists are not and never
have been "theorizations" about how the world should be reformed, inventions
or ideological nonsense. On the contrary, they are the theoretical expression
of the real movement of abolition of the existing order. As such, they
synthesize the real and practical determinations of the proletariat in
its subversive movement, forming at the same time a decisive and indispensable
part in the practice of this movement in its struggle to give itself a
revolutionary direction and to constitute itself as a worldwide historical
force.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Throughout the centuries-old history of the
Communist Party, the theses of communists have been asserted, developed
themselves and become more and more precise along with the very development
of the revolutionary movement (including the lessons learnt from its successive
defeats). However, this does not mean that the successive formulations
of these theses can be left to be freely interpreted nor that they lend
themselves to any of many boasting innovations. As theoretical expressions
of the invariant antagonism between capitalism and communism, these successive
formulations are necessarily imperfect and unfinished. We can assert that
all formal manifestos produced throughout the history of the party and
up to the total victory of communist revolution contain and will continue
to contain various erroneous positions or even positions alien to the interests
of the proletariat. Nevertheless, each one of these successive formulations,
insofar as they are real concretisations of the communist direction of
the movement, reaffirms - on a different level of abstraction - the invariant
foundations of this movement. This is why each generation of revolutionaries
does not start again from scratch but, on the contrary, its practical activity
is directed by invariant foundations that must not be revised, but must
be developed and pushed forward to their ultimate consequences.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">In opposition to this revolutionary activity,
counter-revolution, especially social-democracy as the general party of
formal pseudo-continuity and real programmatical revision, does exactly
the opposite. Even when it claims it is the heir to proletarian leaders
from the past, it uses only isolated quotes, taken out of context in the
name of formal orthodoxy, yet always attacks the very foundations of the
invariant antagonism. The whole revisionist production is based on a general
reinterpretation of capitalism, on a supposed change in the nature of capitalism
and consequently of the proletarian struggle in order to define its invariant
counter-revolutionary programme.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">It seems indispensable here to give an example
of what we've just stated which will clarify the reading and general meaning
of our theses.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><b>"THE PROLETARIAT HAS NO HOMELAND"</b>
is a central and invariant thesis of our party all along its history. It
contains and determines a whole series of fundamental practical orientations.
But what is the origin of this assertion and what are its implications?
Contrary to what bourgeois <u>Marxism</u> pretends, this decisive thesis
is not the invention of some brilliant theoretician, but expresses the
reality, the very life of the proletariat.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">In this way, in the first Manifesto of the
Communist Party (deserving of this name, in the full sense of the word)
Marx and Engels formulated a reality that up until then, in different forms,
had been part of this ABC of the communist movement and which all subsequent
formulations of the Programme have taken up since.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">But the reality of the proletariat having
no homeland is not a contingent reality, nor a reality that can be given
dates of a beginning or an end, nor should it be confused with its first
theoretical formulation. It is, on the contrary, an <b><u>essential and
permanent</u></b> reality of the proletariat as an historical being, determining
it in opposition to the whole bourgeois system. As the
<b><u>negation</u></b>
of this bourgeois society, it contains <b><u>decisive definitions of the
society to come</u></b> (the abolition of all nationality, of all borders,
etc.).</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Put differently, before Marx and Engels ever
formulated it, this invariant reality of the communist movement in opposition
to any country was already a reality: the proletariat never had and never
will have a homeland. Its own existence contains the abolition of all nationality
(3).</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">So we shouldn't be surprised that other more
or less clear expressions of this central aspect of the communist programme
have also been formulated in other parts of the world, before or after
this Manifesto, by other communist militants who didn't even know about
Marx or Engels - because they are merely expressions of the life and practice
of our class.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">The theoretical assertion of this extremely
explicit thesis in the Manifesto, marks a <b><u>decisive and irreversible</u></b>
forward step of the party itself. It became an essential basis for all
subsequent formulations from which there is no going back and it constituted
itself as a war cry for the proletariat in struggle.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">This is not the place to detail the progression
that led militants like Marx and Engels to formulate this thesis. But it
is important to stress that this thesis is not only a <b><u>negation</u></b>
in its form, but also in its content, inasmuch as the real movement of
the proletariat <b><u>is</u></b> the negation of the homeland - essential
in order to understand the methodology of the theses that we are presenting
below.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">The general method of the exposition - the
opposition communism/capitalism and, during capitalism, communism as its
practical negation - is founded on the fact that all positive programmatical
determinations are contained negatively within Capital itself (including
counter-revolutionary experiences). Better said, under the reign of capitalism,
<b><u>communism,
as the revolutionary movement</u></b>, is this negation.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">It is not possible to go through all the
theses that are indissociably linked to the central assertion that "the
proletariat has no homeland", nor can we mention all the conclusions and
implications that Marx and Engels deduced from it. However, we want to
stress that it is based on a certain level of perception of Capital as
a worldwide reality, of communism as a universal movement and of internationalism
as a decisive element in the practice of the proletariat. Without these
invariant bases, the cry of "Proletarians of all countries, unite", as
well as the directly internationalist conception of the party and of the
programme (the Manifesto itself does not have a homeland!!!) would have
been no more than empty phrases. What is decisive in the historical line
of the party is the continuity from generation to generation of revolutionaries,
which is not about inventing or revising anything but developing in their
own revolutionary practice the determinations contained within the real
subversive existing movement.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Revisionism does exactly the opposite. It
may or may not use quotations from Marx or Engels or any other revolutionary
leader, but its <u>invariant</u> characteristic will always be to question
the very foundations of the practical determinations of the proletariat.
For this purpose, it will always, absolutely always, start by saying that
the society has changed, that capitalism is not the same as before, that
the workers' struggle has changed as well... and then it ends up defending
anything, even the homeland. On this question, let's look at what Bernstein
wrote:</font>
<p><i><font face="Comic Sans MS">"But has social democracy, as the party
of the working class and peace, an interest in keeping the proletariat
defensive of the nation? There are various reasons which would push one
towards a negative response, above all if one takes as the starting point
the assertion of the Communist Manifesto: The proletariat has no homeland.
Yet this assertion may be a lot more valid for the workers in the forties
(4) who lacked political rights and access to public life; but currently
it has already lost a great deal of its veracity... and will continue to
lose it more and more as the worker ceases to be a proletarian and is transformed
into a citizen.</font></i>
<p><i><font face="Comic Sans MS">The worker who, in the state, in the municipalities...
is an elector having the same rights and participating for the common good
of the nation; the worker whose children are educated and whose health
is protected by the community, in the same way that it guarantees him security
against misfortunes... this worker will before long have a fatherland by
the very fact of being a citizen of the world; in the same way that nations
become closer together without losing their own individuality...</font></i>
<p><i><font face="Comic Sans MS">Currently there is a lot of talk about
the conquest of political power by social democracy and in any case, judging
by the strength which it has achieved in Germany, it is not impossible
that a series of political events could lead it in a short period of time
to assume a decisive role in this country. But precisely because of such
an eventuality and taking into account the distance which separates the
neighbouring peoples from this objective, social democracy must assume
a national character...</font></i>
<p><i><font face="Comic Sans MS">This is an indispensable condition for
maintaining its power. It must prove its aptitude as the ruling party and
a ruling class, in being up to the task of safeguarding, with the same
firmness, class interests and the interests of the nation."</font></i>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Bernstein, The Premises of Socialism and
the Tasks of Social Democracy, Ch. IV, Texts and Possibilities of Social
Democracy.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">There is no need for us to stress any further
the very clear political consequences of such a methodology of revision.
However, in general, things are far more complicated. Indeed, Marx and
Engels themselves did not draw all the inferences from this essential thesis
of the communist programme, in the same way, for example, that the generation
of revolutionaries of 1917 did not manage to assume the implications of
other central theses of the programme, such as "destruction of the bourgeois
state" or "abolition of wage labour", etc. On the basis of an un-finished
reappropriation of this reality of the proletariat "that has no homeland",
Marx and Engels oscillated between different positions on the national
question, defended some totally contradictory positions, many times directly
antagonistic to proletarian internationalism. The ambiguities of Marx and
Engels on social-democracy (the very basis of the constitution of which
was antagonistic to this thesis, ie. national parties for the defence of
democracy!!!) were also related to this only partial programmatical reappropriation;
and so was the fact that Engels completely revised this central thesis
to demand German national defence and participation in imperialist war.
Indeed, between the thesis that asserts that "the proletariat has no homeland"
with its immediate consequences (internationalism, directly international
organisation of the proletariat, opposition to the nationalism of one's
"own" bourgeoisie, consequences which all arise from the very life of the
proletariat fighting against its direct exploiters and thus develop an
internationalist practice) and Engels' nationalist, bourgeois, imperialist
position of 1891, when the outbreak of war between the German state and
the Russian and French states appeared imminent, there lies an abyss, a
very profound <b><u>programmatical rupture, a complete revision</u></b>.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Remember that Engels stated that if Germany
were attacked "all means of defence would be good; we would have to launch
attacks on the Russians and their allies, whoever they may be" and he even
suggested that in those circumstances "we might perhaps be the sole truly
warmongering and determined party"! (5) As is well-known, this is exactly
the pro-imperialist position that social-democracy went on to develop.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">This example allows us to show clearly why
counter-revolution and revisionism could, and still can, in many cases,
play at orthodoxy (the general practice of the "Marxist" wing of social-democracy
whose great ideologue was Kautsky) either because Marx and Engels themselves
developed the implications of this thesis only halfway, or because Engels
himself revised this thesis completely, under the pretext - as always -
of particular conditions of capitalism at that moment.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">To this, we oppose the historical attitude
of communists. For us, it is not a matter of modifying this central thesis,
nor putting it on the same level as a whole of contingent and confused
sentences that go along with it (like stating that the struggle of the
proletariat will be international only in its contents but not in its form
(6). Neither do we want to follow Marx or Engels throughout their full
or partial renunciations. Without doubt, the issue must be to develop all
the consequences of this thesis. However, such a development is neither
ideological nor invented. It is not a question of sitting at a desk and
trying to invent further clarifications. No, for us it was struggle itself,
the gigantic opposition between revolution and counter-revolution that
clearly marked the frontier between participation in the wars of national
liberation or any other imperialist wars on the one hand and revolutionary
defeatism on the other; this permitted a theoretical and everlasting understanding
of the other implications that Marx and Engels had not yet assumed. Since
then, revolutionary defeatism and internationalism have constituted a truly
appropriated basis, a fundamental starting-point for successive generations
of revolutionaries. <b><u>It is in this manner, through successive programmatical
reappropriation, that the whole of the theses of communism develop and
assert themselves!</u></b></font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">This permits a clarification of the real
contradiction between the invariant programme and the constantly developing
theoretical theses of communists. It is this contradiction that all formalists
(who defend the invariance of the theoretical programme of Marx and Engels),
all revisionists and all "innovators" come up against.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">The proletariat does not have a homeland
and never did have one. In reality, the proletariat acts as such only when
it is struggling against exploitation, against "its" own bourgeois and
against "its" own state. Such practice is part of the true community of
international and internationalist struggle that the communist vanguard
struggles to centralise effectively: this is and always has been a central
axis of communism.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Marx did not invent the communist programme:
he only expressed a level of its appropriation. In the beginning of the
century and all over the world, the communist left did not invent anything
either during its fight against imperialist war, but synthesized, by means
of theses, central slogans and precise directives, the reality of the communist
movement.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Our task is exactly the same. These theses
(7) reflect one further step in the collective, impersonal, international
effort of the communist programme asserting itself generation after generation.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Consequently these theses, that guide and
will guide the conscious and organised activity of our small group, are
not our property (we do not claim their paternity). They are a synthetic
expression of the sum of experiences of our class and of our party throughout
history and, as such, belong to them only.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Different texts have been published in our
central and agitative reviews (in Spanish, French, English, Arabic, Portuguese,
German, Turkish, Hungarian, Kurdish...) that develop and explain these
theses and constitute the basis of the process of their historical appropriation,
which is why we've published a summary of the main texts that have been
published in French and Spanish so far, as an annexe to these theses. It
is important to note that if, on some subjects, the texts are elaborated
in far greater depth than the few lines on that subject in the relevant
thesis this is because, for a large number of them, the task remains embryonic
and an enormous amount remains to be done (this revolutionary task can
only be completely achieved by the very realisation of social revolution).
These theses are not some mythical point of arrival but are working theses,
a synthesis of our practice on the basis of which we continue our activities.
We leave the belief that any text could guarantee against deviations, betrayals,
splits, etc to political paranoiacs. The only guarantee that we have comes
from the globality of our implication, resides in our adhesion not to a
group, to a party or to a leader, but <u>to communism</u>, to the real
movement of abolition of everything that separates us from ourselves. But,
dialectically, this movement only exists when it centralises itself, organises
itself, directs itself, i.e. when it constitutes itself as party.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">The organisation, preparation, structuring
and leadership of this party is the impersonal production of factions,
groups, militants who have forever assumed the task of the international
<b><u>formation</u></b>
of revolutionary cadres and of the preparation of the worldwide leadership
of the communist revolution.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Our central preoccupation, since the formation
of the ICG, has been and is to assume, according to our limited forces
and the present state of the communist movement, all the tasks and necessities
of the movement. What characterizes communists practically is <b>not</b>
their assuming one or other task according to the period, as the only one
that can be realised (tasks which for some may be "theoretical", for others
"propagandist" and for others "military"). If this were the case, then
communists would differentiate themselves from the rest of the proletariat
by entirely partial determinations, taking on a number of minor tasks compared
to the rest of the proletarian movement.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">On the contrary, the essence of revolutionary
praxis is to assume
<u>all</u> tasks and necessities of the movement whilst,
of course, taking into account the balance of forces and the priorities
that it determines. All these tasks must be assumed while always putting
forward the historical and worldwide interests of the movement; these determine
themselves not in relation to immediate or contingent situations, but always
in relation to the totality, to communism. This and only this, is the historical
line of the reconstitution of the <b><u>PARTY</u></b>.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">If the written expressions of life and of
the struggle have always been criticised by militants (a logical expression
of the dynamics of life regarding things that are set in writing and thus
fixed), we must also remember that language itself is a veil produced by
the domination of Capital, through which it is extremely difficult to communicate
any content escaping this domination: the same contradiction is ever-present
when we express a movement through language that only allows for set categories.
Similarly, a concept may express a different content in different languages,
according to different realities lived by the proletariat.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">To fill these gaps and to lessen the burden
of these weaknesses which we know are unavoidable, we have tried to work
on these theses in four different languages so as to unify the expressions
of the reality we want to transmit. The result of this is a rather "impure"
and "heavy" language. On top of this, the content of concepts that have
been historically and socially defined does not have the same meaning for
us as for the citizen, not even the most politicised amongst them. This
is the case, for instance, for expressions like "party", "proletariat",
"class", "democracy", "Capital"; on these points it is necessary to take
the contributions that we've produced on these various subjects as a reference.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">The translation of our main contributions
into different languages, reflects this effort for centralisation and homogenization
in our central reviews. To stress this tendency towards homogenization,
and because we feel it is more appropriate, we've decided to call all our
central reviews "Communism" (our French central review used to be called
"The Communist"). With respect to continuity between our publications the
following statement by Bordiga in 1953 is clear enough:</font>
<p><i><font face="Comic Sans MS">"To follow the continuity of our contributions,
our readers should not feel bothered by the changes of the titles of our
reviews, changes that occur because of different episodes of minor events.
Our contributions can easily be recognised through their indivisible organicity.
It is typical of the bourgeois to put a label on each commodity produced,
to put the name of an intellectual on each idea, to define each party through
its leader... but on the proletarian side it is clear that when the mode
of exposition examines the objective relationship of reality, this can
never be reduced to the personal opinions of stupid competitors, to the
praise or insults for heavyweights or featherweights. In this case, the
judgment is not defined by contents but by the good or bad faith of the
person who's pleading. Our task is hard and difficult but it will only
achieve its aims while respecting its own nature and without using the
artifices of bourgeois publicity techniques, without using the dirty tendency
to worship men."</font></i>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">("<u>Fil du Temps</u>" - 1953)</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">This is why our "Programmatical Theses" are
not some "platform" in the reduced, conformist and showy sense in which
various sects define themselves as the centre of the earth. The communist
programme is not a biblical text guaranteeing against all possible deviations,
a tablet of stone to cling to in order to safeguard virginal purity. In
this way the term platform has been mystified with the intention of making
it pass for a synonym of communist programme (as if it were possible to
reduce the communist programme to any text, whichever it was!). Counter-revolution
claims such a platform will be a formal guarantee for the future. Moreover,
pretension of pretensions, it also claims that it contains the answers
to all questions raised by proletarian struggles. It was against such fetishism
of "platforms", of "programmes", that Marx asserted, more than a century
ago, that one forward step of the real movement was worth more than a dozen
programmes.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">To all fetishists of platforms and of ideal
parties, to all militants of formalistic invariance who believe they will
not deviate an inch because they trot out a platform or recite phrases
by some or other proletarian leader, we can easily recall their readiness
to adopt new phrases, new platforms, a new group, new practices and to
insult their former comrades... Finally, to all those who hide their miserable
individualism, their sectarianism and federalism behind fine words on the
ideal "party" or the perfection of "revolutionary cadres", basing themselves
on quotations of the leaders of the past, we counter them with something
we wrote some time ago in our central French review (Intro, "Le Communiste"
No.6):</font>
<p><i><font face="Comic Sans MS">"For us communists, what really matters
is not some or other quotation from Marx, Lenin or Bordiga, nor some or
other position taken up at a certain moment. What really matters is to
grasp the invariant <b><u>content</u></b>, beyond its more or less clear
expressions, to grasp the red thread linking the communist practice of
always, <b><u>to be on the side of the proletarian struggle against all
capitalist barriers</u></b>. Beyond the understanding at a particular moment,
beyond formal expressions, beyond consciousness expressed by proletarian
banners or texts the real immediate struggle of the working class against
exploitation, has always been - yesterday, today and tomorrow - <b><u>anti-frontist,
antidemocratic, anti-national</u></b>."</font></i>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Our enemy, the capitalist social relationship
personified by the bourgeois class, has always been the same. Our necessities
and demands will also always be the same: the struggle against exploitation,
against the intensity and extension of labour... Our methods of struggle,
direct action (revolutionary violence and terrorism), organisation outside
and against all structures of the bourgeois state, armed insurrection,
the worldwide dictatorship of the proletariat for the abolition of wage
labour... have always been the same. It is to this <b><u>real invariance</u></b>,
to this real organic continuity between the communist factions of yesterday
and today, that we want to contribute by means of these programmatical
theses.</font>

<h3>
<u><font face="Comic Sans MS">Notes</font></u></h3>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">1. We have to mention here that we are applying
this general statement, above all, to ourselves and to the task of writing
these theses. Thus, this difficult international collective work that we
continue and will continue to assume has permitted, within our small group,
the international centralisation of polemics and the crystallization of
a whole of decisive divergences which, on several occasions, ended in resignations,
exclusions, etc. Despite the sometimes virulent polemics and internal/public
confrontations between various positions, the centralisation of these polemics
by way of a whole of internal international structures, has permitted not
only a programmatical advance for our group, but also a much sharper demarcation
from the heirs of the left of social democracy. In this sense and despite
the exhaustion of militant energy these polemics entailed, we consider
it to be indispensable and fruitful not only for our formation as militants
but also for an increasingly precise delimitation of our movement in the
face of all the bourgeois parties and ideologies created against the proletariat.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">2. Despite all the difficulties presented
by formal-logical and bourgeois language, we are trying to express, in
the most precise possible way, the subject of revolution at the same time
as our concept of communism. For us the concept of communism is not an
ideal to be applied, but the movement of destruction of the society of
capital and the society resulting from this practical negation.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Contrary to what idealists believe, the true
subject of the revolution is not an inspired individual wearing his conscience
and his will on his sleeve. Nor is it a group of militants, even if its
action in terms of historical leadership is decisive. Nor is it the whole
of the proletariat seen as a group of workers. The real subject of the
revolution is only the proletariat as a force constituted as a party, as
a communist organic centrality that abolishes established order. Despite
what social democracy may think, it is not the leadership which transforms
the "trade unionist" proletariat into a revolutionary force. On the contrary,
it is the proletariat as a revolutionary force which determines the creation
of a revolutionary direction (not from an immediatist, contingent and localist
point of view, but from a historical, general and international one).</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Against the current of dominant ideology
and at the risk of shocking, we can state, if we put ourselves at a higher
level of abstraction, that it is not communists or the proletariat which
turn social movement into communist movement but, on the contrary, it is
<u>communism</u>
as a historical movement which, for the first time in history, finds in
the proletariat a truly revolutionary class capable of imposing communism
as an effective negation. It is
<u>communism</u> which co-opts the most
historically decisive elements of the class, those which always put forward
the interests of the
<u>whole of the proletariat</u> as the leadership
of the party and the Revolution to come.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">3. "And finally, while the bourgeoisie of
each country maintains particular national interests, big industry creates
a class for whom its interests are the same in all countries and for whom

<font face="Comic Sans MS">The huge problems facing humanity today - exploitation,
misery, war, famine, alienated and estranged labour, mass unemployment,...
- are inherent to, and the necessary prooducts of, capitalist progress and
barbarity. They can only be properly confronted (and understood) if, instead
of being seen in isolation, they are tackled in the context of their driving
force - the capitalist system, history's last class society, in other words,
a transitory society which is at the same time a moment of an historical
arch spanning from primitive communities to communism, and a moment of
the process of creating the material conditions for the institution of
worldwide communist society. Communism will not mean the end of human history.
Communism, the formation of a universal community of human beings will,
on the contrary, signal the genesis of truly human history, resulting from
the abolition of private property, social classes, the state, etc.</font>
<h1>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">2.</font></h1>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The primitive community was destroyed by its
own limits. Human beings, in producing the conditions for their own survival
(expanded reproduction), developed their needs and exploded the narrow
framework of this limited community. Exchange between communities (communities
ended where exchange of commodities began) gradually subsumed and revolutionised
their internal reality, thus bringing about the split between the use of
objects for immediate needs - use value - and their use as objects by way
of which others can be procured through exchange - the basis of exchange
value. This brought about the historical dissolution of these communities
and the beginning of the cycle of value.</font>
<h1>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">3.</font></h1>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If we consider the immediate result of this
process, the world seems to have been divided into innumerable different
societies, each one with a different mode of immediate production: proslavery,
Germanic, Asiatic, etc. If, however, we consider the process from the point
of view of its higher outcome: the development of money up to its transformation
into <b><u>world capital</u></b> - a necessary condition for the institution
of communism - the existence of itinerant trade and usurious capitalism
can be found very early on in the ancient world (pre-capitalist in the
strictest sense of the word, that is pre-existing capitalism), their expansion
already containing all the antecedents of world capitalism as well as the
subsumption of all immediate modes of preexisting production.</font>
<h1>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">4.</font></h1>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In all pre-capitalist social formations, despite
the limited character of political, national and religious,...etc. determinations,
man always saw himself as the aim of production: exchange was no more than
a means to an end. In generalized commodity production, in opposition to
all pre-capitalist societies, self-enrichment became the supreme goal and
money the be all and end all. Its accumulation became the determining factor
above all others (money as a means of exchange, circulation...) and thus,
as a result of a vast process, money imposed itself as the only being human
beings have in common, as the only community that unifies them. The development
of exchange compelled Capital to conquer production, making production
man's aim and self-enrichment the objective of production.</font>
<h1>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">5.</font></h1>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This historic process of the transformation
of money into capital is a process of concentration and international centralisation
of capital and, at the same time, a process of separating the producer
from his objective conditions of production (the creation of the free worker
by way of state terrorism). Put another way, it is a process of violent
expropriation of all producers who, deprived of the means of life, are
forced to become wage slaves. By globally subsuming all previous modes
of production and developing the material conditions for its own destruction,
capitalism became a system which is no more than a <u>mere transitional
form</u> towards a classless society for all humanity, that is the last
phase of the cycle of class societies. It is in this sense that its destruction
will mark the end of the prehistory of humanity.</font>
<h1>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">6.</font></h1>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Capitalism is differentiated from all previous
modes of production by its <b>universal</b> essence - a condition for the
unification of the whole of humanity - and also by the simplification/exacerbation
of class contradiction: society is divided into two great enemy camps,
two classes in direct confrontation, the bourgeoisie and the proletariat.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Through its development, capitalism creates
the conditions for its own suppression, not only by creating the arms which
will wipe it off the planet, but also and above all, by producing and concentrating
those who will take up the arms: the proletariat.</font>
<h1>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">7.</font></h1>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The proletariat is the inheritor of all previous
exploited classes because its conditions of survival bring the inhumanity
of the living conditions of all past exploited classes to crisis point
and because all the most profound objectives of their previous struggles
are concentrated within it. Nevertheless, the proletariat is distinguished
from the exploited classes of the past in that those classes did not have
a social project of their own and it was materially impossible for their
struggles to go beyond the framework of simple reactions attempting to
reconstitute the lost old community in an a-historical and utopian way.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">With the proletariat, the age-old struggle
against exploitation, dehumanisation and the subordination of human life
to the dictatorship of value, is assumed for the first time in history
by a revolutionary subject, that is to say a subject with its own social
project, valid for the whole of humanity and in complete rupture with the
civilisation brought by progress: the destruction of capital (and by this,
classes), exploitation, private property, all states... and thus the bringing
about of communism.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">This struggle is therefore not only the reaction
of an exploited class, but also and above all, the action of a revolutionary
class historically forced to assume its programme and to constitute itself
into the worldwide communist party (the overturning of praxis in the most
global sense of this concept).</font>
<h1>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">8.</font></h1>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Classes do not exist initially "in themselves"
(as themselves, defined by production or by the economy) and subsequently
"in struggle" (involved in politics). They only exist as opposed and antagonistic
organic forces. They therefore define themselves in practice by their movement
of opposition and struggle inherent in the relations of "production" and
in the antagonistic interests which they imply. Not "production" in the
immediate sense of referring exclusively to the production of things, but
in the global sense, as the reproduction of the species, reproduction of
exploitation, reproduction of two irreconcilable camps: exploited and exploiters,
the reproduction of private property and an ever-growing mass of beings
deprived by the property of others, deprived of all necessary means of
ensuring their conditions of life... and, finally, the ever more intense
reproduction of the antagonism between property owners (defenders of the
world of private property) and those whose very existence opposes itself
to them in the totality of their practical life in this world.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Therefore proletariat and bourgeoisie are
defined by their mutual antagonism: the bourgeoisie as the personification
of the capitalist relations of production, as the party of conservation,
as a reactionary force; the proletariat as the negation of the whole of
present society, as the party of destruction, bearer of communism.</font>
<h1>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">9.</font></h1>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The contradiction particular to bourgeois society
is present at the very heart of Capital, which has subsumed the whole of
humanity. Capital can only realise its own essence - as value which valorises
itself - by developing and revolutionising the productive forces. This
has the consequence of reducing the socially necessary labour time for
the production of all commodities or, to put it another way, this produces
a general devalorisation of all products, of labour power and of all productive
capital. That is to say that both the starting point and the goal of production
- the self-valorisation of capital - entters into an insurmountable contradiction
with the very means which it has put into action: revolutionising productive
forces = devalorisation. This appears in every crisis with the massive
destruction of productive forces which makes the invariably reactionary
character of the capitalist relations of production evident and causes
the contradiction with the productive forces to explode - contradiction
that only the revolutionary proletariat can push to its ultimate consequences.</font>
<h1>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">10.</font></h1>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Capital is just as incapable of abolishing economic
anarchy (its own law!) as it is of abolishing the proletariat (bearer of
communism!), the sole producer of value, value without which capital cannot
exist. Capital tries to increase the valorisation of particular capitals
but only realises itself by slowing down the rhythm of valorisation in
general, which translates into increasingly powerful phases of expansion,
inescapably concluded by crises, each one deeper and more brutal than the
last, challenging the very existence of the whole capitalist social system
economically, socially, ideologically and politically.</font>
<h1>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">11.</font></h1>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Democracy was born of the dissolution of the
primitive community, the development of exchange, the commodity, private
property, class society, the historic creation of the individual, of the
separation of human beings from themselves in the production of their lives.
Its development is the development of the dictatorship of value over human
need, the development of state terrorism against the exploited classes.
With the total domination of value valorising itself and the total domination
of the fetishistic character of the commodity - capitalist terrorism -
democracy reaches its peak. This does not concern a particular sphere or
a simple form of domination, but rather the invariant essence which perpetuates
capital's society - by atomising and unifying on a fictive basis. By subsuming
all aspects of life, democracy practically denies the existence of classes
with irreparably antagonistic interests in order to affirm the only community
which belongs to it: the community of money. This reproduces the free individual-citizen,
national competing-being, whose corollary is the people - all within the
framework of the structures of parties and unions which make up the state.</font>
<h1>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">12.</font></h1>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Democratic rights and liberties are nothing
else but the juridical codification of capitalist social relationships.
They relate men as buyers and sellers of commodities and particularly as
the buyers and sellers of the labour-force commodity. This codification
is thus the practical negation of the proletariat as a class. The owners
of commodities meet as juridically free and equal subjects. But this relationship
of freedom and equality between owners is no more than the reified relationship
between bourgeoisie and proletariat, the relationship between the former
as exclusive owners of the means of production, and the latter as dispossessed
of everything except their own labour-force. The kingdom of private property
for the bourgeoisie signifies the kingdom of total dispossession for the
proletariat.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Democratic rights and liberties, as ideological
mechanisms that ensure and really assert the atomisation of the proletariat
as citizens free to sell their labour force, only able to find a buyer
if capital needs it for its valorisation, are instruments of coercion,
violence and despotism, in that they impose free and mutual competition
between proletarians forced to produce ever more value or to starve to
death, and therefore constitute a decisive weapon of democracy, that is
of bourgeois domination.</font>
<h1>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">13.</font></h1>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The bourgeois ideologies - expressions of the
limited understanding of the bourgeoisie, whose point of view does not
go beyond the horizon of its own system of exploitation - permanently conceal
the real dimension of the polarisation of society between bourgeoisie and
proletariat. The bourgeoisie therefore explains democracy from its own
democratic point of view; it starts out from its own immediatist and a-historical
point of view to explain society, thus concealing the transitional character
of its mode of production. More particularly, the bourgeoisie conceals
the revolutionary force, the only force capable of wiping out this society:
<b><u>the
proletariat</u></b>. The proletariat, as opposed to the bourgeoisie, does
not fear historical evolution and consequently does not resort to nor require
any ideology whatsoever. It affirms its class dictatorship as the negation
of all classes and as the process of its self-negation. Its own being is
the negation of capitalist society. The catastrophic nature of capital
forces the proletariat to constitute itself as an international force to
sweep away the whole of the social system and all its ideologies.</font>
<h1>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">14.</font></h1>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The very development of democracy sees to it
that the present importance of the simplification/exacerbation of the contradictions
of capitalism is being concealed by the permanent obliteration of class
frontiers. This is affirmed by specific ideological forms which develop
total confusion in this respect, mainly those based on a complicated set
of juridical and formal statutes that supposedly divide society - not into
two antagonistic classes - but into an indeterminate number of more or
less vague and elastic categories.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">This is how, for instance, at one pole of
society, a whole of juridical forms conferring pseudo-waged status tends
to camouflage the bourgeois nature of entire structures of the state. This
is the case, for instance, for army and police officers or for high level
officials in administration or in industry, for bureaucrats of all kinds...
who, under this cover, are classified as neutral categories, without any
class-belonging, or worse still, are assimilated into "working class social
groups".</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">At the other pole of society the same is
happening: a whole of juridical forms of pseudo-owners - "peasant" cooperatives,
agrarian reforms, artisans,... - which objectively camouflage the existence
of huge masses of proletarians, associated by capital for the production
of surplus-value (the wage character disguised). This and other ideological
mechanisms tend to present us as being opposed to each other and as having
different interests from those of other sections of the proletariat: urban/agricultural,
active/unemployed, men/women, "workers"/employees, manual/intellectual
workers,...</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">This complicated ideological process contributes
to maintaining the regime of bourgeois exploitation and oppression, concealing
our enemy and making it diffuse and presenting our class as divided and
numerically weak. The whole secret of the perpetuation of bourgeois domination
can be summed up as being due to the proletariat's difficulty in recognizing
itself for what it really is, in recognizing its own struggle in the struggle
of its class brothers (in whatever part of the world, and whatever categories
the bourgeoisie might be using to divide it). This recognition is an indispensable
condition for its constitution as an historical force.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">In its turn this infernal cycle is broken
in successive expressions of the catastrophe of the system, by the struggles
of the proletariat, by their generalization and tendency to coincide in
time, thus unveiling, each time more strongly, the affirmation of the same
negation of capitalist society as a totality. This negation is determined,
beyond its protagonists consciousness (always limited to communist minorities),
by the same interests and the same historical project.</font>
<h1>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">15.</font></h1>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In periods of revolutionary crisis, the two
classes unite against each other on the basis of their reciprocal antagonism.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">On the side of the bourgeoisie, despite the
tireless struggles between its different fractions to assert their particular
interests in the distribution of the means of production and markets, as
soon as the armed proletariat appears and the spectre of communism rises
up, all inter-bourgeois rivalry becomes of secondary importance to make
way for the worldwide bourgeoisie, assembled around the most coherent,
strongest and most determined faction, the one best able to face class
war. Although the counter-revolution generally confronts its historical
enemy in this way, it is obviously not prevented from combining in other
special ways: one of which is the repolarisation of society into two inter-bourgeois
groups, both of which attempt to contain the proletariat.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">In fact, successive counter-revolutions confirm
the flexibility with which the bourgeoisie is able not only to alternate
unification with internal polarisation, but also to unite in the defence
of an inter-bourgeois polarisation to confront the revolution (a false
polarisation relative to that of class against class).</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">On the side of the proletariat, as soon as
it breaks the chains of competition and joins together in its struggle
against its historical enemy, it asserts itself as a force and as a party
by centralising itself around the most coherent, strongest and most determined
factions, the ones best able to confront capital. In this sense, it is
without doubt that there are sectors of the proletariat that are strategically
important because of their ability to paralyse the decisive centres of
accumulation of capital (major industries, mines, transport, communication
etc.). These sectors are not always the most determined, nor those who
best guarantee the generalisation of the revolution. There are other sectors,
such as those without a job in general or young proletarians in particular
who have not yet found (or know that they will never be able to find) a
buyer for their labour power - sectors which are often camouflaged by a-classist
denominations such as "youths", "students" or "school-kids". These sectors
can play a decisive role in the qualitative step of the movement that always
implies rupture from the narrow framework of the factory, by taking to
and occupying the streets, by the effective generalisation of the struggle
and by the transition to territorial associationism in the face of which
the bourgeoisie can no longer offer reforms, be they partial or sectional,
thus raising the general issue of power in society. This formidable revolutionary
energy cannot be a force, in the historical sense of the word, without
constituting itself as a centralised party. (Without this, it will be wasted,
possibly even turned to the counter-revolution's advantage.) However, this
movement cannot form a centralised party unless it puts forward an entirely
communist programme and gives itself a revolutionary direction. The communist
programme and direction themselves are not the immediate result of the
movement, however much revolutionary energy it may have, but rather the
result of all accumulated prior experience, transformed into a living force,
into an organ of direction of the party and the revolution by a long and
hard, conscious and voluntary historic struggle assumed by the communist
factions.</font>
<h1>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">16.</font></h1>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The development of capitalism engenders the
development of its historic gravedigger and at the same time determines
the latter's essential conditions of struggle. This does not mean that
proletarian struggle is somehow similar or equal to that of the bourgeoisie,
but rather that it engenders the very conditions in which this struggle
develops and determines it as antagonistic to capital, making the proletarian
revolution <b><u>unique and distinct</u></b> from all those that have gone
before it.</font>
<h1>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">17.</font></h1>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It is in this way that capitalism engenders
a <b><u>revolutionary</u></b> class which is an <b><u>exploited</u></b>
class at the same time, thus creating a reality with no historical precedent.
No revolutionary class in the past, that is to say a class with its own
social project, was an exploited class at the same time.</font>
<h1>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">18.</font></h1>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bourgeois society thus develops a particular
sphere - the proletariat - which is the <b><u>negation</u></b> of all particular
spheres. Capitalist society thus gives rise to a class determined to constitute
itself as such and to transform itself into the dominant class to <b><u>abolish
all classes</u></b>. Therefore, the proletariat is a being whose full realisation
lies in its own abolition. Revolutionary classes of the past asserted themselves
as a power and as a particular sphere, in order to set up a different type
of domination, in whose defence they consolidated themselves as reactionary
forces. The proletariat, on the contrary, asserts itself as a class to
eliminate all domination, all exploitation and all states.</font>
<h1>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">19.</font></h1>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is how the worldwide character of capitalism
engenders the proletariat as a <u>worldwide class</u>, without any regional,
sectorial or national interests to defend.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">On the contrary, the bourgeoisie not only
realised its revolution by asserting its particular interests, but its
own essence (competition) permanently forces the bourgeois to oppose each
other brutally and to confront each other at all levels over the distribution
of the means of production and markets. Unity among bourgeois (limited
companies, agreements between monopolies, national states, constellations
of states,... the world state) is always realised to ensure that commercial
war and/or class war are confronted under the best possible conditions.
This unity may explode at any moment into its various particular fractions.
That's why, however unified and generalised the action of the bourgeoisie,
it always contains division; that's why all peace is a phase of a war to
come, whilst any action of the proletariat, however partial it may be,
contains universality, that is to say: however regionally or sectorially
limited an action of this class against capital may be, it contains the
affirmation of the unique interests of the proletariat in every part of
the world and the struggle for universal social revolution.</font>
<h1>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">20.</font></h1>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">These fundamental and inseparable elements,
which we only present separately here for the sake of clarity, constitute
the essence of the proletariat's revolutionary struggle and determine the
totality of the content of its action. It is on this basis that the most
determined elements of the class organise and resolve the enormous problems
that the struggle has posed, poses and will continue to pose. It is imperative
that every tactical decision ensues from this
<b><u>invariant strategic
whole</u></b>, as the indissociable unity of the totality of the movement,
of its goals and its means. Any tactic which strays from this basis is,
at best, an error made by the working class, although in the majority of
cases it is a vehicle of Capital's counter-revolutionary politics.</font>
<h1>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">21.</font></h1>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The <b><u>communist programme</u></b> is nothing
other than the whole of practical consequences of these determinations
of social antagonism and of their development up to worldwide proletarian
revolution, and the institution of communism as a society. Nevertheless,
reality precedes human consciousness of it, which is why the formalisation
of this programme, far from being reached in a single historical moment,
is the successive result of a whole of social upheavals. Each phase of
revolution and counter-revolution (each one more profound until worldwide
revolution) allows a better understanding of the consequences of the essential
determinations of revolutionary struggle, in other words, each phase permits
theoretical clarification, in an increasingly thorough and precise form,
of the implications already practically contained within these invariant
determinations.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">The objective of the proletariat, and thus of
communists, is (as already formulated by the League of Communists' statute
1847): "The overthrow of the bourgeoisie, the domination of the proletariat,
the abolition of the old bourgeois society based on class antagonisms and
the institution of a new society, without class and private property".
Or, as Engels confirmed: "the programme of our party... is not only socialist
in general, but directly communist, that is to say a party whose final
goal is the suppression of all states and thus of democracy."</font>
<h1>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">23.</font></h1>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This necessarily implies the constitution of
the proletariat as a class and thus as a worldwide party, in other words,
into an organic and centralised force, opposed to the whole existing social
order.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">The organisation of the proletariat as a
class tends to be constantly undermined by the competition between proletarians
as free and equal sellers of the labour force commodity. A whole of ideological,
political and military forces cements this atomisation upon which social
peace and bourgeois order are based. In such conditions, and despite the
fact that the proletariat is, in its own essence, an irreconcilable adversary
and a permanent threat to the bourgeoisie, the proletariat maintains no
more than a vague impression of its social antagonism to capitalist order.
It tends to transform itself into a political appendage of capitalist society
by its dissolution/destruction into the people. Democratic fronts, national
unity, popular fronts, fronts of national liberation, national-socialism
or social nationalism... flourish in this climate, as do all expressions
of the bourgeoisie's negation of the proletariat as a class, which on a
higher level, culminates in massacre in capitalist war.</font>
<h1>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">24.</font></h1>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But class antagonisms inevitably start to reappear.
The proletariat emerges as a class, as a party, stronger, firmer, more
decided, showing by its very essence that its existence is only possible
<b><u>by
excluding all fronts, all class alliances</u></b>. Even at the time of
the so-called bourgeois revolution, the proletariat asserted itself as
a class by trying to organise its revolutionary terror and class dictatorship.
In the face of this programme the bourgeoisie, including its most "progressive"
fractions, retreated terrified, resorting to the most "reactionary" sectors
of society to enforce the cannibalism, the terror, of the counter-revolution
together.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">It is certainly true that, more than once,
proletarian struggle may have coincided in time and space with some fraction
of the bourgeoisie in its confrontation with the same enemy (struggle against
the enemies of one's enemies, as Marx called it) but only as a partial,
limited and political coincidence, given that the proletariat's social
antagonism against its own exploiters is permanent. This is why this struggle
inevitably leads the proletariat to assert itself as an autonomous force
which threatens the bourgeoisie as a whole, all its fractions taking on
a single and identical policy of counter-revolutionary terrorism.</font>
<h1>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">25.</font></h1>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Capitalism, as a worldwide system, in developing
the proletariat as a worldwide class, makes communism possible across the
globe. At the same time, it determines the programmatical aspects essential
for the extension of the revolution and the character of the organs of
the proletariat:</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Communist revolution (its first insurrectional
triumphs inevitably taking place in certain parts of the world) is necessarily
worldwide: <b><u>either it spreads or it dies!</u></b></font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">The proletariat cannot reach its objectives
at any other level, whether at that of the factory, the region, the country
or even a group of countries. No kind of what is historically termed "workers'
control", "self-managed production" of one or all the companies in a country
leads to the destruction of the capitalist production relationship nor
is it, in any way, the path towards this destruction. Communism, as a movement,
opposes and excludes, at its origin, homeland, nation and national struggle.
The abolition of all borders and nations is inherent in its development.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">The constitution of the proletariat into
a single body acting on a worldwide level implies organic centralism. Organic
centralism guarantees the general interests of the movement against all
particularism, localism, immediatism and it also struggles against corporatist,
federalist and self-managementist ideologies which are only of benefit
to the counter-revolution. This is obviously the case for all class organisations
- associations, formal parties, state.... - and during all phases of the
struggle, whether the proletariat is a dominated or dominating class.</font>
<h1>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">26.</font></h1>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><u>The workers have no homeland</u> and one
cannot take away from them what they don't possess. Any form of defence
of the nation, whatever the pretext, is in reality an attack on the whole
worldwide working class. Under the reign of the bourgeoisie, all wars are
<u>imperialist
wars</u>, with two or more opposing fractions or groups whose interests
are world capital. The proletariat wages and demands only one war: social
war against the whole bourgeoisie. Independent of the immediate intentions
of the protagonists, the essential function of wars is to assert Capital
and to objectively and subjectively smash the subversive class at the heart
of this society. Therefore, far from being "simple" wars between national
states, between the forces of "national liberation" and "imperialist" forces
or "inter-imperialist wars", they are, in their essence, <b><u>wars of
capital against communism</u></b>.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">In the face of all the inter-bourgeois antagonisms
between "progressive" and "reactionary", "fascist" and "anti-fascist",
"left wing" and "right wing" fractions (the logical continuation of which
is imperialist war) the proletariat has only one possible response: intransigent
struggle for its own class interests, against all sacrifices, against every
truce and national solidarity, that is <u>revolutionary defeatism</u>,
turning its weapons against its "own" exploiters and immediate oppressors.
The proletariat's aim is to transform capitalist war into revolutionary
war against the worldwide bourgeoisie, by way of the international centralisation
of this <u>community of struggle</u> against Capital.</font>
<h1>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">27.</font></h1>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The division of the world into three worlds
- "capitalist", "socialist" and "under-ddeveloped or third-world" - is a
product of the proletariat's defeat, aiming to consolidate and perpetuate
this division in order to destroy the organic unity of interests and objectives
of the international proletariat.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Even when this ideology is used "innocently"
as "a simple description of reality" it contains within it the destruction
of the worldwide proletariat because all such forms of ideology presuppose
that the proletariat should take on different tasks in each one of the
"different worlds".</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Over and above what those ideologists support
consistently or otherwise, all ideologies such as the need to deepen democracy
or to fight for socialism in the "first world" alone, the need for political
reforms (or for "political revolution") in the "second world", the need
for bourgeois democratic tasks and national liberation in the "third world"
lead irrevocably to the proletariat's self-negation as an international
class and this means, in practice, that proletarians are made to participate
in various inter-fractional fights and capitalist wars, in permanent capitalist
wars for dividing up the world.</font>
<h1>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">28.</font></h1>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">National liberation struggles, popular anti-imperialist
wars... are specific expressions of the ideology which uses workers as
cannon fodder in capitalist war. Imperialism is not a phenomenon particular
to any one power or state. It is an inherent and invariant phenomenon of
Capital itself: each atom of value valorising itself contains all the conditions
of imperialist terrorism. This is why all the bourgeoisie is imperialist
and, in practice, is inextricably linked with the most powerful fractions
of world capital, not only by way of its direct participation in Limited
Companies and international financial capital, but also through thousands
of implicit or explicit deals.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">The proletariat leads its own fight against
its exploiters in the face of imperialist wars. In doing so it is considered
indifferentist or a saboteur, but this is only a reflection of the coherence
of world capital. The proletariat can never be indifferent to its own exploitation,
nor can it ever accept a truce with its own exploiters under any pretext.
On the contrary, the continuity and development of this fight against all
oppressors lead it to gather in action with its class brothers over the
whole planet as one single <b><u>community of struggle</u></b> against
worldwide capital, a community upon which the international and internationalist
organisation of the proletariat is based.</font>
<h1>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">29.</font></h1>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">As revealed in thesis 11, <b><u>communism</u></b>,
throughout its historical development as well as in its objective, is the
<b><u>living
contradiction of democracy</u></b> (of its rights, its citizens, its organizations,...).
The realisation of communism presupposes the elimination of all divisions
originating from commodity production, upon which democracy is based and
therefore the destruction of all democracy.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">An essential lesson for the proletariat follows
on from this thesis. Whatever the stage of the struggle it is involved
in, by accepting democracy, whether as a front (e.g. as an alliance with
a fraction that is considered more "democratic", "antifascist" or "anti-imperialist"),
as part of a transient objective (e.g.. the fight for democratic rights),
as a principle within its own organisation (the search for political guarantees
in elections, assemblies, majorities, congress,...) or as a final objective
("the formation of a truly democratic society") the proletariat does not
only objectively and totally renounce its goals and its own formation into
party, the prefiguration of the worldwide human community, but also (and
inseparably) renounces its own formation as proletariat, its interests
and thus its own being.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">In all these cases it denies itself as a
class, reinforces its oppressors and excludes itself (the only assertion
of its being) as a force antagonistic to existing social order by dissolving
itself in the classless world of citizens:</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><b>*</b> In the case of the democratic front,
the proletariat drowns in the majority, in the world of the citizen, in
"antifascist resistance", contributing to the abolition of its own class
autonomy and, for the future, legitimises the "spectacle of renewal" of
the face of the state.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><b>*</b> In the case of the fight for democratic
rights the proletariat, if it takes part, will only reinforce the weaponry
of the state, of its own enemy.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><b>*</b> In the case of democratic centralism,
the proletariat commits suicide by attributing a character of principle
to types of organisation which actually embody the separations between
individuals (separations between theory and practice, decision and action,
legislative and executive, individual and society) and which will disappear
with them.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><b>*</b> Finally, the proletariat makes itself
ideologically bourgeois by considering what is really capitalist society's
ideal (<b>pure democracy</b>) to be its own objective.</font>
<h1>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">30.</font></h1>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Workers'" democracy (that is to say: "the government
of working people") maintains all the mediations between politics and economics
and between man and society which are specific to capital. It substitutes
the cult of parliament and the freedom of atomised individuals for that
of "democratic soviets", "free unions", "sovereign general assemblies"
and the "free worker", which, from the point of view of content, are exactly
the same: in both cases the subject is not a subversive class, with a revolutionary
programme and direction, but a free individual, whether "a worker" or not.
To the bourgeois democratic version of the a-classist myth of the citizen,
the people, the Nation corresponds this other version of workers democracy
(just as a-classist and bourgeois) of "the workers", "the proletarian masses"
(defined sociologically) and the "exploited majority". Once again, the
terminology "worker" serves to hide and to pass off democracy, the foundation
stone of capitalist society, as a workers' victory.</font>
<h1>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">31.</font></h1>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The social democratic separation between "economic
struggle" and "political struggle", "trade union struggle" and "revolutionary
struggle", "immediate struggle" and "historic struggle"... is the already
classical bourgeois method for fragmenting and liquidating workers' struggles.
A workers' organisation which adopts this false distinction sows confusion
in the proletarian ranks and thus contributes - whether it wants to or
not - to the maintainance of the disorganisation and disorientation of
the movement and to the alteration of the all-encompassing substance of
the class war. It is criminal to confuse the social movement with the banner
flying above the heads of its protagonists, to confuse Capital's reformist
proposals with the affirmation of the proletariat's interests and demands.
To do so means accepting the translation of class struggle into bourgeois
terms, just as trade unionists and other social democrats have always done
throughout the history of the proletariat.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Even if a proletarian struggle starts off
on the basis of still partial denials, such as the struggle against price
rises, against the extension and/or intensification of work, against measures
which leave masses of proletarians out of work or against whatever economic
or repressive measure of the state, it is, in its content, a struggle against
the rise of exploitation itself (rate of surplus value) and against exploitation
itself, struggles that are indissociable for the proletariat as the exploited
and revolutionary class. The indissociability of struggles of the proletariat
comes out into the open when, in situations of crisis, the most minimal
economic proletarian demand implies a direct attack on the rates of exploitation
and profit for Capital, an attack on the sacrosanct competitiveness of
the national economy. Confrontation between the capitalists associated
as state and the proletariat, then becomes inevitable.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">The fact that whichever bourgeois banner
flies over the movement or whichever reform of Capital appears as the objective
of the struggle, is not just a bourgeois lie; although it sometimes <u>is</u>,
above all when proletarians receive information in one part of the world
concerning struggle in another, filtered by the mass media. If we were
to accept what was said we would have to believe that class struggle has
disappeared and that there is nothing but national, religious, racial or
democratic struggles. But the use of a bourgeois banner as the movement's
standard is also an objective force which, as a real weakness of the movement,
helps to crush it.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Failing to recognize this reality and not
developing a consequent struggle against this objective weakness of our
class, is to fail to recognise that the dominant ideology is that of the
dominant class. It is to fail to recognize that the subversive movement
of this society can only express itself for what it really is, on the basis
of its vanguard factions, which are necessarily minoritarian during the
whole of the pre-insurrectional process and, in all certainty, immediately
afterwards. Expressing itself for what it really is signifies rising up
with slogans which explicitly negate present-day society, such as for the
abolition of wage labour.</font>
<h1>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">32.</font></h1>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There also exist other social democratic dichotomies
such as "economics versus politics" and "theory versus practice" that in
every case divide up the revolutionary process in order to liquidate and
destroy its subversive unity. One particularly notable case of such a conception
is the one according to which the capitalist mode of production is divided
into periods: a period/phase which is "ascendant", "progressive" or based
on "formal domination"... and another, defined as "decadent", "reactionary",
"imperialist" or based on "real domination".</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Capital's own development is always its greatest
reform, its constant transformations and its necessary quantitative as
well as qualitative changes (value must permanently valorise itself) are
marked, not by two antinomic phases (ascendance/decadence) but by a succession
of levels (the only basis for a periodisation of capitalism) in which all
contradictions (the most basic of which is valorisation/devalorisation)
appear in an increasingly exacerbated form each time.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">All theories of decadence destroy the universality
of the capitalist mode of production (in time and/or in space). They lead
inevitably to the liquidation of the invariance of the interests and needs
of the revolutionary proletariat, thus ultimately negating the one and
only gravedigger of the old world, the active agent in the catastrophic
fall of the system. These theories lead the decadentists inescapably into
the arms of immediatism, gradualism, evolutionism, fatalism...deadly traps
for classist militancy. All the decadentist theories (quite apart from
the fact that they are no more than simple economic, that is to say bourgeois,
theories) lead to this result, whatever the type of argument used.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">The reformist practices inferred by all the
decadentist theories are also expressed systematically justifying/demanding
a posteriori the whole counter-revolutionary practice of social democracy
(thus as an historic totality that also includes official anarchism). This
is realised by way of the fallacious pretext that during the so-called
"ascendant" period, the proletariat would not have had communism as its
objective, but rather the struggle for reforms (essentially bourgeois struggle),
for its integration as an economic object in the system ("class" for capital).</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">All theories of decadence are based on the
idea that the bourgeoisie has of itself: that of progress, evolution, civilisation,...
as if they could be neutral and a-classist, as if progress under the bourgeoisie
could be something other than bourgeois progress (the greatest bourgeois
progress is always bourgeois war!), as if evolution under the bourgeoisie
could be anything other than the evolution of bourgeois exploitation. The
decadentists see progress, evolution and civilisation developing up to
a certain date (and, for the most consistent, in certain geo-political
areas) and then reaching a fateful watershed, justified in various ways
depending on the school involved (Stalinist, Trotskyist, Luxemburgist or
whatever), after which it begins to decline, to "objectively" collapse.
All this will inevitably be accompanied by "moral", artistic,... decadence
(something which all these currents have in common with the numerous religious
and fascistoid sects). All this is just counter-revolutionary ideology
that the proletariat in struggle will destroy.</font>
<h1>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">33.</font></h1>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Social democratic dualism and the ideology of
decadence which denies Capital as an organic totality inevitably leads
to the ideological creation of an ensemble of categories into which the
heirs of social democracy imagine the world to be divided. However, these
ideological categories, in so far as they have become dominant conceptions,
have become powerful weapons for dividing the proletariat. Thus, added
to the most classic bourgeois forms of categorising and dividing into countries,
such as the division of the world into three as we have already mentioned,
or the division of countries into "developed" and "under-developed", "central"
and "Third World", are other more subtle divisions, which fulfil the same
function - to sow confusion as to the unified nature of world capital,
to disperse and disorganise the proletariat by presenting it with different
projects or objectives according to region. In this regard, the ideology
of "state capitalism" is particularly pernicious. According to this ideology
there exists, in the "best" cases, different types of capitalism and in
the "worst", kind of half-and-half societies, "neither truly capitalist
nor truly socialist", in which "state capitalism" becomes a phase in the
revolution. All these ideologies, which constitute distinct varieties of
Kautskyism, Leninism, etc. are nothing other than the old Stalino-Trotskyist
myth of "Russian specificity" generalised to the whole world. Their central
objective is the negation, camouflage and covering up of the real antagonism
between the world capitalist state and the internationalist proletariat.</font>
<h1>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">34.</font></h1>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The force of counter-revolution bases itself
today on the exploitation of all the weaknesses of the great international
revolutionary wave of the years 1917-1923, made possible by the political
and organisational destruction of the communist factions who began to draw
up a balance sheet of this period.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">The counter-revolution erected the myth of
the "workers' state in one country" over the dead body of the revolutionary
proletariat (the myth of "socialism in one country" is merely its right-wing
variant), which served to use millions of proletarians as cannon fodder
in capitalist war. This so-called "Workers' State", just like all the others
which adopted this or other similar denominations (Eastern Europe, Cuba,
China, Angola, Vietnam, Algeria, Mozambique, Nicaragua...), is no more
nor less than a capitalist state whose ideology has expressly usurped some
Marxist phrases to better hide its bourgeois character. The whole planet
is capitalist. <b><u>The communist revolution will be worldwide or it will
not be.</u></b></font>
<h1>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">35.</font></h1>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All currents which support, be it in a "critical"
way or not, any state or government existing in the world today (Stalinist,
Trotskyist, Maoist, Third-Worldist, "anarchist"...) are nothing other than
reactualised forms of bourgeois socialism, born from the womb of social
democracy as an historic force. In practice, in addition to supporting
the apparatuses of the bourgeois state (governments, unions, parliaments...)
and contributing to capitalist wars, these forces are decisive in the transformation
of proletarian needs into capital's reforms. This inevitably leads them
to always act as the shock troops of capital for maintaining bourgeois
order.</font>
<h1>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">36.</font></h1>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">From Proudhon to Kautsky, from Hitler to Castro,
from Stalin to Mussolini, from Bernstein to Peron, from Mao to Khomeini,
from Arafat to Gorbachev...and other reformers there have always existed
progressist bourgeois fractions, partisans of great reforms, of populist
discourse, workerists, "against the rich", "against monopolies", "against
oligarchy", "against the few families who own the country", "against plutocracy"...
in favour of "social" institutions. These fractions correspond to the permanent
historic tendency of capital to self-reform and to constantly revolutionise
its productive base and social structure while maintaining, of course,
the essential: wage labour, exploitation of man by man. Their specific
function is to present themselves as alternatives to the classic forms
of domination (a decisive function for polarising society into two bourgeois
poles), to present reforms as the objective of all struggle and, in the
inter-capitalist struggle, to appear as the radicalising sectors of society.
Their relative importance, according to the epoch or the country, stems
from the credibility that they have in the eyes of proletarians, that is
to say from their capacity to control the workers and to wipe out all class
autonomy by means of reforms (or by the promise of reforms) aiming to render
wage slavery less visible and real poverty more "viable" and which, in
fact, consolidate the social dictatorship of Capital. Whatever its brand
of reformism, the bourgeoisie is the irreconcilable enemy of the proletariat
and, whatever its rhetoric, all its fractions systematically resort to
open terror against the proletariat - not just the privilege of the Right
or of the fascists - whenever the preservation of the system demands it.
In the face of these fractions, the programme of the proletariat does not
change one iota: the proletariat is obliged to organise itself as a force
to crush and liquidate all types of critical support for reform, along
with all the other fractions.</font>
<h1>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">37.</font></h1>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The objective of the bourgeois state, the democratic
state, is to keep the proletariat disorganised, denied as a class or, better
still, contained and mobilised in the service of the bourgeoisie. What
is essential to all democratic mechanisms is the destruction of the organic
unity of the proletariat, its interests and its "organisation" into partial
"interests" which correspond to the individual, the citizen (homo economicus),
buyer and seller of commodities. Unions are vital organs of the bourgeois
state which fulfil this function. In effect, they represent the "world
of work" within Capital, that is to say the proletariat liquidated as a
class, divided into sectors, negotiating (like any other individual in
mercantile society) the selling price of their commodity - labour power
- which, in turn, assures a "reasonable"" rate of profit and guarantees
social peace. In the face of this type of organisation, the proletariat
struggles <b><u>to organise itself outside and against the unions</u></b>
which, as obstacles to communist revolution, must be completely destroyed.
This is why all ideologies which recommend reform of the unions, their
reconquest or working within them (even if they say they are doing so to
destroy them) sow the seeds of confusion. They keep proletarians, who intuitively
sense the reactionary role of the unions, trapped in these organs of the
state (which also happens to help improve their credibility). They serve
reaction. The fact that, in numerous cases, we find real workers' organisations
at the origins of these organisations merely confirms the capacity of the
bourgeoisie to recuperate organisational forms created by the proletariat
and to use them for its own ends.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">The "trade union issue" is not a question
of denomination, but rather of social practice. The real antagonism is
not, as some would have us believe, between economic and political interests
nor between immediate and historical interests, because the unions, as
state apparatuses, do not even defend the "economic" and "immediate" interests
of the workers (which, as we have already said, are inseparable from the
revolutionary affirmation of the proletariat). The real antagonism is between
workers' associationism, the organic reconstitution of the struggle, the
interests of the proletariat and the apparatus of the democratic state
for mercantile negotiations. This is the case, whatever they call themselves.
In the same way, if the denomination "union" came to globally and solely
refer to these state apparatuses (which would make it rather unlikely that
real class associations would give themselves this name) other more radical
denominations (workers' councils, soviets...) could also be used to hide
state apparatuses outside and against which workers' associationism will
also necessarily develop.</font>
<h1>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">37a.</font></h1>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The revolution is not a question of organisational
form. On the contrary, the problem is its <b><u>real social content</u></b>
and, ultimately, concerns either organs of workers' struggle against Capital
or organs of the bourgeois state for the destruction of the revolutionary
force. In the case of the latter, the name or ideological cover adopted
to better assure their counter-revolutionary function does not change their
bourgeois character at all.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">It is obvious, however, that in the real
process of growing workers' associationism the proletariat is developing
more and more global forms of organisation, corresponding to its own development
as a class. Thus, for example, forms still marked by corporatism and sectional
aspects will be surpassed by the organisation of struggle on the basis
of places of work and by branches of production. In turn these forms will
be surpassed by territorial organisations in which the whole of the proletariat
(unemployed and workers, young and old...) can participate and centralise
themselves. This will represent a decisive spring-board, the proletariat
giving itself international forms which will fight against the respective
nations that the bourgeoisie uses to divide its historic enemy. This process,
within which different forms of workers' associationism succeed one another
according to their different levels of consciousness and confrontation
with Capital, is not a linear and gradual process. On the contrary, it
is a process marked by qualitative jumps, advances and also setbacks...
whose totality is determined by the balance of forces between proletariat
and bourgeoisie.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Workers' councils, soviets, industrial pickets,
class organisations organised on the level of a country, etc. are all forms
corresponding to this real process of development of the proletariat, going
beyond the divisions imposed by Capital, above all by surpassing the struggle
for categories or workplace (although councils, soviets, combinations,
etc. could still be based on association by category). This process corresponds
to epochs of open social and political crisis, in which the proletariat
can no longer believe in partial and particular solutions.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">However, even in the midst of this process
of associationism, it is never the forms in themselves which can guarantee
(as the councilists believe) the interests of the proletariat (nor any
other type of formal guarantee that the apologists of workers' democracy
would like to establish, such as sovereign assemblies, elected delegates,
revocable at any moment...). Within the real process of organisation of
the proletariat as a force everything will depend on the real practice
of these organisations and, therefore, on their effective <u>leadership</u>.
What is decisive is the class struggle on the inside of such organisations,
in which counter-revolution will continue to be present and organised,
acting to transform such associations into organs of the bourgeois state.
The sole guarantee against this is the decisive action of vanguard factions
of the proletariat who will not submit to any of the democratic mechanisms
which the counter-revolution tries to impose. With all their strength,
organised communists oppose any ideology tending to dissolve this genuine
leadership of the proletariat in formation into the midst of the whole
of the workers in struggle (or worse still, in the whole of workers as
a sociological category). They will not accept, under any pretext, the
discipline of these mass organisations which contradict every element of
the historical programme of the proletariat. By all means and to the bitter
end, they will lead the struggle against any attempt to give these organisations
a counter-revolutionary leadership to impose a genuine revolutionary leadership
on the movement.</font>
<h1>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">38.</font></h1>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Parliament and elections are the particular
forms in which democracy is concretised. They express the same bourgeois
need to dilute the proletariat into the mass of citizens, to practically
deny the existence of a class which is antagonistic to the whole of the
established order, thus reaffirming its own domination. Their specific
function is to divert workers from their everyday struggles against Capital
and to develop and reproduce the illusion of a peaceful change in the proletariat's
situation just by virtue of the ballot box (the highest expression of which
is of a peaceful passage to socialism). Elections serve to distinguish
between the different fractions and representatives of the bourgeoisie,
those which are directly charged with taking the top position in the executive
and directing the repression against proletarian struggles. Parliamentarianism
and electoralism inevitably turn their back on the methods and objectives
of the workers' struggle and cannot, in any form, be used by proletarians
in struggle. Adding the qualifier "revolutionary" to parliamentarianism
and claiming to use it to denounce bourgeois domination only (as has been
shown historically) serves to increase confusion in the proletarian ranks.
In fact it constitutes a powerful element for liquidating (through its
legalism, leadership politics, cult of personality) all activity aiming
to constitute the party of the class and it only serves the counter-revolution.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">The only proletarian response to the regular
unleashing of these bourgeois attacks known as elections is the rejection
of any electoral truce, the pursuit of struggle for exclusively proletarian
interests, the denunciation of elections and, wherever possible (as determined
by the balance of class forces) sabotage by direct action.</font>
<h1>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">39.</font></h1>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Racial oppression, sexual oppression, the destruction
of the environment... are inherent to all class societies, but no other
society has attained a level of atrocity as gigantic and as systematic
as under the reign of capitalism and more particularly, under the dictatorship
of the progress of capitalist civilisation, in its current development.
Only a global struggle can destroy the real basis of the alienation - estrangement
- of Man and all the inhuman manifestatiions and atrocities proper to capitalist
social relations. Only one social class - the proletariat - contains in
its being this project and its realisation, the communist revolution.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Contrary to this project, the liquidation
of the struggle by way of its fragmentation and the creation of specific
movements (feminism, anti-racism, environmentalism) tend to reduce and
to resolve each of these problems into a separate sphere, thus preventing
any attack on their profound and common cause. They are therefore irremediable
additional attempts to adapt, ameliorate and repair (plaster over) the
system and, by these means, to reinforce the dictatorship of Capital. Practically,
these types of movement have served and can only serve to divert the revolutionary
energy of the proletariat, to improve the mechanisms of domination and
oppression as well as to increase the rate of exploitation of the proletariat.</font>
<h1>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">39a.</font></h1>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For the first time, the universal exploitation
of a class containing all races and every possible racial mix and combination,
gives the concept of <b>the human species</b> the whole of its meaning
and validity. The only human and definitive solution to racial oppression
and racism lies within this universal exploitation, within the unique interests
of the proletariat and within the struggle it is forced to develop to impose
its universal social revolution. On the other side of the barricades are
the exploiters, the defenders and representatives of the system of social
production which, although they themselves are of every colour, act in
a unified way through the racist/antiracist discourse.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">This said, <b>racism</b> (and/or <b>antiracism</b>)
is more than just an ideological problem. The fact that Capital buys the
labour power of one race for less than another's, the fact that the conditions
of exploitation and the living conditions of one part of the proletariat
are worse than another's, reflect that in Capital's reality a human being's
production, as a wage slave, is of absolutely no interest as a human being,
but is solely determined (as with all other commodities) by the amount
of social labour incorporated into him. This racist reality of Capital
determines that, in the same way that the value of labour power of a qualified
worker is greater than that of an ordinary worker, the value of the labour
power of a "native" worker, for example, is greater than that of an "immigrant"
worker (presupposing that the former contains more work of integration,
socialisation, nationalisation and unionisation than the other).</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">In the international organisation of worldwide
bourgeois domination, racism is only able to present itself very marginally
compared to what it really is (overtly racist speeches by one or other
government or bourgeois party are relatively rare). In most cases racism
develops on the basis of antiracism. Antiracism thus constitutes an ideological
force which is becoming more and more decisive in the reproduction of exploitation
and of this racist society.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Any struggle against the racism of this society
which fails to attack capitalist society (that is to say the foundations
of racism), any struggle which, therefore, is not a struggle of the international
proletariat against the worldwide bourgeoisie transforms itself into an
additional ideological element of the state and of bourgeois oppression.
The most advanced expression of this antiracism could be found in the triumphant
bourgeoisie of the so-called Second World War and still constitutes a decisive
ideological element of all current great world powers. Antiracism is thus
the most refined form of reproduction of racist society: the state of Israel
was constituted on the basis of a fictional community of Jewish antiracist
struggle and is a particularly illustrative example of how antiracism serves
racist capitalist exploitation to take on its maximal expression in the
exploitation camps of the proletariat of that region.</font>
<h1>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">39b.</font></h1>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The division of labour by sex (or age) is an
objective element of the capitalist division of the proletariat which will
only be abolished through the liquidation of Capital and the auto-suppression
of the proletariat. Men, women, young, old... all proletarians, reproduce
their lives as labour power of Capital, for Capital. The direct production
of surplus value in Capital's centres of labour (factories, mines, fields,
offices,...) cannot be guaranteed if labour power is not itself produced.
Capital, inheritor of the patriarchal society, has developed this labour
power and whenever it has needed to it has used and still uses men and
women of all ages for the direct production of surplus value. However,
it has particularly condemned <b><u>proletarian women</u></b> to be the
principal agent of domestic production of labour power (production which
is part of the global production of the labour power commodity).</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Even if Capital, when it buys labour power,
pays for the whole value of this commodity, that is to say all the work
necessary for its production (domestic, educational, repressive, etc.)
the one who receives the wage is the direct producer of surplus value and
not the one who carries out this domestic labour.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">This element, in addition to others, constitutes
a decisive factor in the particular submission and oppression of <b>proletarian
women</b> by Capital.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><b>Feminism</b> is the bourgeois response
to this particular situation. Its starting point is to turn anything particular
to the exploitation of the proletarian woman by <u>Capital</u> into the
global condition of Woman in general. It thus transforms the proletarian
revolt of men and women into an interclassist movement whose rallying cry
is that "men in general exploit women in general". In addition to feminism's
global counter-revolutionary work as a force of fragmentation, of diversion
and of concealment of the real contradictions and solutions of the struggle
of classes, feminism has also been a decisive instrument of Capital for
gearing up proletarian exploitation. Thanks to equal rights, feminism now
leads the proletarian woman to take on a more active role in the direct
production of surplus value and to participate, side by side with men,
each time more directly, in imperialist war. From the struggle for work
for women to the demand for the right to vote via all the campaigns for
women's participation in the active life of the nation, feminism has always
been a force asserting Capital against the proletariat, a force whose greatest
achievements are female cops, the massive incorporation of women into patriotic
armies (a necessity for Capital in order to make the whole of the civil
population participate more and more directly in its war), female MPs,
generals, Prime Ministers...</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">39c.</font></h1>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The <b>fragmenting ideologies of world capitalism</b>
such as antiracism or feminism aim to prevent the unification of the international
proletariat. The importance of these ideologies can only be understood
by taking into account that each one of these movements of pro-state mobilisation
tries to suck in the majority of the planet's proletarian population so
as to divert it from its class and revolutionary objectives. The most radical
feminists never forget to mention that their demands concern women, who
make up the majority on the planet. Radical antiracism has the same pretentions:
the proletarian whose dark skin or characterisation as an immigrant or
as the son of immigrants determines particularly atrocious forms of exploitation
by capital, represents by far the great majority of the world proletariat.
Here also we see the importance of the revolutionary critique of such ideologies
which will be swept away by the unifying struggle of the proletariat of
all colours, of both sexes, of all ages, from all over the world and from
all sides... against world capital. It is in this
<b>community of real
struggle</b> today and in its development that racism and antiracism are
being destroyed and will be destroyed. It is the same for the so-called
"woman question" and feminism, etc.</font>
<h1>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">39d.</font></h1>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Capitalist development with its consequent <b>tyranny</b>
of the rate of profit <b>against the environment</b> necessary for human
life has attained such levels that not only are ever-growing parts of humanity
subjected to permanent hunger caused by desertification (or all other causes
also "naturally" produced by the valorisation of capital) but also the
permanence itself of the present civilisation has become incompatible with
life on earth in the medium term. This is occurring through the capitalist
destruction of the atmosphere and of sources of drinking water... without
even mentioning other "small details" such as the potential for generalised
nuclear destruction, universal air and water pollution (the increasing
accumulation of heavy metals such as lead and mercury in the environment,
the destruction of the ozone layer indispensable for life, the accumulation
of CO2 causing the greenhouse effect, the melting of ice caps and therefore
the risk of flooding of inhabited land etc.), more and more frequent industrial,
chemical and nuclear "accidents", with more and more serious consequences,
total inviability, in the fullest sense of the term, in that life will
be impossible in the major urban centres of the planet.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">The proletarian communist revolution constitutes
the only valid alternative to the barbarism of existing civilisation, in
so far as it can liquidate the basis of generalised contamination and the
causes of the destruction of all the environments necessary to the real
human life of the species.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">The <b>environmental</b> movement is the
bourgeois answer to the generalised degradation of all the conditions of
life. Be it parliamentarianist or anti-parliamentarianist, openly or secretly
reformist, environmentalism attacks the consequences and not the foundations
of generalised contamination. Its most important social function is to
divert the struggle waged by the proletariat against the brutal worsening
of all conditions of reproduction of its life. Consciously or not, the
proletariat attacks the basis of the whole society (the rate of exploitation,
the rate of profit, the competitiveness of companies, the economy,...).
Environmentalists aim to transform this into a mere struggle against the
excesses of a system whose basis they defend.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Organised environmentalists, with their return
to nature, their proposals for purification stations, for state control
of contamination, etc. not only defend the general basis of the generalised
commodity system (the source of all contamination) but also irremediably
give their support to austerity campaigns led by the state against the
proletariat. As if the proletariat wasn't impoverished enough, environmentalists
propose more austerity, to be more "natural": they are the best commercial
agents of the sale of "nature" and put forward programmes of austerity
and increased exploitation to the proletariat that no other sector of the
bourgeoisie would dare to promote. For the environmentalists it would be
better if it were possible to feed the proletariat on grass instead of
meat. Basing themselves on the huge myth that this society is a society
of consumption (while in reality it is determined by the production of
value), the environmentalists are the most cynical defenders of austerity,
of belt tightening.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">In an epoch in which the devastating effects
of commodity production leads to an ever-increasing mortality from desertification,
at a time in which capitalist development engenders irremediable physical
malformations and ever more numerous and incurable illnesses due to atmospheric
contamination, the revolt of the proletariat against the system continues
and in its development will face environmentalists of all kinds, further
obstacles that will have to be swept away to impose revolution.</font>
<h1>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">39e.</font></h1>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Capital only reproduces proletarian humanity
in so far as it is an instrument of work and a source of valorisation.
The "factories" where the proletariat reproduces itself as proletarians,
in which the species reproduces itself as simple labour power for Capital
are the <b>family, schools, hospitals, churches</b>, institutions of <b>social
security, prisons</b>, etc. All these institutions are, from top to bottom,
determined by the reproduction not of human beings but of wage slavery.
They will be abolished by the communist revolution along with the society
from which they emerged.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Faced with the impossibility of denying the
obvious antagonism between social revolution and the reproduction of all
institutions reproducing private property and the society of Capital, the
classical approach of revisionism, social democracy, is to recognize in
its maximum programme for after the revolution the existence of this antagonism
in a camouflaged form. In doing so it sabotages all practical and concrete
struggle against those institutions even to the point of being sufficiently
insolent to go as far as defending the existence of the "proletarian family"
or schools purified of all excesses... under full socialism! However, all
real struggles by the proletariat have <u>confronted</u> these institutions
and, in various forms, have fought <b>against</b> them. In all deep proletarian
revolts an irreconcilable opposition appears not only to institutions such
as churches and prisons, but also to the family and schools, etc. The essence
of all these institutions (family and schools included) is the reproduction
of private property and the state, whose very structure reproduces the
individual producer of surplus value, the "prole" as familial property,
reproduces sex or age based division of labour necessary for the reproduction
of Capital's labour forces and reproduces the discipline necessary to maintain
wage exploitation, etc.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">The struggle against the family, school,
just as the struggle against prisons, churches, social service institutions
or any other type of capitalist institution is a fundamental struggle which
is inseparable from all communist struggle against this society. Just as
one cannot put a problem as important as trade unionism to one side until
after the insurrection (given that we are confronted by it in every major
struggle), it is counter-revolutionary to postpone the struggle against
schools, the family, etc. until after the insurrection.</font>
<h1>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">39f.</font></h1>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Only the proletarian struggle can take up this
type of struggle. It is only within the <b>real community of struggle</b>
that proletarians can forge the bases of the destruction, of the communist
critique of the family, school and assert their own project. Any search
for positive alternatives within capitalist society falls inevitably into
reformism and bourgeois socialism because the real alternative to all these
social structures can only arise from this developing negation, that is
to say from the assertion of communism as a general movement of
<b>negation
of the whole of existing society</b>.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">In this negation in action, it is clear that
communists develop this concrete negation of the family, school, etc, with
all their forces but cannot, for one moment, have any illusions that they
will abolish those institutions without abolishing the real private property
from which they emerged. Communists have the advantage over other proletarians
of a global vision of the movement and its goals and of situating themselves,
in all practical aspects of the struggle, at the head of the proletariat.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">In the same way that feminism is the bourgeois
response to the "woman question", antiracism the bourgeois response to
the racial question and environmentalism the bourgeois response to the
question of the destruction of the conditions of human life, there is a
whole complex collection of bourgeois responses to the issues of the family
and school. Amongst these, we could mention the ideologies of the alternative
family, of living communities, "free love", the revolution of everyday
life, "free" or alternative schools, etc. It is not only a question of
the simple fragmentation of proletarian struggle, as in the other cases,
but of its effective liquidation on the basis of a whole of reformist projects
and ideologies which all have the reform and the reproduction of life necessary
to maintain wage labour in common.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Only the constitution of the proletariat
as a class and therefore a party, as a human community opposed to all established
order, contains the negation of the family, of school, of paternalism and
of the privatisation of relations in its embryo, in its development and
in the human relations which are forged in the common struggle. The effective
development of this negation will find an obstacle in all reformist projects
concerning school and family which must be destroyed in order to impose
its revolution to abolish them forever, in the same process as the abolition
of private property.</font>
<h1>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">40.</font></h1>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Work is the living negation of human activity,
life, satisfaction and enjoyment. Work makes man a stranger to himself,
to what he produces, to his own activity and to the human species. Work
is nothing other than human activity imprisoned in the framework of class
societies and the concretisation of the necessity for the dominant classes
to appropriate surplus production by exploiting and crushing the other
classes. Capitalism, in liberating (in separating) the exploited from their
means of life and production and in destroying old forms of production,
has imposed wage labour and generalised free work on the whole of the planet.
It has thus reduced man, everywhere, to the condition of labourer, a tortured
person ("travail" is derived etymologically from the Latin "traepalium"
meaning "instrument of torture").</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">In work, the proletariat is universally dispossessed
of its product, estranged, lost to itself, denied its essence, its life
and its enjoyment and rendered a stranger to the product of its own activity.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">As well as pouring its sweat, its blood,
its life into an activity in which absurdity competes with stupefaction,
it is separated from all immediate links with other people as human beings
and is thus separated from its own generic life, from the human species.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">It is only in the struggle <b>against work</b>,
against the activity that they are forced to carry out and against those
who make them do it, in the generalisation of this struggle and the consequent
calling into question of the totality of society that proletarians reemerge
as human beings and take the first steps towards a <b>communist society</b>
where the activity of people will finally become <b>human, for the human
being</b>.</font>
<h1>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">40a.</font></h1>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Capital has made work the most important activity
to which everyone is subordinated, man's essential activity. (We are not
considered for who we are but for "what we do in life", which in this society
means "profession", "job"). It thus couldn't be more coherent that all
the ideologies of bourgeois society make work <b>the essence of the human
being</b> and that this ideology is reproduced and supported by the hundreds
of millions of citizens who waste their lives every day to "make a living".</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Consistent with this, all the ideologies
of Capital are based on
<b>sacrifice, renunciation</b>, the internalisation
of emotions, feelings, sensations... To work corresponds sacrifice, and
to sacrifice, religion (including the Marxist-Leninist religion of the
state!) as justification for the repression of every manifestation of passions
and human, physical and bodily enjoyment.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">From the apologies of the left and miserabilists
of the poor proletarian to the dogmas of priests of every kind, they all
offer us "the afterlife", "the society to come" and death as the recompense
and place of realisation for men who, in the "present life", must live
in sacrifice, renounce all enjoyment and repress all pleasure.</font>
<h1>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">41.</font></h1>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Under Capital, everything that is vital must
be sacrificed and life is nothing but a sacrifice. The human being has
been separated from its <b>body</b>, its pleasure, its sex, its
<b>vital
energy</b>.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Flesh and blood has been permeated by centuries
and centuries of what is called civilisation.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Work, the police, the family, religion, school,
television, prison, psychiatric hospitals, in short, the state, are much
more than just the context in which that which pretends to be human is
reproduced, deformed, dehumanised. They also <u>shape</u> (and are <u>part
of</u>) <u>these bodies</u> which are repressed, separated, in confrontation
with each other. Under Capital, human beings are incapable of loving the
human being, are transformed into enemies of each other, even to the point
of repressing their own humanity, their own drives, their own energy.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">In commodity society people only relate to
each other through the mediation of things and as private owners of things.
<b>Universally
alienated sexuality and generalised orgasmic impotence</b> are the palpable
concrete expression of the absence of truly human relations, as bodies,
as totality.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Human beings do not live their sexuality
directly through their life and their energy, but rather through all those
embodied mediations of things and their spectacular images imposed by society.
Better put, they make these mediations the body's weapons and armour, so
that humans become no more than wolves for each other.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Bourgeois society itself has developed its
response to this castration inherent to being a citizen, to this repression
which permanently destroys vital energy. It consists of making a commodity
out of everything which is sexual - they sell women, men, children, they
sell images of pleasure, penises, vaginas, women and men made of rubber.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">During every revolutionary emergence of the
proletariat, at the same time as calling into question and shaking the
entire edifice of the bourgeois state, all human relations start to revolutionise
themselves and a real practical critique of generalised anti-pleasure (the
anti-pleasure so indispensable to the functioning of this society) begins.
Conversely, individualism and anti-pleasure return to make themselves omnipresent
in every triumphant counter-revolution or phase of descendant revolution.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">As with any other central aspect of the communist
revolution, the central enemy of the revolution is reformism, all the small
reparations made so that the essential can continue as it is. Thus, the
ideologies of free love, of freedom of sexual exchange, of the realisation
of pleasure in the midst of capitalist society, even when used as more
than just simple methods of propaganda to sell an object or a service...
have as their central objective the canalisation, diversion and destruction
of the revolutionary energy of the proletariat.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Truly human enjoyment has nothing to do with
such mercantile caricatures.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><b>Communism</b>, in its historical affirmation,
will free all potential for <b>enjoyment in the human species</b> and,
by destroying all slavery, will bring about a society in which physical
and sexual pleasure, bodily and orgasmic pleasure will develop <b>human
relations, the humanity of the human being</b>, the <b>human</b> species
itself to levels that are unimaginable today.</font>
<h1>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">42.</font></h1>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The development of exchange has brought about
fractures and separations of greater and greater importance in human activity
and, consequently, has brought each aspect of this activity into the grip
of the more and more omnipotent Law of Value. Capital has perfected this
process by subsuming every area of human praxis and by appropriating and
deviating all of man's creative activity towards the realisation of its
own needs of accumulation. By definitively separating creativity from the
rest of human activity it defines <b>Art</b> as the only field for expression
and creation, as the place and moment of all possible meaning, precisely
because life itself has lost all meaning. Art serves as an outlet, as a
ghetto, as an open wound of the capitalist system where its putrefaction
can fester. Capital encourages any writing, speaking and drawing as long
as these artistic products remain in the domain of <b>representation</b>
of what is lived, of the spectacle, without ever breaking through the barriers
towards the <b>transformation</b> of life. Within these limits, these products
are no more than commodities like any other.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Popular art, anarcho art, "proletarian" art
and its "worker" miserabilism... are merely different reformist and democratic
proposals which aim to sublimate the most spectacular aspects of the misery
of the proletarian condition by failing to see and to show anything but
misery in misery, in an attempt to keep the proletariat happy in its condition
of exploited class.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Contrary to what all radical reformists defend,
the alienation of art does not reside in the fact that art makes an abstraction
of misery (given that leftist artists fill this void!) but rather in the
fact that it is <b><u>creativity alienated, the alienation of all creativity</u></b>,
element of the bourgeois state which reinforces and reproduces capitalist
society.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">The communist revolution will destroy Art
(including "proletarian" art) as a product of class societies, as an activity
of human beings that is fragmented and divided under Capital. The communist
revolution will realise the creative aspirations of Man, which art pretends
to respond to in an alienated form.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">This proletarian destruction of Art and,
more globally, of the partitioning of different activities under Capital,
can be found even today (and it's an old workers' tradition!) in embryonic
form in the inventive sabotage of means of bourgeois domination and terror,
in the sabotage of machines, in the turning around of their weapons, in
the methods developed for escaping from or outwitting state control, in
using the bosses' equipment for our own purposes, in absenteeism... and
more generally in all the imagination and creativity shown by our class
in its struggle to subvert this world.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Generalised insurrection will be a profoundly
creative act, "artistic" even, and a crucial step in the <b>revolutionary
destruction of Art</b>.</font>
<h1>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">43.</font></h1>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The proletariat is the bearer of a society which
is classless and without the violence inherent to class societies. The
society from which it emerges is based on bourgeois terrorism, independent
of the more or less open form, with which the bourgeoisie exercises its
dictatorship. The cannibilism of the counter-revolution, the state or "para-state"
white terror obliges (and determines) the proletariat to respond to this
terror by means of <b>revolutionary violence</b>, by <b>red terror</b>.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">The <b>organisation</b> of this violence
which surges forward spontaneously from the very soil of this terrorist
society and the decisions regarding its application, are decisive elements
for preventing generalised slaughter, for diminishing and shortening the
birth pains of the new society. This is why communists are not only not
opposed to this violence but, on the contrary, place themselves at its
head in order to <b>lead it</b>. Pacifism (and anti-terrorism in general),
as well as the social-democratic distinction between the violence of the
working class "as a whole" and violent "individual" actions or between
"violence" and "terrorism", have never been - and can never be - anything
other than a cynical manifestation of counter-revolutionary ideology.</font>
<h1>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">43a.</font></h1>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">However, if it is true that the general condemnation
of terrorism or of workers' violence (necessarily minoritarian in its early
stages) is the general practice of reformism and of counter-revolution,
to deduce from this that violence or armed action is in itself revolutionary
is an ideological absurdity whose principal objective is to contain and
liquidate the combative sectors of the proletariat by making them serve
a reformist and bourgeois project. It is a moral point of view to consider
that armed struggle contains in itself either revolutionary virtues or
"human perversion", that terror is intrinsically good or bad, independent
of the <b>class programme</b> that it develops and independent of the social
project carried by this class, which is what will inevitably determine
the <b>form</b> and the <b>real content</b> of this violence. It is the
point of view of priests, idealists and voluntarists of all types, diametrically
opposed to the materialist conception of history and constitutes an obstacle
to revolutionary practice. It is certain that the social revolution will
be necessarily violent but it is completely wrong to pretend that violence
necessarily leads to revolution. Reform and revolution are not distinguished
by whether or not they use violence, but rather by the global social practice
in the service of or against the reformed reproduction of the system. The
bourgeoisie also uses armed struggle in its war. Opposition fractions,
reformists, nationalists of all kinds... have always resorted to violence
and to armed struggle to defend their own interests in occupying or participating
in the leadership of the state, to change its form, to impose some variation
in the form or type of capitalist accumulation that will guarantee them
a greater part of the increase in surplus value... Well armed though they
may be, "revolutionary" as their leaders may claim they are... these struggles
are nothing to do with affirming revolution against reform. On the contrary,
they are the <b>affirmation of reform and capitalist war against the proletariat
and the revolution</b>.</font>
<h1>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">43b.</font></h1>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">From the proletarian point of view it is as
absurd to try to socially characterise a struggle by its use of arms as
it is to characterise it by its diffusion of texts and leaflets or whether
or not its protagonists hold meetings or edit periodicals. Yet this confusion
exists at the heart of the proletariat and plays an important role every
time the proletariat reappears on the historical scene. The proletariat's
rejection of reformism and pacifism is not crystallised in a real revolutionary
direction and thus tends to assimilate all that is armed and violent to
that which is revolutionary. This is then exploited by reformism (armed
or not). As long as <b>the proletariat and its vanguard</b> are unable
to achieve the centralisation of their force and to develop their action,
their perspective, their <b>insurrectionary solution to the military question</b>,
this type of confusion and this exploitation will remain possible.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Moreover, given the heterogeneity of the
conditions of exploitation, of struggle, of consciousness... given the
enormous organic and theoretical ruptures that the proletariat has known
in its own history (ruptures produced by uninterrupted decades of triumphant
counter-revolution), and given the action of Capital which looks to attack
and defeat the proletariat bit by bit, it is clear that during periods
of proletarian affirmation it is extremely heterogeneous and discordant
minorities, carrying enormous ideological weaknesses which, in spite of
all weaknesses, assume a whole ensemble of violent actions and trace the
perspectives of development and extension of the future proletarian struggle.
In the face of this, state apparatuses and armed reformist groups (whether
manipulated or not) exploit the lack of centralisation, leadership and
ideological weaknesses present within these minorities, looking (and in
many cases succeeding) to separate them from the proletariat by imposing
a war of "apparatus against apparatus". Ideologies typical of militarism
(like the myth of "exemplary" action, the cult of "violence in itself",
of the "invulnerability of conspirators as opposed to the vulnerability
of the masses", "armed propaganda") separate these minorities from the
proletariat, its interests and its struggles. They lead to the containment
of these minorities in and by capitalist war, on the basis of conceptions
(such as "prolonged people's war") which are evidently the total and complete
renunciation of the insurrectional programme of the proletariat.</font>
<h1>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">43c.</font></h1>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This liquidation of proletarian minorities,
this utilisation and diversion of energy surging from capitalist society's
catastrophic decomposition, in the benefit of the maintenance of Capital
and its local wars, transforms the proletariat into the cannon fodder of
reformism of all types or into passive spectators, the public opinion of
a war of apparatus against apparatus. All this is rendered possible by
the historical period of counter-revolution, by the non-existence of a
centralised leadership based on the whole communist experience and programme
and which concentrates and centralises these reemergent forces, these proletarian
minorities, against the whole of Capital.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">With the development of crisis, and despite
its tactical interest in defeating the proletariat section by section,
Capital is obliged to homogenise its policies (there is only one crisis
policy: increasing the rate of exploitation and completely repressing all
those who resist) and this produces objective conditions of international
homogenisation of the workers' response. This situation is a necessary
and indispensable condition but not sufficient for its triumph.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">To triumph, this proletarian force must be
centralised, it must equip itself with a <b>leadership</b> which can practically
and adequately
<b>combine</b> the <b>arms of criticism with the critique
of arms</b>, which confronts pacifism on all terrains and reformism in
all its forms. This leadership will thus build itself, not only against
pacifism and anti-terrorism in general, but also against reformism in all
its forms and particularly against armed reformism, given that as a very
"radical" alternative it is specifically charged with recuperating and
liquidating the most radical proletarians who are breaking from the parties
and forces which traditionally control them.</font>
<h1>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">44.</font></h1>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The real communist movement, as a conscious
being, as party, has been distinguished in its long historical struggle
from all the forces and ideologies of counter-revolution by affirming,
each time more clearly, the indissociable unity between <b><u>the dictatorship
of the proletariat and the abolition of wage labour</u></b>. The destruction
of the relations of capitalist production is necessarily a despotic activity
(the despotism of human needs against the law of value) by the organised
and centralised force of the proletariat imposing its class domination:
the worldwide proletarian state. This state is neither free nor popular,
because it does not unite different classes or strata of people. It is
exclusively the proletariat organised as party and is not constructed in
the interests of freedom, but on the basis of the need to repress all the
forces of reaction by revolutionary terror. The various currents who, in
the name of anti-authoritarianism, deny the need for any state or claim
to make the state of transition "free", "popular", "democratic", or in
which non-proletarian forces would participate, are not only contributing
to sowing confusion amongst proletarians but are objectively serving the
counter-revolution.</font>
<h1>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">45.</font></h1>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The <b><u>proletarian state</u></b> has nothing
to do with the existing bourgeois state or with a "workers'" government.
The objective of the proletariat's struggle is not to "take the political
power of the state and put it to its service", as the bourgeois state (whoever
may be leading it) will continue unstoppably to reproduce Capital. Any
attempt to use the bourgeois state in the service of the proletariat is
a reactionary utopia and is one of the best methods of the counter-revolution
for diverting the devastating effects of a workers' insurrection against
the bourgeois state and against the tyranny of value valorising itself.
The struggle of the proletariat has, on the contrary, the objective of
<b>the
destruction, the demolition from top to bottom of the bourgeois state and
of its socio-economic power</b>. The bourgeois state will never whither
away. It is necessary to suppress and demolish it by means of violence,
at the same time as suppressing the mercantile and democratic dictatorship
from which it emerged and which it reproduces. On the contrary, the only
state which will whither away is that of the proletariat (the "semi-state")
which, in the course of its development, consolidation and extension, abolishes
itself in the very process of liquidating Capital.</font>
<h1>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">46.</font></h1>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The <b>proletarian revolution</b> has therefore
nothing to do with taking over the leadership of the state with the aim
of bringing about "social reforms". By contrast, from its starting point
to its final objective, it is a social revolution, coming from the social
need to completely destroy the total power of bourgeois society (military,
economic, ideological, political...) and has communist society as its objective.
The revolution emerges from the separation of real human beings from their
collective being (Gemeinwesen) and its objective is the constitution of
<b>Man's
true Gemeinwesen: the human being</b>. It is obvious that this social revolution,
in the sense that it requires the overthrow of the existing power and contains
the need for destruction and dissolution, includes political struggle.
However, when its organised social activity begins and its own objective
and content arise, communism rejects its political envelope.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">For this reason, proletarian revolution cannot
be reduced to an economic question of management of production, of workers'
control, etc. In order to realise the organised activity of society up
to the achievement of communism, proletarian revolution needs to violently
destroy all the institutions and apparatuses of the counter-revolution
which assure and maintain the dictatorship of value against human needs.</font>
<h1>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">47.</font></h1>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The politicist deviation according to which
the proletariat is supposed to take over capitalist society's state in
order to reform society and the economist deviation according to which
the problem is reduced to taking over, controlling and running production
and distribution are almost always combined into one and the same "theory".
They constitute fundamentally counter-revolutionary ideologies which have,
in crucial moments, served as ultimate barriers for the maintenance of
capitalist society. This is why the proletariat must confront them, suppress
them and bury them.</font>
<h1>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">48.</font></h1>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Obviously, before and during the whole phase
of insurrection, the proletariat will take over the means of production
(factories, communication centres, mines, fields...). All this activity
will have to have the internationally generalised triumph of the insurrection
as its central objective, firmly rejecting any illusions of managing society
without the destruction of the organised counter-revolution. To this end,
it is indispensable to achieve centralisation as well as the most developed
organisation of the proletariat into party as possible. Only the <b>Communist
Party</b>, solidly welded to its <b>historic programme</b>, can develop
a centralised and centralising action which can prevent localist dispersion,
self-managementist illusions, democratic federalism and exchange between
independent units of production (a source of private labour opposed to
social labour and therefore of mercantile reorganisation). Only the Communist
Party and its centralising action can give a single direction to all proletarians
and guarantee a maximum concentration of forces for the social, economic
and political crushing of the counter-revolution.</font>
<h1>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">49.</font></h1>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Armed insurrection constitutes a qualitative
leap in the struggle but this leap is not irreversible. Armed insurrection
does not destroy the bourgeois state. This will only really be destroyed
by the liquidation of all the bases which underpin it and this is not possible
in one country or even a group of countries. This is why, in the proletarian
bastions where the insurrection has triumphed, the proletariat will have
to use the power it possesses over that part of world capitalist society
to expropriate and attack Capital on every terrain (politico-military,
propagandist, economic, etc.), directly taking every possible means in
hand to orientate production and distribution in accordance with its needs
and interests (that is the needs and interests of humanity). This implies
the destruction of commodity society and wage labour. However, all these
measures must be strictly subordinated to a central objective: <b>extending
the revolution on a worldwide level</b>. Every illusion concerning the
possibility of constructing a "workers' state" (or several of them!) in
the midst of the worldwide commodity-producing economy must be rejected
as must, even more so, the illusion of constructing socialism in one country
or group of countries. This is why it is indispensable that the centralisation
and the effective leadership of the communist movement should be unique
and global and that every regionalist and nationalist interest (always
bourgeois) should be firmly combated, each part being subordinated to the
general interests of the movement. Only <b>the compact and organic centralisation</b>
of the world proletariat, constituted as party and fortified programmatically,
numerically, organisationally and militarily in insurrectional battles,
will be able to confront all attempts at capitalist restoration.</font>
<h1>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">50.</font></h1>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The proletarian revolution has nothing in common
with the political "revolutions" of the bourgeoisie - neither in its objectives
nor in its intermediate phases, except when it comes to the use of arms
and to the overthrow of the existing power.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Bourgeois "revolutions" try to change the
personnel of the government or one form of national state for another.
Proletarian revolution, on the other hand, has to destroy the national
state and liquidate every nation or country.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Bourgeois "revolutions" are made in the name
of the well-being of the people and reproduce wage slavery for most of
society. They use social terminology to better pursue their limited political
ends, using universal discourse to assert the particular interests of specific
minorities. Proletarian revolution, by contrast, however regional its starting
point may be, however minoritarian the faction which first throws itself
into struggle, however poor and politically limited its phrases may be...
possesses in itself a universal social content.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Bourgeois "revolutions" are based on democracy
and citizens' rights: they start out from the necessity for one bourgeois
fraction to no longer be separated from the collective being of Capital,
the state and they aspire either to control or to divide up political power
in the very bosom of democracy. Proletarian revolution starts out from
an entirely different reality, because the collective being from which
the worker is separated is a collective being with a reality and content
quite distinct from the political community. This collective being, this
community from which they are separated by their own work, is life itself
- physical and intellectual life, human  activity, human pleasure, being
human. The proletarian revolution does not therefore aspire to democratically
divide up power but, on the contrary, arises from the imperious necessity
to <b>liquidate this power, this democracy and everything which separates
the proletariat from its humanity, from its Gemeinwesen</b>. "The human
being is the veritable Gemeinwesen of Man".</font>
<h1>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">51.</font></h1>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">To finish off, it seems indispensable to us
to underline the decisive importance of the <b>Communist Party</b>. The
proletariat cannot exist as a class or as a historical force without its
constitution as party.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Calling for the party today signifies a reclaiming
and reappropriation of its invariant conception at the same time as separating
ourselves from all the democrats, by insisting that this central issue
of the Programme is not "a problem apart". Class and party are not two
different historic entities which should be separately defined only to
form a relationship later. On the contrary, they are the distinct expressions
of one and the same historic being: <b>Communism</b>.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">The essential determinations of the party
cannot therefore be understood from contingent realities or one-off necessities
without falling inevitably into immediatist conceptions (Leninist or anti-Leninist).
These invariably define "Class" on one side (as if it were possible for
this to be defined without its constitution into party) and on the other
side "party" (in general defined in terms of an historic ideal) so as to
later try to reconcile the two concepts, that is to "link" what they have
separated ideologically. The polarisations within this immediatist democratic
conception take place subsequently in the search for definitions of the
"relationship" between "Class" and "Party". In the same way, the fundamental
historical determinations of the party have nothing in common either with
the existence of some or other self-proclaimed "parties", little groups
which pretend to possess "consciousness", nor with the socio-economic adding
up of proletarians.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">On the contrary, for us the <b>party</b>
is; <b>Communism constituted as a centralised international force.</b>
It is the indispensable condition for establishing communist society and
its living prefiguration.</font>
<h1>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">52.</font></h1>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Communist Party is therefore the organisation
of the revolutionary class which will bring about communism. Its essential
determinations are those which make the proletariat into a class:
<b>organicity,
centralisation and a single historic leadership</b>. Without affirming
the party, even in any embryonic form, the proletariat does not exist.
("The working class is revolutionary or it is nothing".) However, the whole
process of organising into party is impossible without the long and indispensable
militant work of programmatical affirmation, of consequent practice and
of revolutionary preparation undertaken by <b>communists</b>. It is clear
that the party (just like revolutions) is not invented nor created by revolutionaries.
It is the necessary and spontaneous product of capitalist society itself.
However, this historical necessity does not concretise itself from one
day to the next into the full and complete existence of the worldwide party.
The party arises spontaneously, in that it develops inevitably on the basis
of a community of interests and perspectives, a real <b>community of proletarian
struggle</b>. This inevitable fact can only concretise itself when, at
the heart of this community, communism is simultaneously affirmed as its
programme and leadership, prefiguring
<b>the international organ of revolutionary
leadership</b>. That is, when this historical determination specifically
concretises itself in a conscious, wilful and organised action, when a
compact minority of solidly organised revolutionary cadres ("the Communists",
as they are referred to in the Communist Manifesto) affirms the historical
programme of the proletariat and assumes the indispensable task of leadership,
not only concerning the objectives of the movement (as the "life plan"
for the human species) but also concerning the strategic and tactical means
for its triumph.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Revolutions and the party cannot be created.
The function of revolutionaries is to lead revolutions and the party. This
minority of communists is a necessary and spontaneous (in the historic
and not immediate sense of the word) product of the organisation of the
proletariat as a single and centralised force and is also the axis around
which it realises the inversion of praxis, permitting its passage from
a simple object of this spontaneity to a conscious subject of the revolution
to come.</font>
<h1>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">53.</font></h1>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Communists do not, therefore, form a party separate
from and opposed to other proletarian associations or, even less, to the
organisation of the proletariat. They do not have specific interests which
separate them from the whole of the proletariat. They do not proclaim particular
principles to which they must submit the proletarian movement. Communists
only distinguish themselves from other proletarians in the community of
struggle of which they are a part. In the various struggles they highlight
and assert interests common to the whole proletariat, independent of nationality
("the history of the International has been a continuous struggle of the
General Council against... the national sections"). They always represent
the interests of the communist movement as a whole during the different
phases through which the struggle between proletariat and bourgeoisie passes.
<b>Practically</b>,
the communists are the most resolute faction within the proletarian struggle
in all countries. They are the organ which always pushes and carries the
other sectors forward.
<b>Theoretically</b>, they have the advantage over
the rest of the proletariat of having a clear understanding of the conditions,
the course and the general results of the proletarian movement.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">The specific organisation of communists has
nothing to do with the constitution of a separate party but, on the contrary,
it practically affirms the general tendency for the proletariat to constitute
itself into party, to equip itself with a <b>central organ</b>.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">It is evident that this conception of the
party and of the activity of communists opposes itself radically and totally
to all the democratic ideologies, some of which are worth summarising here:</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><b>*</b> The theory of communists as repositories
and bearers of consciousness.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><b>*</b> The "anti-substitutionist" theory
according to which communists must not assume practical tasks within the
movement (organisation and direction of action).</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><b>*</b> Finally, all the theories which
advocate, in one way or another, the dissolution of the specific organisation
of communists into workers' assemblies or councils.</font>
<h1>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">54.</font></h1>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The present epoch (as well as future epochs)
is one of growing socio-economic and political crisis of Capital on the
international level and of irregular and difficult reemergences of the
proletariat on the worldwide level. The present epoch affirms the tendency
to the <u>worldwide organisation of the proletariat</u>, albeit with enormous
difficulties given the decades of uninterrupted counter-revolution, the
cracks only appearing with the great social explosions which are becoming
more and more frequent. It is also an epoch in which groups organised consciously
and determinedly on the basis of the affirmation of the communist programme
are a tiny minority. It is a period in which the fundamental characteristics
of the sectarian phases which precede all phases of real proletarian affirmation
are being repeated, an epoch in which the <u>developing community of struggle</u>
of the proletariat on a world level against Capital is only conscious of
its objectives in the activity developed by a few nuclei of communist militants
scattered across the globe. The activity of organising and centralising
this community is and will be decisive. On the international level, the
activity of the class's real vanguard to enable this community of struggle
to become conscious of its own strength, objectives and perspectives is
and will be central.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">This tendency towards the worldwide organisation
of the proletariat, towards its programmatical affirmation and its organic
centralisation confronts, and will do so each time more violently, all
the forces and ideologies of the counter-revolution as described in these
Theses on a partial level (although care has always been taken to expose
their common essence). This tendency particularly confronts all the "bearers
of consciousness for the class", all the builders of parties and internationals
who consider that the "objective conditions" are ripe and that having "consciousness
and will" is enough to create the party", the "International" and who,
in practice, are acting in flagrant opposition to the <u>community of action
of the revolutionary proletariat</u>.</font>
<h1>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">55.</font></h1>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In spite of the fact that we are living through
an embryonic phase of reconstitution of the proletariat (a sectarian phase
par excellence), in spite of the deficiencies, weaknesses, partial experiences
and general ignorance of the activity undertaken by communist factions,
the need for international centralisation, the need to build a single internationalist
and communist leadership is making itself felt all over the world today,
albeit in an embryonic form.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Ranged against this development are a collection
of ideologies which, once again constitute the main obstacle to this tendency.
In the first place, it is important to point out all the ideologies which
suppose that the future "International" will arise by a simple addition
of already constituted national parties. Along the same lines, there is
a whole series of "creators of internationals" who, in general, have almost
nothing to do with the international proletariat's real community of life
and struggle and who, through interminable theoreticist debates come up
with a collection of formal principles to which they intend to make the
movement adhere. They even manage to dream up a collection of ideological
norms (declaration of principles) which, according to them, will guarantee
against deviations.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">No organisation, no product of the working
class serving the social revolution, has ever been organised on such a
basis. This is the classic schema for Capital's ideological organisations,
from churches to the bourgeois political parties.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">In particular, all these builders of internationals
are following the historical line of the Second International and its formal
centre.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><b>The international organisation of the
proletariat</b> will be the historic (and not immediate) product of the
organisation and centralisation of the <b>community of struggle</b> against
Capital, which develops practically and as such will be, once again, <b>outside
and against</b> all those who claim to mould the movement by proclaiming
a collection of ideological principles from the heights of their pedestals.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">The effective prefiguration of tomorrow's
international party already exists today in the real action of a whole
of not yet centralised proletarian minorities who, in the real struggle
and through their successive ruptures, join the historical line of the
invariant programme and the party.</font>
<h1>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">56.</font></h1>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Our little group is an expression of this community
of struggle of the proletariat and emanates from its tendency towards programmatical
reappropriation of all of the age-old experience accumulated by the world
proletariat, a manifestation of its international reconstruction and its
global centralisation.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">In concrete terms, our group is the product
of the centralisation of a whole of negations, ruptures, experiences of
struggle and balance-sheets of defeats. This centralisation is undertaken
by various comrades at various latitudes and is transformed on the basis
of communist theory, the accumulated experience of generations of revolutionaries
throughout the world, as well as of organized and conscious collective
efforts, into a living and active force for the international centralisation
of the proletariat. Thus the <b>Internationalist Communist Group</b> acts
in a conscious and determined way on the basis of the invariant communist
programme (of which these Theses are one expression) to
<b>lead</b> the
process of the constitution of the World Communist Party and the Communist
Revolution.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">This gigantic, age-old and invariant task
of consciously and determinedly assuming the material determinations which
push forward the development of the community of struggle of the proletariat
will be achieved through the collective work of thousands of revolutionary
cadres. It constitutes the indispensable premise for the party and the
Revolution of tomorrow and is already assumed today by revolutionary groups
and militants in different parts of the world.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Given the conditions from which this community
of revolutionary action emerges, following decades of counter-revolution,
it is now more evident than ever that this community is a <u>practical</u>
community of proletarian needs and interests, asserted and produced in
the confrontation against Capital and crystallised in the action of vanguard
minorities well before it becomes a community of consciousness (even as
far as the minorities are concerned). Thus, the organisation and centralisation
of this community will assert itself on the basis of coordinated action
against Capital (action that is already developing today in non-organised
forms), necessarily opposing all kinds of criteria of ideological demarcation.
Its organisation and centralisation will have an eminently practical demarcation,
through struggle. Theoretical differences and discrepancies, even major
ones, are (and will continue to be) inevitable at the heart of this developing
community, within every group of militants who are acting to lead this
process (including our own Group). The only way to resolve them will be
within this community, the unique political space where discussion takes
place <u>amongst comrades</u>.</font>
<h1>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">58.</font></h1>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">To be situated today <b>in the historic line</b>
of the party (as far as our feeble forces permit) signifies acting as the
most resolute elements, those who push forward the rest of the proletariat.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">To be situated today in the historic line
of the party signifies acting, in the most consistent way possible, within
the real community of struggle against Capital, to try to make it conscious
of its own existence, of its strength, of its perspectives, to organise
it and to direct it.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">To be situated today in the historic line
of the party signifies, with the same emphatic firmness with which we confront
the enemy in all its variants (including opportunism and centrism), being
comrades in solidarity with all proletarians in struggle against Capital
throughout the world.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">To be situated today in the historic line
of the party means passionately continuing the historic work begun by <b>communist
factions</b> to draw up balance sheets of past experiences and defeats.
It means working tirelessly towards the formation of revolutionary cadres.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">To be situated today in the historic line
of the party is to take on board the fact that our group, like any other
group of revolutionaries in the world, is a necessary and indispensable
expression and structure for the constitution of the party. But this expression
<u>is
not the party itself</u>. In the development of the party, in terms of
the historical arc, our group, like the others, is no more than an ephemeral
episode in the life of the party and its attempts to constitute an <u>organ
of international leadership</u>.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">In the same way that the League of Communists
and the International were only an episode (albeit indispensable) in the
life of the party, our action and our will are explicitly and consciously
led in the direction of <u>superseding the present "small-group form"</u>,
even if it is, without doubt, an indispensable mediation for bringing about
this supersession. It is idealist and reactionary to speak of the historical
party without being consistent and taking on practical activity that is
necessarily in the small-group form. However, it is fundamental and demarcatory
to be clear that such a group is not an end in itself but rather a mediation
to supersede itself.</font>
<h1>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">58.</font></h1>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">On the basis of these Theses we call on all
militants and revolutionary groups to centralise their efforts with our
own in the struggle for <b>the dictatorship of the proletariat for the
abolition of wage labour</b>. Within the community of struggle of which
we are a part, it is not a question of totting up ideological points of
divergence and convergence, but rather of effectively coordinating the
common practice that we are already undertaking and which will be reinforced
by this coordination. Nor is it a question of resolving the insufficiencies
and weaknesses which we all carry, each for his own and on his own patch-
this is impossible. On the contrary, the issue is to structure and centralise
the common practice which unites us and which constitutes the adequate
framework for militant discussion, to resolve the enormous problems that
face us. Comrades, the necessary revolutionary leadership will clarify
itself by consistent revolutionary practice in response to all levels and
all plans of attack by Capital. Up until now, all so-called "revolutions"
have been made in the name of science and reason and, correspondingly,
their ideologists have always elaborated a list of principles with which
they tried to mould the movement. This has nothing in common with the revolution
that we have before us. The Communist revolution will surge from the more
real and deeper necessity of real concrete human beings, the proletariat
asserting its interests for a truly human life. As such, the revolution
for which we struggle is and will be in complete rupture with all ideology,
all science, all reason and the very idea of progress.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><b>Comrades</b>, let's realise what we really
are and that for which we have risen up. Let's realise the consistent and
revolutionary practice of <b>Communism, the Communist Party</b>.</font>
