# The Party
1. I am for the party, but do not believe any existing organization is the party nor its sole nuclei.
2. The party must be international, and centralised to act as the brain of the class.
3. The party doesn't head the state, but it is part of the proletarian dictatorship, as are all other revolutionary forms of proletarian organization, such as the Soviets.
4. The party spreads the revolutionary programme to the class and intervenes within class struggles.
5. The party leads the class during a revolution.

# Economics
1. My views of the world are those of Marx’s Scientific Socialism.
2. I see communism as the only viable solution for the survival of humanity.
3. I believe an international revolution led by the vanguard party is the only way to establish the proletarian dictatorship via the soviets for the establishment of communist society.
4. The proletarian dictatorship is not to be understood as a defence of nations like China, Vietnam, Cuba, North Korea, etc. On the contrary, the proletarian dictatorship will have to be established in those countries via a working-class revolution.
5. I do not believe the soviets are organizations of workers from a specific factory, nor are they organizations of workers of a specific trade. On the contrary, they are organizations of delegates from the whole proletariat of a specific region, on the lowest level belonging to a town.
6. I believe communist society is inherently free of borders, class, money, commodity production, police, armies, state, scarcity, religion, the family, government, hierarchy, exchange, wage labour, etc. In the lower phase of communist society, the division of labour has not completely been done away with and distribution is based upon contribution. Under higher phase communism, distribution is based on need and the division of labour is completely abolished. 
# Politics
1. I do not advocate communism because it will create “equality.” I advocate for communism because we believe it is the emancipation of humanity, and will lead to the material human community and a new era of human freedom and development.
2. I believe the internationals of “Social-Democracy”, “Trotskyism” and “Marxism-Leninism” are the internationals of betrayal and the "communist" and "socialist" parties are bourgeois.
3. I see all unions, whether “rank-and-file”, “industrial” or “trade” as tools of the capitalist class to either keep consciousness low and fuck over workers or act as cul-de-sacs of any potential revolutionary action. I am for revolutionary organization completely outside and against the unions, although I believe that communists should work inside the unions to spread our programme, as unions have some of the highest concentrations of workers in some countries.
4. I am against collaboration with bourgeois and pseudo-proletarian parties and as such oppose the united front, which is a front opposed to the best interests of the class.
5. I oppose both fascism and anti-fascism. Historically anti-fascism has been used by Roosevelt, Churchill, Stalin and De Gaulle to justify mass slaughter of the proletariat and has been used as a cul-de-sac for revolutionary consciousness by the bourgeoisie.
6. I reject all “national liberation” ideologies as bourgeois, as the proletariat itself must revolt across the globe to establish a proletarian dictatorship, instead of the whole of the “colonized peoples” revolting and establishing a new bourgeois dictatorship.
7. I see parliamentary politics as a bourgeois merry-go-round and advocate abstentionism in elections. Change does not come through the ballot box, but through workers’ power via the soviets and vanguard party.
8. I am opposed to mandatory labour and believe that the division of labour (employment of people for a specific task) and employment itself (labour under communism is not paid, not because people work for nothing but because money no longer exists) should be done away with.
9. I believe that the family unit only serves a purpose in capitalism and should be done away with in favour of free association.
10. I reject the existence of police and the standing army during the proletarian dictatorship, as police are a tool of the bourgeois and standing armies usually lead to bureaucratization.
11. I do not believe Marxism is a “historically invariant” theory. Marxism is a fluid and changing doctrine, and is not set in stone. Support for a “historically invariant” Marxism is an abandonment of Marxist historical materialism.
12. I am opposed to civilization as I believe it alienates people from the environment, leads to the division of labour, leads to class society and is inherently exploitative.
13. I do not support giving the central committee of the party the responsibility of developing theory by itself, isolated from the rest of the party as I believe this is a recipe for half-baked theory and disaster.
