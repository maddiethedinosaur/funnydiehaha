## Section 2: About the Party

## Section 3: Views and Aims

### Views

#### "Actually Existing Socialism"
1. "Actually existing socialism" is a bourgeois lie to confuse and obscure the definition of socialism.
2. No country that calls itself socialist is or was.
3. These supposedly "socialist" states failed either due to being nationalist revolutions or isolation to one country.

#### Communist Society
1. Communist society has no borders, class, money, commodity production, police, armies, state, scarcity, family, prisons, schools, exchange, wage labour, or work.
2. In the lower phase of communist society, distribution is based upon contribution.
3. Under higher phase communism, distribution is based on need.

#### Family
1. The family is a social, legal, and financial unit represented as relatives expected to follow biological lines of descent.
2. The ICL supports the abolition of the family unit.
3. The family only serves a purpose in capitalist society.
4. The family will be replaced by free association and communal methods of raising children.

#### Humanity
1. The ICL views communism as the only viable solution for the survival of the human species.
1. The ICL believes communism will lead to a new era of human freedom and development.

#### Party
1. The ICL is for the party, but does not believe any existing organization is the party nor its sole nuclei.
2. The party must be international and centralised.
3. The party spreads the revolutionary programme in the class by interving within class struggles.
4. The party leads the class during the revolution.
5. Although we are for the party, we do not believe the party can replace the class.

#### Proletarian Dictatorship
1. The proletarian dictatorship is organized via soviets on various levels. The soviets are organizations of delegates from the whole working class of a specific region, on the lowest level belonging to a town.
2. The proletarian dictatorship is not a defence of nations like China, Vietnam, Cuba, North Korea, etc. On the contrary, the proletarian dictatorship will have to be established in those countries via a working-class revolution.
3. Police and the standing army do not exist during the proletarian dictatorship, as police are a tool of the bourgeois and standing armies usually lead to bureaucratization.

#### Revolution
1. The ICL believes in the neccesity of a international revolution led by the vanguard party as the only way to establish the proletarian dictatorship.

#### United Front
1. The ICL recongizes the internationals of “Social-Democracy”, “Trotskyism” and “Marxism-Leninism” as the internationals of betrayal and the "communist" and "socialist" parties as bourgeois.
2. The ICL is against collaboration with bourgeois and pseudo-proletarian parties and as such oppose the united front, which is a front opposed to the best interests of the class.
3. The ICL opposes both fascism and anti-fascism. Historically anti-fascism has been used by Roosevelt, Churchill, Stalin and De Gaulle to justify mass slaughter of the proletariat and has been used as a way to distract the class from struggle.

#### Unions
1. All unions, whether “rank-and-file”, “industrial” or “trade” are either tools of the capitalist class that must be fought or blunt instruments unable to affect the system in any way.
2. The ICL is for proletarian organization completely outside and against the unions.
3. The ICL believes that communists should work inside the unions to spread the revolutionary programme, although we should never merge with the union.

#### National Liberation
1. The ICL does not support any “national liberation” movements or ideologies and views them as bourgeois.
2. The proletariat itself must revolt across the globe to establish a global proletarian dictatorship, instead of the whole of the “colonized/imperialized peoples” revolting and establishing a new bourgeois dictatorship.

#### Parliament
1. The ICL sees parliamentary politics as a bourgeois merry-go-round and advocate abstentionism in elections. Change does not come through the ballot box, but through proletarians taking action against the capitalist class.
2. The ICL chooses to not intervene in elections, but does intervene in the class struggle.

#### Work
1. The ICL stands opposed to mandatory labour and supports the abolition of the division of labour.

#### War
1. The ICL is unconditionally anti-war.
2. It does not support either side in capitalist conflicts
3. The ICL supports proletarian uprising against both sides in wars.
